Looks like you are wondering how the channel is doing and where to go from here, but you probably already know what needs to be done. From what I have notice ,is that on car channels if you get about 20-25% as many views as you have subscribers you are in good shape. When you are below that range you have something going on, either you have a lot of dead subs or you are just not connecting with your views well ( irrelevant content). If I had to guess, I would say it is a mix of both for you. A lot of your OG subscribers are from your BMX days ( was close to a million back then) and you have not really made much BMX content lately. On the other side to make good car related content, you need the team of people to tie up the loose ends. Sounds like you understand this when you said it's hard to do good videos when you have to work on the cars non stop instead of having Alberto fix it. \nSo to me it sounds like your going to have to go back to Florida soon where you have everything setup to do car, drift and BMX videos. I understand that going back has emotional things tied to it, but it might be time to deal with that. You might have to sell that house or something if it is a trigger. You had a good set up down there, BMX park in the backyard , drift and dragstrip close by, and other car YouTubers close by that are killing it ( Cleetus). Just thinking out loud man, you have been doing this for a while and have had a lot of success and know what to do. I think when you get to a place where you are truly comfortable the likes will come back. Wishing you the best man sorry this was such a long Post.", "time": "5 days ago", "author": "Matt Lundquist"}

Otherwise you'd need a real warehouse or build giveaway cars most of the time or maybe sell a car from time to time to kept the fleet size under control.

Alberto might be on board with that sort of project car as well even though it isn't a NIssan or an EVO.  Before you say everyone else has built an FD, which is true for the most part, keep in mind the viewing \"families\" seem to eat it up best I can tell.  I know I do.

{"cid": "UgxnKzJDVpYMBxPyrnx4AaABAg", "text": "I'm sure this won't get read but it's worth a shot. You might need a higher output alternator than your current OEM alternator. You aren't driving a stock Evolution 5. I assume your car has upgraded parts that run off your electrical system, like the fuel pump and etc. Sometimes OEM alternators are ill-equipped to handle the extra load from those upgrades. Maybe you should call an alternator company like Iraggi or Mechman and explain your situation so they can try to help fix the problems you are having. I was having the same issue as you but caused by a different reason. My first vehicle I ever owned had a upgraded sound system. The car was completely stock minus the head unit, 600 watt amplifier, two 12\" subwoofers, four door speakers and an Optima battery. Even with the upgraded battery, the OEM alternator could not keep up and the voltage would drop causing the lights to dim. You might also want to make sure the electrical system is properly grounded. In the car audio world, there is an upgrade called the big three upgrade. It consists of upgrading three wires to a larger gauge wire. The three include the battery ground to chassis wire, the chassis to engine block wire, and the alternator plus to battery plus wire. Also, if the car has a voltage regulator, it might be going bad. Hopefully this helps.", "time": "6 days ago (edited)", "author": "wackomanx"}

Not because i don't like the videos, I only put videos on my favorites when they have information I want to remember or something useful to keep. i don't know if more people think like me but thats why I'm ''picky'' with the likes on videos otherwise i would have my favorites list full of random videos.

I once had celica alltrac that had a bad ground near the stereo that caused this same issue.\n\nDon't make power over complicated. Check grounds and then check any positives that are shorted to ground (meaning a tear in the wire touching the chassis). Also, the alternator probably got week from something shorted to ground and making it overwork itself, the grease would have little affect as it isn't conductive enough and would only affect its thermals.\n\n\nI would put money on that you have a short somewhere, doubt it's in the engine bay since I'm sure you've checked that dozens of times. Check near window motors, stereo, door locks, ecu, gauge cluster, aftermarket gauges, anywhere that could possibly be a short.

The other channels i follow, they don't do that, one video is about a topic and the next one is about something completely different, so that video has to be really good, or have something that catches my attention to get the like.\nFurthermore, i have learnt a lot with your videos, from working on a car, to the language, and that is something that i really appreciate.\nI think you should make more videos like this one, working on your cars, teaching how to do it, including mistakes, as you did in the past ( you keep doing it, but in the past you used to make way more videos working in your cars and teaching us [yes, i know that you now have waaay more things going on, but this videos are awesome too]).

If everyone was forced to give there honest opinion, yes I liked or no I didn‚Äôt like, then it would be easier to narrow down the small details about videos that people don‚Äôt like. Obviously we all like when he does something big. But if you press like on everything then you‚Äôll cancel out someone else who maybe disliked it for various reasons. It‚Äôs one thing if every single upload gassed you up and but you said you‚Äôre doing it out of respect, which maybe isn‚Äôt the best or most helpful reason to press the button. Judge the content of the video, not the creator as a whole. For example, Tommy f yeah is amazing and I respect what he has done, but when that rav 4 pops up on screen I dislike the video. Not to say I don‚Äôt watch it, but I just don‚Äôt care about it. I skip around and probably don‚Äôt finish. I‚Äôm pretty sure youtubers can see these metrics.

{"cid": "UgwsI62E6bHWmU8sYXZ4AaABAg", "text": "I feel like the like button is just another thing I have to worry about as a content consumer and a previous creator. It's annoying, unhelpful, and ultimately not a very useful metric in my opinion. When it boils down to your content, the people who like YOU as a person, your personality, ect will stay and help the channel grow because they stick around. But, if I'm really being honest I'm just lazy and have grown so accustomed to watching the channels I subscribe to that I don't bother thinking about likes on a video, or liking the video because I feel like my subscription is enough. Obviously new people who watch your videos, you want them to hit the like button, but if I'm being honest I think the most important metric is the view count of each video with the mindset that you have millions of subscribers already. However what I think you should really be looking at is how many subscribers CONSISTENTLY watch your videos, and today I don't know what tools YouTube gives creators in terms of seeing that, but if your subscriber viewership is poor that signal to me that something is not up to par with my content or videos ect... So, I would look into that and give that some serious thought and consideration as to why X amount of viewers who are subscribed actually watch. I mean you have channels that have over 10 million subscribers, and they can get millions of views, but how many of those say 2 millions views are from actual subscribers? Personally I don't know, but for a lot of very popular channels it seems like their viewership is more of an artificial and or superficial relationship with that creator. Therefore, I really think that even at a reasonably high rate of subscriptions, say 50%, that 1 million subscribers on a channel with 10 million or so is a retention rate of 10% out of 100. That's. Not. Good. It's not good because it shows that the subscribed viewership isn't actively participating, but more importantly they probably don't care about the creators content. In your case Adam I don't know how to necessarily explain your analytics. Only you can ask your audience what it is that they want to see, and what they don't. But, it is really nice to hear a content creator think about growing their channel in a constructive way. To answer your question if you need to bribe Tommy, no you don't. I don't need something outlandish to like it. I already like it in my head so I feel like hitting the like button is an extra unnecessary step which I already said. This is for Adam, but also for all the other content creators out there. Just keep doing your thing, but forget about the likes, the dislikes, the hate comments, ect... it's all white noise and you've got bigger things to deal with than them. Also I don't comment often on what I really feel because YouTube has never been the kindest to me. However, I care about the progression of this channel and the fact that Adam calls us, \"Family\" shows just how much he cares about his viewers and not just himself. This took way too long to type out but I will not delete it, and I really hope Adam sees it because he is one of the better content creators in my opinion, (again), but I just want him to see that someone else actually cares too.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Headphoneguy96"}

I think it's people being sick of all the dickhead youtubers who beg you to \"smash that like button\" at the start of a video before they've even provided any like-worthy content to earn that \"like\" . You kind of get numb to the significance of what a like even represents .You stop associating a \"like\" with expressing your enjoyment of the content and just dismiss it as some form of currency creators want from you to boost their ratings in the youtube algorithm and give them more clout with advertisers. I wouldn't class you as one of those youtubers but do find that when I really like the content of a video you make , I'm far more likely to engage with a positive comment rather than a like. It's a bit of a catch 22 because you aren't begging for free likes every 2 minutes of the video but at the same time you rarely ask so people forget . You maybe need to find a balance in the middle somewhere .", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Robert Bell"}

My advice is just to remind people to like right in the middle of something really cool going on like mid engine swap or mid race.  Don't do it at the very beginning and don't do it at the end because people might have already clicked off by then.

If something happens in the video that I really don't like, I might remove my like or dislike, but that's rare. \n\nFor creators that are new to me, I usually don't like until I find something cool or interesting in the video. If I can watch another video and I like their content, or I was blown away by one video, I will subscribe.\n\n\nAs far as content, I think I personally like your Florida videos better than Connecticut I think because of the content in them. I still love seeing Tommy, Grant, Jimmy, etc. in your CT videos, but it definitely has a different vibe. However, I know you've expressed that you didn't really want to be in FL right now, but you did say you'd probably be in CT more in the summer because of the heat.\n\n\nI definitely feel like you have a lot of stuff to do, and it has been slightly mundane, but that's not really your fault. Ed from VinWiki actually made it a really good point in his video that he would prefer to watch someone that uploads not as frequently and has more quality content, instead of someone struggling to put content together daily.\n\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I think the best way to look at your videos is that, the daily videos, like the one today, while not as extravagant as FD, Japan, Germany, etc. are still good videos. Of course they'll get fewer views because they're not as extravagant, but that's expected.\n\n\nI think if you focus on making one really baller video every week or two weeks, and take one day of the week off, maybe sticking to always post weekends but have a floating day off during the week, you'll feel a little better about your output.\n\n\nIn reality, you've been uploading nearly every single day for the past few years, and it has to be draining, especially when you have to throw FD, your race team, your business and employees, and everything else going on in your life into the mix. \n\n\nI think there's a lot of ways you could probably improve your workflow to make it a little bit easier on yourself. Just like you did today, don't be afraid to ask us questions, and don't be afraid to take a day off. My brother is my mentor, and in the Software Engineering world, he said you have to have a good work life balance or you literally will want to commit suicide everyday from the stress. I have gotten in that spot before, and I don't wanna see you eventually dig yourself into a hole from feeling lonely.\n\n\nI don't know if you'll read this, but I hope it helps. :)", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "DarkSwordsman"}

Just clean, sand, then clean the surface with brake cleaner before repair.\n\n  Second tip:  for some reason Japanese cars have a lot of parasitic draws on the battery. \n  Use a digital volt ohmmeter on the fused 12v setting. \n  Then go across every fuse in the cars fuse box with the key out of the ignition for 30 minutes before testing.\n\n  With the negative probe grounded at the battery, run the positive probe across the top of the fuses and note which ones still have 12v going to them.\n  After you've written notes of the power draw at each appliance, make sure they've adequate grounding.  If that doesn't let them go to sleep completely, then consider adding a toggle switch as an interrupter in each of their ground circuits.\n\n  If there's an abundant amount of appliances that don't go to sleep after the key is removed for 30 minutes, then you can also consider re-routing everything through an aftermarket fused relay distribution block with it's own ground wire kill switch.\n\n  If the battery dies within a few days after sitting un-started, the problem is very likely that you have a positive to positive short circuit.  Probably from an aftermarket electrical addition. That'll definitely ruin an alternator too. \n  The parasitic draw test will find the problem, as long as you've access to each individual circuits fuse.\n\nIt seems like a lot at first but after you do it a few times, it'll be a peice of cake.

I also hit i like if i feel that is a good edited video, like the music on that is associated whit the rigth spot or something like that. It's hard to find a reason of a like.\nAlso i think that you have to do and document whit the video what you want and like to do because thats what you like, i mean you don't have to do something only because your subscriber want it, you have to follow your passion and film it and if it likes to the subscribers good if it's not no problem there will be someone else who will like it.

Auditography. Hartnett Media, Papadakis Racing.  All of those I smash like, then I watch.  Perhaps it has to do with consistency of content, knowing that things are....perhaps more streamlined with them.  No matter what it's about I know it will be high-grade content, even if it's about a Suzuki Jimny or photographing a 27 year old car, showing how to do safety wire on bolts or showing sick cars with amazing music for 5 mins. I know what I'm getting with them. \n\nIt's like a restaurant you always go to. Perhaps it's not THE best, but it is great value, service and ALWAYS consistent.   \n\nI like your channel. I'm trying to love it, but I am not there.  Your personality has grown on me over the 2 years I've been subscribed.  You're a lot less annoying that TJ üòè (just a friendly dig at a fellow San Diegan). Perhaps sometimes I don't know where your videos are going. Some days they are laced up, like when the Evo content was popping. But somedays...I'm not sure. The vibe feels off or the edits are an odd follow. Like sometimes its putting out content just for contents sake.  So perhaps I don't always smash that like button immediately because of that. \n\nIn the end, you have WAY more subs than me so obviously you've done a lot right. I dont withhold \"likes\" to be negative, but sometimes I am not all the way bought in. But your channel intrigues me enough to venture back.  üëçüèª", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "B.
