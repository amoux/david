I already watched all his old videos and I have literally soaked my pillow with tears like I love his singing but I also miss his old videos and I’m so conflicted. Like I love his new self but he was so special and different to all the YouTubers and I will always miss that. Maybe he will post again after his tour though or he would have broken my heart twice.\n",

Troy always has this type of moving and dynamic songs which make you live and dance in the rhythm. Ariana the same, or even when she sings slow songs, they still make you keep it on repeat in your head. While here, I've got the impression that they just sing, with some intimacy looks and walk around so the video to not be boring. But still, I'm sure that they will rock again next time...but separately!\n",
      "Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late? Take a moment and consider the state of our world: -The Middle East is at the tipping point. -The world hates Israel. -There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system. -There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3). -Racism is some of the worst it's ever been. -Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets. -Perversion is running rampant. -The weather is out of control. -We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a \"right\" to do so. -Education is in the toilet. -Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate. ... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world. None of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc. ... Sounds exactly like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side... Are you paying attention yet? God is screaming at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become \"a ruinous heap.\" It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself. Yet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say…? What if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other? Perhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess. As I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, \"You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems?\" Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole \"God\" business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too \"reasoned\" to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go! Don't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking... Before you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided. Sinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless... Unless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard \"Jesus loves you\" a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought you were so worth the effort that He created you! Or maybe you're wondering, \"How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so \"just and loving,\" explain that one!\" These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with? If you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God: Frank Turek- \"Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case\" Andreas Kostenberger- \"Truth Matters\" Louis Markos- \"Apologetics for the 21st Century\" Norman L. Geisler- \"When Skeptics Ask,\" \"I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist\" C.S. Lewis- \"Mere Christianity\" Lee Strobel- \"The Case For Christ,\" \"The Case For A Creator,\" \"The Case For Grace\" Ravi Zacharias- \"The End of Reason,\" \"Jesus Among Other Gods,\" \"Can Man Live Without God?\" \"Why Suffering?\" Philip Yancey- \"Reaching For The Invisible God,\" \"Disappointment With God\" Also, the \"One Minute Apologist\" right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God. ** Why am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life. Don't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: \"Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.\" Don't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.\n",

      "I like how this music video makes you focus on the music through the way they sing and dance on screen. It's music videos like this one that will become timeless and iconic in the future.\n",
      "this is actually such a good song and it put a smile on my face. idk it just makes me happy and this video oddly fits really well with the song. I'm actually pretty glad troye/the director decided not to go generic and shoot this at a dance club. :))\n",
      "I just have a few things to say: 1. they look like they're having so much fun and it just makes the video! 2. this collab is pure gold and I loooove it so much 3. this video is perfect for the song 4. I love you Troye and Ariana ❤️\n",
      "I'm not one for decoding things but this is the message I get from the music video. It seems like he was daydreaming of what he could have been doing instead of just sitting there, like how he could have seized more memories if he were to sing and \"Just Dance to this\". Thinking of all the things he missed/ could have missed out on in his life. Having fun and enjoying where he is in the moment. Even though nobody is joining along and dancing with them, they don't let other people get them down(the people walking out on them with the nasty faces), they don't let those people get to them and keep on enjoying themselves. Might be self explanatory but thought i should share that♥ The video is simple but that's what makes it so properly beautiful, it shows and sends the message in such a beautiful simple way. PERFECTION! People need to come into watching music videos with more open minds and see meanings and let their mind wander into their own ideas and thoughts on music videos.\n",
      "No hate but he makes me uncomfortable but i like the fact that he made a music video with ariana grande\n",

      "Omg after seeing Ariana fucking make the universe its weird seeing her in a normal music video without all the crazy visuals\n",
      "This is one of the best collabs of all the time ... it has just that vibe that makes you feel like nothing else matters and that you can be as free as butterfly. Absolutely in love from the day one when this song went out, and i fell in love again now while i was watching the music video. More than perfect job 💖\n",
      "This is exactly what happens when I listen to music in public! I just make up a whole dance number in my head and pretend I’m in a music video\n",
      "If y'all don't make a bunch of cute choreography video's to this amazing song 🎶💚🎶💚🎶💚🎶💚🎶🍬🎶🍬🎶🍬🎶🍬\n",
      "IM ACTUALLY DEAD, HOW DID TROYE AND ARIANA ACC MAKE THIS LOOK SO LITTT! SUCH A CUTE CONCEPT, LOVED THE VIDEO\n",
      "Who's here after seeing Sophia Grace and Sav make a music video? 🤦🏾‍♀️😂😂😂\n",
      "Makayla Manley I know what the problem is, you're just jealous of Sophia. So don't call me stupid if your the one acting jealous and stupid yourself. I want to see you try and sing huh since you're very confident. Make a video and sing. So don't say Sophia is a brat, if u can't really sing yourself own.\n",
      "sophia is not better then rosie recently rosie make a singing video and she sounds amasing and rosie is humble not like sophia who is a show off\n",
      "I am literally crying right now now Sophia is great ful and she is nice and amazing and coming back and watching these videos seeing that she pushed Roise away and kicked her makes me feel horrible and Roise is amazing she is ten now and she resently made of a video of her singing and Roise is a very good singer . But at least Sophia changed.\n",
      "Sophia nothing but a fat little turd who knows nothing but to make up fake music videos\n",
      "Niki make a music video with meghan trainor I love you and meghan so much you both are my princess\n",
      "OMG! Sophia litterally hit Rosie's Tiara and later even pushed her away! It's understandible that a lot of people hate Sophia. Plus, she tries to appear funny and adorable but it just doesn't work, it just makes it cringey AF! Like the fact that Rosie is litterally here doing nothing (like in that Caspar Lee playing the triangle and doing a few lame moves while the others are singing, beatboxing and doing quite \"stylish\" moves in his \"Public Singing Prank\") It's litterally cringey AF to see her \"trying to hard\" to appear as something she's not. She's got to show less attitude and let Rosie be part of the \"duo\" too. It looks like Sophia's here for \"the singing and the over-the-top reactions and trying to hard so it just ends up being ridiculous\" and Rosie's here for her toddler, \"prettier\", \"sweet little girl\" looks and some tiny little moves she does just because her parents told her to do so to make people (/the audience) feel that she's fine about not being the leader of the group, but really just Sophia and her parents' follower. Apparently (according to some videos, Rosie could actually sing, so it's quite a shame for them they don't let her a chance because she might very well feel excluded for the duo, becoming more of a solo career.\n",
      "let me sing with you I want to I really do it's been my dream since I was little do you know what that is I know it's hard when since I was little I was free when I want to sing with you got other people singing with you but me I wish I was on YouTube can I make a video on YouTube how can you make a video on YouTube how how can you make a video on YouTube I want to know how teach me teach me how to do that text me back or calling me back or something okay you know you can you cannot call me you can call me back I know you here but you're really people don't like you like this learn just been hard life from me and you I know just because you're my color and if we get sent to Africa it's this is going to be all your fault and you are the worst thing I ever had on YouTube call me back or something bye\n",
      "I don't get it, I can make a video of myself singing to \" Satisfaction\" and will Mick Jagger & Keith Richards come to me and give me everything I want - NO, because it's no big deal ( I still love Ellen)\n",
      "Reading a majority of these comments makes me so angry at how the world has become. Why would you hate on a little 8 year old kid? Calling her 'fat', 'bratty' and 'selfish'? She's a child! If you're a real human with a heart, all you'll see is an excited little girl who has passion in what she's doing. Now as far as those thinking 'Sophia is taking all the attention away from Rose. Poor Rosie etc', if you've watched all their old videos, you'll understand that Rosie chose not to sing and just be there for support for Sophia. So before judging and posting irrelevant comments, understand the facts first. Lastly, for those who say she's 'not talented', 'can't sing at all', go onto her channel and watch her cover of 'Focus' by Ariana Grande. You need to realise that singing itself takes years of technique training to perfect. And for Sophia to be only 8 years old with no singing teacher here, is rather amazing for someone so young. So instead of hating on a kid, fix yourself first.\n",
      "People saying rosie's a poor lil girl used by sophia : you're acting like 8 year old dramaqueens, she's her lil cousin , they love each other how the hell can a lil girl \"uses\" another one. You need to make something of your life. Rosie's simply not as confortable , GET OVER IT. And then , sophia's vocal tricks are INCREDIBLE for her age, that's why nicki minaj told her she was already a superstar. You can work hard to be at the level she's in that video. jealousyyyy .... dang it.\n",
      "@jireh de leon If she is a kid who feel like doing nothing as you said, her parents should have kept her in England not showing up in a national TV programme. Kids don't have to be hyper or bratty or immature. They have to be understood. You are sorry for Rosie because she is next to a hyper 12 y girl who find someone (Ellen) to make sure she get more hyper given her everything she wanted because it bring higher audience. How many kids can meet and sing to they idol?. How many kids in the world can go shopping in a closed shop and be able to choose anything they want? I didn't see Rosie being sad or upset. My point here is if Rosie was on Ellen by herself the majority of people who are sorry for her wouldn't watch 5 seconds of her videos. I would never say something like that to Rosie because you are the one feeling sorry for. Rosie doesn't feel sorry for herself she looks like someone who is enjoying the money fruit of someone else talents. And I sincerely hope that Rosie and Sophia's parents never allowed them to read any comments on youtube.\n",
      "Most parents play the radio while their kids are in the car so I guess this song stuck in Sophie and Rosie's heads. Then one thing lead to another they make a viral video of them singing.\n",
      "Dude, reading these comments makes me so embarrassed to be a human. Get a grip you nasty black hearted soul-less sheeple! These are TWO LITTLE GIRLS. And you people are calling them names!???? that shows what scum you are if you have it in you to hate a video of an 11-year old girl, and truly have hate in your heart directed at her. And about the \"Rosie is better! Sophias spoiled OMG Becky did you hear Rosie on backup? TOTES better!\" Some children just have a more dominant nature, and some children have a more chill vibe. They are CHILDREN. They're not even fully formed n functioning beings yet you MORONS. They are still growing and learning and becoming different human beings. I swear lately every single day i see at least one thing from human beings that disgusts me to the core. Bless both of these little girls parents because not only are they making sure their children have amazing opportunities, but they clearly have to be thick-skinned because of ignorant sheeple. If anyone ever called my little girl any of the names I see people calling Sophia I'd... i'll leave that statement for the imagination. Bottom line, I'm sensing some jealousy that Sophia is just a naturally outgoing and creative little girl. She clearly has tons of natural energy and drive, and thats somehow a bad thing? Were her and her parents supposed to say \"Na Ellen, were good. No big deal only the biggest opportunity my little girl might EVER get that could help propel a future career, but no thanks, peace.\" Lmao im starting to truly believe that there is only like 1% or less of America's population that is not delusional, brainwashed to the MAX, ignorant, soul-less, straight up MEAN, and judgmental as hell but only when the microscope isn't on THEM. Wake up and look at yourself people. And Congrats to Sophia and Rosie, and your parents, you are two STELLAR, BEAUTIFUL little creatures, both in your own amazing ways. Wish yas nothing but success and happiness.\n",
      "Cute but, the wigs look retarded and it makes no sense at all that Rosie goy that little attention blur that's not unusual because Rosie barley pays attention probably when there rehearsing there dances....and yall that's making fun of Sophia size please stop because her size is perfect and there's nothing to complain about it j should like this video is your mature.... Like forreal\n",
      "@mary aguirre Why are people commenting on Sophia pushing Rosie and kicking Rosie while Nicki lifted Sophia up? THEY ARE ON STAGE, ON FREAKEN NATIONAL TELEVISION!!! PLUS, THEY ARE LITTLE GIRLS AND BOTH ADORABLE!!!!! It's called BEING NERVOUS IN FRONT OF A PUBLIC AUDIENCE, AND MILLIONS *(if not billions!!!) OF VIEWERS!!!!! I'm sure Rosie didn't do it INTENTIONALLY, PLUS SHE IS SO ADORABLY HHHHYPER!!!!! I would just LOVE to see what all these people making comments about Rosie's actions, WOULD REALLY DO AND ACT LIKE IN FRONT OF A PUBLIC AUDIENCE, ON A SHOW THAT'S VIEWED BY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AAAAAND IN FRONT OF A CELEBRITY THEY TOTALLY ADORE!!!! + Sounds like many of these comments are coming from KIDS that are green with envy AND DON'T HAVE THE NERVE NOR COURAGE TO DO WHAT BOTH OF ROSIE AND SOPHIA HAVE INDEED ACCOMPLISHED!!!! INSTEAD OF POSTING YOUR JEALOUS WORDS ON HERE, MAKE BETTER USE OF YOUR TIME AND GO FIND \"YOUR OWN\" PURPOSE IN LIFE!!!!! I'm TERRIFIED for our future AND WHERE ARE ALL THE PARENTS IN ALL OF THIS BS!!!!! It's nothing but \"f\" this and \"f\" that ON HERE...and I have clicked on the WORST COMMENTS ON HERE....dude! They are all kids!!!! AND STUPID ONES....ESPECIALLY THE ONE UPLOADING VIDEOS OF HERSELF FEEDING HER STUPID BIRD!!!!! Where's your \"sorry excuse of a Mom\" at?\n",
      "It just makes me angry. There is even a part of the video when Sophia pulls her arm away from Rosie. Poor little girl.\n",
      "I'm reading the comments posted & you people do realize these are children and one of them is a BIG Nicki Minaj fan. Gosh stop trying to make things more than they are and just enjoy the video. JUST LIVE IN THE MOMENTS OF LIFE AND STOP TRYING TO TAKE AWAY OTHERS MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS.\n",
      "oh wow i would love to be sophia grace and rosie i love all there dresses i wont to know where you got them from also i would love to meet nicki minaj she is my Favourite singer i love sophia grace and rosie i wont to meet them so bad i been hanging to meet thwm also i would like ellen to see all my videos to see if she can make me famous i wish but not really any people watch my video well i only just posted them.\n",
      "Dump the little dumb blond Sophia. You have carried her for 3 years and helped make her famous. If some people think Rosie is so great let her release her own videos. You won't see any because she is useless at singing or anything else.\n",
      "After having a health scare a few years ago (I'm going to be okay) I wrote out a list of the 200+ things I want to do before I die.

      "@whisperingn00b the music industry makes pop songs, the record executives, the labels the songwriters that they PAY to make nicki minaj's songs, they're the ones who create modern pop music (the majority of it anyway) and decide what goes into videos. if they make clean catchy pop records children will still like it and will still buy it, because they are children and basically buy whatever the record industry bombards them with. so there's no need for them to be bombarded with this overly sexual, adult content. it didn't use to be this way. now pop records are full of all this dark stuff, it makes me sad. i had two ten year olds telling me that they watch porn the other day, really really fucked up and sad. i think anyway\n",
      "@whisperingn00b i want to aggressively troll you for saying that, but you're too sweet so i can't. but do you think these are songs made for adults? doesn't nicki minaj do like teen choice and all that shit? i don't know but probably. she's a manufactured artist, i don't want to get into why that's bad. it's fine if you're an adult and can accept it for what it is...pop music is art, fine, but nicki minaj isn't \"the artist\", it's more like she's an instrument being played by someone else. someone else is writing lyrics about selling coke or whatever., about sexin random people, it's not nice. and they try to make it appeal to small kids as well as people in their twenties, so as a result you get stuff like in this video (with the kids). hmm... it's late i can't get my thought out properly lol...oh well\n",

She shouldn't get much attention for standing there. I'm pretty sure if the original video just had Rosie, no one would be on Ellen. Let the person who got them there talk.\n",

What do you think she is going to tell them to go out and smoke all the drugs they possibly can? You're such a dumbass, with no sense at all. Even if she blows all her money some day, she will still have more than you kid. Not a try, I know this. Just from your ignorance on here, who clicks a video just to post trash? Yeah, the loser does.\n",

      "acctually, rosie isnt meant to sing? they even say that on one of the videos. She just makes sophia more confident, also she is just meant to dance and sophie sings, look up the video if you dont believe me....so dont say stuff like that without knowing the whole story! i hate people like that!!!\n",
      "The only reason Rosie is there is because Sophia said she makes her feel comfortable on stage, listen to the video....\n",

However, after seeing the video, I scrolled down to view the comments and it's truly sickening what a lot of you are saying! I am annoyed not by the girls and the video but by the posters of these awful comments!!!! I LOVE THIS CLIP. I think Sophia is Amazingggg and I think Rosie is very supportive. Nicki and Ellen were perfect! Favorite part: when Sophia yells, \"I'M THE SECOND NICKI MINAJ\" lol ADORABLE!\n",
      "wow tht liittle girl wuz gettin it tht makes me wanna post a video of me singing nicki and saying how much i love her\n",
      "Why you guys don't get it... Rosie was invited to the show in order to not make her look excluded, she does the exact same thing that she was doing in the original video (and no one was wrong with that) Get over it already... tryin' to put this super talented girl like the biggest annoying bitch in the world is ridiculous. Give her a break, she only is eighteen years old.\n",
      "Come on people, the crying people are their family - just proud parents.. You can't make fun of that.. And for crying out loud.. they're just children, leave them alone.. just because something has become a viral video doesn't mean that you should troll it and hate on little girls.. The little girl is not sad.. she's only 4 years old.. she just don't really get what's going on.. And I actually think that Nicki is being really sweet towards the girls :)\n",

      "I don't understand why all those dumbasses are crying. The kids don't have cancer or aids, they're not dying, this wasn't a \"Make a Wish Foundation\" thing. They're stupid brats who were probably encouraged by their fame-whoring parents to make a dumb video and now Nicki is only visiting them to keep her fans thinking she's \"all about the children.\" Society sucks.\n",
      "@dantastic87 Uh they are like what 7? I dont know, but I'm pretty sure they dont know what coke is for all they know its the drink? And NICKI did not make them dress like that? It was their parents in their original video, so why don't you quit blaming Nicki, and use your brain. Ok? Ok thanks.\n",
      "@nickdog313 because it just so happens that an african american child didnt make a web hit video like this little white girl did. nothing against race. its just what happened\n",
      "ok so i don't understand why these little girls get to meet Nicki Minaj and i can't. I could make a video of me rapping superbass, did it on em, blazin, fly, moment 4 life, and any other song by her and i wouldn't be able to meet her\n",
      "why are peeps tryna make Ellen look bad? Rosie barely wanted to talk. In another video, Sophia asked her to answer a question & she told Sophia to answer it. Sh's obviously shy. What's the point of making her feel more awkward by asking her a direct question?\n",
      "This is the defenition of cute just makes me smile aha! and the dude crying is obviously a proud parent!xD and im 16 go watch my cover video and hopefully one day i'll be on Ellen thanks!\n",
      "@MarioCeballosTV Ur obviously a big pussy if U listen to crap like this. Unfortunately 4 U, it's the sad truth, when it comes to music, anything apart from rock or metal does suck. This stuff should B banned. This music sux, the lyrical content makes U wonder who the hell in their right mind comes up with these lyrics, and the videos R just porn movies toned down a notch. Quarrel with me all U want pussy, but if U actually like NM, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Katy Perry, etc, U R nothing short of a fag.\n",
      "@fruityboy13 IKR it don't make no damn sense that mother fuckers claim to hate Nicki Minaj but they take time out their lives to sit there and watch Nicki Minaj's videos and Nicki Minaj's fans videos just so they can talk shit!The haters need to sit their hatin lame asses down somewhere.Nicki Minaj is traveling,making money,and has over 6 million fans but the haters are sitting behind a screen talking shit which shows the value of their lame lives.\n",
      "it makes me sick to watch this video because Nicki minaj is a whore and this 4 or 5 year old girl is stupid for looking up to her. Her parents are even more stupid for letting her listen to this so called music. Does anyone besides me want to point out that Nicki minaj is wearing a bra. Another thing: One Nicki minaj lyric goes \"flows tighter than a dick in the butt\" copy and paste that into google and you'll see. The message of her songs won't disappear with the clean version.\n",

      "I think I know what could make my day now everytime I see this video I can't help but smile throughout the whole thing :)\n",
      "@OhOhSheeiila I disagree , Nicki picks up Sophia and spins her around and walks around with her and makes a big fuss , then gives a awkward polite hug to little Rosie , then gives her no eye contact and doesnt speak to her for the rest of the video , Nicki and Ellen keep calling her a star and ignoring Rosie! Yes I know they are there due to Sophia's singing talent but then why bring Rosie if they are just going to treat her like a spare part , she seemed so forgotten and ignored.\n",

      "Lets be honest, we all hate youtubers that make clickbait, if the video is 13 minutes long, we spent 13 minutes just to see nothing that is shown on the thumbnail. We could've spent the 13 minutes watching stuff that is usefull\n",
      "That awkward moment when you get a makeup ad featuring Katy Perry right before the video 🙃🙃🙃\n",
      "can you make a video about emily browning\n",
      "I like Taylor's music, and she seems like a very funny and kind person. My problem with these videos is they are so fake and planned. I wish they would show the celebrity without stage makeup, when their house is normal and not completely clean, and that they would show their awkward side. I don't find this video relatable. Taylor acts more relatable than celebrities in the other \"73 Q's\" videos, but it is still staged. I find it frustrating when they are made to look perfect instead of showing that everyone is imperfect in one way or another at any given time.\n",
      "Watching this video make feel like watching a POV videos from Pornhub.\n",
      "+Boxin B you speak like you know a ton more about the entertainment industry than I do. Stop trying to make yourself the superior one in this conversation because we probably both know the same of each other. I am not kissing Taylor's ass, in fact I don't even like her that much but I'm taking offence because of you mocking Vogue's video techniques. You hardly seem like the type of person who reads Vogue, so I can only assume you are here to hate on either Taylor or the video itself, which I find extremely annoying and distasteful. I am not being the snobby brat, nor am I ever one, so please refrain from calling me names.\n",

Her search flier (on the pole for Sweetwood Drive, on Morningside Drive, near her De Anza High School, on Valley View Road) ends 'blackandmissing.' Please update the flier and post it at every motel, hotel and gas station. Robots and computers replacing receptionists will make it easier for pimps (both male and female) to traffic sex workers place to place. Most threaten violence or murder of the kidnapped victims friends and relatives. The San Francisco Chronicle did an in depth series on how Korean women are trafficked from Hollywood to San Francisco, and all the organized crime use similar tactics. Many teens are kidnapped to motels in the Vallejo area and forced to sell their bodies on International Boulevard in Oakland, California. Her family wants her home safe. If she does not want to return home, she can complete high school and college courses at the Larkin Youth Center/Project in San Francisco. She can get their phone and adress numbers from one of their many You Tube videos or their Wikipedia web page. Please help copy the LYCP to every city, as well as the Girl Scouts at every K-12 school site. She may be here now if she had attended daily after school Girl Scout meetings to complete home work assignments or attend sports training together with girls her age. Please help bring quality public school funding for classes involving: gourmet cooking, intensive sewing projects, the building trades. Please copy what a Texas public high school has done with the building trades for both male and female teens: see it in the You Tube series: 'Tiny House Communities, How to do it Legally.' These teens who get top training and pass exams to get quality union jobs in the building trades, seem to really enjoy their hands on, outdoors high school courses. FEMA has millions needing decent living space. These Tiny House Communities are a fast, quality way to help meet the basic needs of millions of Americans, including those in Puerto Rico and all the other USA territories. Kids and teens really enjoy designing and building their own Tiny House Community. This is a project that should be taught in every grade because it involves learning about the history of electricity, plumbing, the of architecture and engineering, etc.\n",

      "I love your story SO much. This is no less than a miracle, and to me another proof that ASMR truly is one of the greatest achievements of humankind since we stopped living in tribes 10000 years ago. ASMR literally has the potential to make world a much better place than it has been ever since. And this video of course is one of the best, if not THE best ASMR video of all times 🙏💚\n",
      "I love these types of video's the best. They remind me of my first experiences with asmr as a child when we would play pretend doing hair and make up. So not only are these video's nostalgic but they give great asmr tingles💖\n",
      "Perfection! Wish you can make a similar asmr video to this please :)\n",
      "Hand movements are great for ASMR, in my opinion. Great idea to give them a try! They can be done on their own, and they work great; but in my personal opinion, I really like them in role-play scenarios where they are used to express 'caring for you' gestures, such as in this video. Then I find them really soothing and relaxing. P.S. I used to have a parakeet when I was younger, and he loved when we would do hand movements in front of him (this is way before ASMR was even a thing). He'd bob his head up and down, and dance left and right, it was really cute! Have you ever tried that with your birds? Might make for an interesting ASMR-ish kind of video for your channel. 😊\n",
      "Please do a video on how you do your eye makeup, it’s gorgeous! Thanks for the video 💕\n",
      "You should do a remake of the first haircut video you did. It's by far my favorite asmr video ever.\n",
      "Can u please make a guided meditation video? That would be the ideal 🏆\n",
      "Imagine being her significant other. \"oh, babe you about to make a video?\"..\"wait a second\". Runs..grabs pillow and blanket. Makes pallet on floor. \"ok, you can begin\". 😉\n",

      "Munini - Thank you for your input and yes, I do believe the time is soon approaching. I can write a book but I’ll try not to. I’m a stage IV esophageal cancer survivor since 2003. During a routine upper endoscopy in 2016, it was discovered that I now have esophageal dysplasia, which is basically a precursor to cancer. I’ve gone through cryotherapy as well as radio frequency ablation and both have really taken a toll on me physically, mentally and emotionally. I’m far from perfect and I do have my flaws but I’m the type of man who thrives with just a little tender loving care. My older sister was my go to, my rock but unfortunately she passed away many years ago from lymphoma. Watching these videos are really my only way of escaping from the stress I go through and all I could think about is how great life would be if I had an ASMR type of woman in my life. Instead, I do have a girlfriend that I know loves me but it’s, without a doubt in my mind, a friendship kind of love. I let her move in and she doesn’t even take pride in cleaning, even though I have spent a lot of money and time making it ok nice. My guess is because it’s not her house. She’s almost always in a bad mood, spends her free time playing on Facebook and spends money she doesn’t have. I’ve been on leave of absence from work and she still comes to me asking for money. I wish she remembered how much she used to stress over paying her rent before she came here. Sorry, I know I’m venting but for some reason it makes me feel good getting it out of my system. I often wonder what I’m doing wrong and have even apologized that she doesn’t have the desire to touch or be touched by me. So yes, these videos are the only relaxation I receive on a daily basis. I’m sorry for writing so much, I hope you understand and thank you again. It’s nice to know there is someone out there who listens are cares. ❤️\n",
      "I never watch the video, I just listen to them all. I still haven't found one that makes .e truly tingle but yours is the only one I always listen too. I've ty others and they are just scary. Not yours. I need head to toe tingle videos. Thanks.\n",
      "I never make it to the end. Maria, ever since I came across your videos Ive fallen in love 😍 Thank you for making such great videos for all of us! 💜💜\n",
      "You know... I feel kind of bad... these you tubers make long great videos for us o enjoy and I always fall asleep around the 20 min mark 😂😂\n",
      "When your wife and family don't understand ASMR, and wife gets mad because I watch them at 1am. O well I just put on my headphones and drift away from all the drama. Maria I truly thank you I know you have your own life outside of these Videos but thank you thank you for making them I wish you many blessings and much good luck. I wish could meet you one day and thank you and maybe help make a future video.\n",
      "is it just me that never makes it passed about 10 minutes of maria’s videos? i’m always asleep! to this day i have never heard the end of a gentlewhispering video 😹😹😴😴\n",
      "Semper Ludens You should make a video of your hair.\n",
      "I am desperate to see an updated version of your makeup asmr video- it’s so amazing, I must have watched it 1000 times!!! But you’re always improving and perfecting your art so I think an updated one would be 100% amazing!!! Thanks Maria for your hard work xx\n",
      "It always makes my day so much better when I see there is a new video from you Maria ❤😀\n",
      "Would you please make a similar video with a real wig? That would be even more tinglier ^_^\n",
      "I love the sound of cutting mi hair, but it does makes a difference, if you are actually cutting hair (like a wig or something) or if you just open and close the scissor - anyway, love you and the videos you make, you aare the reason im addicted to asmr.. ;-)\n",
      "I love these roleplaying videos, especially a haircut because it’s such an intimate experience. One idea I had that you could incorporate to really make it more realistic is get one of those styrofoam head and use really cheap costume wigs to actually cut, so we can see the hair and see it being cut off. Just an idea! I still love this video and I love all your videos (been a fan for years now)! Keep up the amazing work!\n",
      "Maria, this is wonderful. You continue to make exquisite ASMR videos. I also wanted to say how much I love the backdrop, your color coordination overall and you hair. You are so pleasant to see on my feed that I feel like you are a dear friend.\n",
      "Maria, I wanted to say thank you for all your wonderful and relaxing videos. Your videos have helped me fall asleep every night for the past year. My friends make fun of me sometimes because I watch your videos, but I just don’t think they have experienced the intense relaxation your videos bring. Although I personally don’t experience ASMR myself, I still find myself watching these videos daily. I hope you continue to thrive on YouTube and also continue creating such videos. Thank you so much for your commitment as an ASMRTIST, as you have truly inspired many people around the world to not care what anybody thinks about you. I love you very much and I hope you will read this with a smile. Thank you for being my inspiration. - With Love, Aspyn Raymond\n",
      "I have yet to manage to make it all the way through this video without falling asleep. I want to hear all of it, but I can't manage! Maybe 7th time is the charm?\n",
      "I wanted my hair like yourss 😂💕 Great video 💕 makes me feel calm and relaxed, thank you so much for making this! (Jealous of your nails tho lol). Love this channel! Great videos!\n",
      "This video is beautiful. Can you make a video with only magazine flipping, touching the pages and soft whispers\n",
      "Maria... I work with preschoolers.. Could you make a video that would sooth them during nap time? It would help them and me!\n",
      "There are many excellent ASMR artists on YouTube. People that make quality videos. But you're the best. So grateful for your uploads. Thank you so much. Greetings and best wishes from Tasmania.\n",
      "Heavenly Controller no wonder YOU look so excited to make a new video after all these years,your probably refreshed in the morning from her ASMR😂😂\n",
      "Aberaham Gonsalez, good question, thank you 🙂 I mostly create videos that I would enjoy watching myself, and as I don't prefer kissing sounds I don't make videos of them. There are alot of great videos out there with this theme to choose from.\n",
      "Horraaayyy haircut time. Great stuff when its rp stuff. Asmr for many im assuming was first experienced in real life when someone was doing something to them or with them in a way not to make them relaxed or intentionally soothe them. My first asmr was when i was 8.. and a teacher was stroking the corner of my exercise book as it hss curled up. And he kept putting his thumb over it again and again and said put a heavy book over that corner. That was my first virgin experience. Ive never got it from someone trying to give me it.. but always from real life situations or rps in videos. Cool\n",
      "Please please please please for the 100 time make a soft voice video with no whispering at all or sounds besides you talking softly. When you only whisper it’s very hard to be free of focus and just relax cause I need to consecrate on your speaking, trying to understand what you’re saying.... I love you and I listen to you every single night. Believe me, you’ll have millions of viewers no matter what you’ll do. So consider my request please please please. Make another trip to Italy or rings collection. But again, no whispers, not this time\n",
      "Dearest Maria💜! Been a fan of you since 5 years and I heard in the latest video QueenofSereneASMR really wants to reach 100k subscribers, since you are a fan of her too (like so many others) ..could you please help her? Maybe you could make a video together of give her a shoutout? That would be an amazing collab btw🤩😍🌸💜 I really hope you will read this so we can all help this awesome creator!😃🤗😎\n",
      "Another great video 😌. I would love love love if you could make a crinkle/tapping video with the comb in plastic & the postcards in plastic gift you got from the secret santa video 🙏🏼.\n",
      "This gives me ‘Russian Doll Does Your Makeup’ vibes, which is one of my all time FAVOURITE videos of yours. You are just so good uuggghhhhh thank you ❤️\n",
      "You are always so lovely Maria, you always make my day! Thank you so much for the care and special attention you put into your videos! 🤗❤\n",
      "I am already loving this video oh my goshhh. But I just have a question, when you make the Russian and English version, you film twice and do all the same things you do but just in the different languages?? If so, that sounds like so much effort especially for a video as long as this. Thank you always for what you do. I’m always knocked out in less than 20 minutes :-)\n",
      "People join google to leave google and make a motivational video hehe\n",
      "Not to bash or anything, but all of this sounds like a typical first world problem. You should visit some underdeveloped countries like the Balkan area in Europe and try to get a software position with 25-30k € yearly post tax pay and try to make the ends meet with paying rent, and living with a wife and couple of kids. You wouldn't be thinking about leaving a $250k+ job at Google then. I know these things vary all across the world, but to most of us this just sounds like bragging. Each and everyone of us is the creator of his/her own happiness and I'm really glad you are doing well even though I don't know you and stumbled upon this video.\n",
      "He left Google to make YouTube videos on \"Why I left Google\". I'm not sure why that career path was not mentioned in this video. I guess it will be explained in a future video titled \"Don't click here. Don't watch this. Seriously\"\n",
      "Jesus these comments, did Google make a retarded bot farm just to post shit on videos that don't say the sun shines out of their asses?\n",
      "Hey techlead dude, don't listen the rude comments. They told you to \"get to the point\" but perhaps you wanted to make a video that you talked about your journey broadly. If they don't see that or not able to skip ot watch the video in faster speed, it's not your problem. I enjoyed watching you speak. Thanks for the video!\n",
      "Long and pointless, so why you left google, dont know and right now beyond caring, but i promise if you make a 20 second video with 20 words or less , id love to watch.\n",
      "You'll never see me again. First you need to learn how to make a video. Then move on. Yuk, waste of time..\n",
      "Drink that shit and shut up, why would u make a video on why u left ur job at Google, who can learn from this? Wtf is happening to the China people!\n",
      "So you can make this clickbait video :)\n",
      "To say this frankly, why do I care that you left your job at \"Google\"? It's just another company. No one gives a fuck. Google hasn't been viewed as remarkable since 2009? They've definitely lost their luster in comparison to other companies like Tesla, SpaceX, even Facebook.There's a reason why it's called a \"job\" and not \"happy fun time\". You keep saying \"6 figure salary\". Salary alone is a really immature way to decide where to work. There are a lot of software engineering jobs at MANY DIFFERENT companies where mid level to senior positions are 6 figures. I feel you're just another sheltered asian kid and you seem just overall lacking common sense. I've had three 6 figured jobs since my late 20's. It's nothing special. 7% to 10% of the population in the US makes at least 6 figures in terms of single earners. That's 21 to 35 million people in the US alone. You're not special. You're situation isn't special. There's no logical reason to create this stupid ass video. Even your advices are stupid. You learn more rapidly at startups. Learning the ropes at a big company...??? No... lol If you're applying for an interview with even a modicum of experience at any company, they'll give you an interview. It's NOT because you have Google on your resume LOL. That's ridiculous. Software Engineers in the US are desperately in demand. You could have an associates from a community college in \"computer programming\" submit a resume at 99% of companies in the US that need software engineers, and they'll give you an interview. Again, you're sheltered and I'm sorry I ran across your video. It's aggravating to listen to stupidity. It's also sad that you believe what you do. And it's sad you're sharing you're erroneous viewpoints. It's probably the most sad that your brain seems to derive incorrect conclusions. You actually called yourself a \"tech lead\". oh my god... get the fuck out of here. Time to hit the dislike button.\n",
      "You can't make a video like this unless you've left a position at BuzzFeed. I'm going to have to report this video to the authorities.\n",
      "Can u make a video on : Node js vs PHp 2018 TechLead:)\n",
      "This is so inspirational. If you could make an 11 minutes video about why you left Google without actually talking about it, I sure as hell could make 1 hour video about why I want to work for Google (without talking about it).\n",
      "Makes $150k+ a year and still puts ads on videos. Nice northface jacket fuckhead.\n",
      "what kind of new, unreleased technologies are they using over there ? make a video on that , I'm intrigued !\n",
      "Im going to make a video on why i left the fast food industry. Its hard to believe, but its not heaven like most people think.\n",
      "this guy had a work contract / work permit from google for 3.2 years..and that time is up hes mad so hes like lets make a youtube channel and make videos i can make money from that just like all the little kids are doing\n",
      "Hey Patrick, thanks for sharing your thoughts, it was helpful to hear. One suggestion I might make -- and I make this to help your channel grow, because I enjoyed this video! -- is to structure your narrative a bit better. It felt like you got lost in your own thoughts in the first half of the video, and then later remembered you should touch on why you left Google. Personally, I don't mind the other things you said, they are helpful to hear as well, but perhaps you can focus on getting to your point first and then mention you have some other thoughts / context you will provide after for those that want to stick around? tl;dr interesting point, but to keep your viewers paying attention I suggest getting to the point faster or working on composing your narrative like a story\n",
      "Who care? You quit every job anyways. Maybe you quit to bark about it online. Look at you a nerd with no friend but want to win google by saying \"google you're not good enough for me so i'll quit and make a video about it to show people that i can\" what a moron.\n",
      "Hi, can you make video on how to be high performer Software Engineer? Great video as always!\n",
      "You make 6 figure salaries, but have a shitty camera? Dude I love your videos but you need to invest more money into better video cameras. The dynamic range in the video is really bad. Look at how the sky is blown out.\n",
      "Very encouraging words! I always thought once Google or Intel hires you, that's it. But when you say you can leave because you can continue your journey that... I just never thought. It just makes everything else seem so possible! I'm so happy I watched this video! Thank you for this insight!\n",
      "Really boring video. Keeps repeating himself. If you make a video saying why you left please come to the point without boring the life out of us. Did Google fire you for being ultra boring?\n",
      "Didn't really say much about the \"why\" for why he left, or why others leave, just a vague statement that people go elsewhere. I know multiple people who work there, some working there for years, and all of them are pretty vague about what it's like to work there, many of the same things he says in the video. Someone I know quit Google because he said he couldn't find a position where he felt like he knew the final impact of what he was doing, he was always writing small pieces of code for a bigger picture and often times the project was scrapped in the middle or would change into something else, or he didn't feel like what he did was very impactful. That could have been a rare example, he wasn't very ambitious to find his own way. I've talked to some others I've met who work there and heard several say that projects get canned all the time or change a lot, so it's tough to find something that feels like you're doing something that is going to be worthwhile, and most of the best projects are taken by the very talented people, or those who have been there a long time. So maybe it's a lot of smart people who want to do something big and grand, but then realize they're just a coder in a large company and will make only small impacts? This is the kind of stuff I was hoping to hear more of from this video, but I did not. I wonder if he'll read this and respond with any insights?\n",
      "All these videos about \"why I quit X video\" is full of shit and just for views. You're a software engineer who can't even make a video on why you quit and just full on dodge the answer by talking about random stuff about google. Can you even answer why you left google in 1 sentence or a short paragraph? Video doesn't need to be 11mins explaining your journey, mindset, and how many free beers and hookers you got at google. Also, the majority of people quit because they are well off already. If you had a 100k student loan debt and got a job offered at google, the majority would stay at google for a long time. 99% of videos like this on youtube that says \"why I quit X\" are just a bunch of people who never had to even work day to day to meet ends meet. Only a silverspoon baby would've quit. Why don't you tell us about all your assets, investments, and other sources of income that you fail to mention?\n",
      "Well crafted engineering? THat's a joke. Google software seems to be written by children. YouTube is a HORRIBLE UI, and the way it's setup is a joke. It's the most convoluted set of settings that does NOT make sense and does NOT make it easy to deal with. Horrible UI and their tech support is non-existent. HORRIBLE company. if there was another site to watch videos that had the same content, I'd be using their service and not YouTube. The ONLY reason to continue to use YouTube is the amount of content, NOTHING else.\n",
      "So that you could make a Youtube video about it.\n",
      "Getting into Google then after 3 years leaving don't make much sense. Maybe being a Software Developer/Engineer wasn't the right career choice. Like working at any other company is a step down career wise and after 3 years is not long enough to learn all what is necessary to become a GREAT developer. There is so much areas of being a developer that takes years to master (project management, architecture design, scalability , coding standards , mentoring, etc) and having an opportunity at Google own your career then leave after 3 years seem to me like you maybe you don't actually like being in software development. I never watched any of you videos before and may be judging you wrongly. So i must apologize if i came off a little too negative. Google is the facto standard (to me) and still I can't understand leaving after 3 years, maybe 5 and then that stretching it. I'm still confused. What was missing? Maybe the reason I cant understand is because I have such high regards for person who work there and I am currently owning my own skills to feel competent enough even apply. Been doing this professionally for over 5 years and been doing development since j2me java days, on the wap making wml websites in high school and I still feel like I haven't learnt enough to get the rights to apply. #firstworldproblems\n",

      "Such an amazing video!! Thank you for sharing your personal journey to Google. Please make a video on tips for recent college graduates!!!\n",
      "I realize and appreciate that. Still makes it difficult to watch. It works very well when listened to without watching the video, which is unnecessary anyway. Trying to watch it made my brain hurt.\n",
      "Like I said, why don't you make a video of yourself talking and show us how it's done?\n",
      "More than just sitting there staring at the computer. It just looks like programmers are staring. But really we are thinking about the logic, thinking about a problem, how to test the problem, how to make it faster, how to make it more modular, more efficient, more functional, etc. It's a lot like kids who can sit and play video games all day long. It feels like a video game because you are challenged to solve a problem or even just one aspect of a problem and when you think of a solution it's fun! It's not really frustrating when it doesn't work right away, it's more of a feeling of being confused because you thought you checked everything before you compiled your code, but now you have an error. So you wonder why you have an error, what could have caused it, what did I miss? and you start your investigation. It's like playing a role playing game rather than playing a shooting game though.\n",
      "I am very thankful for you sir that you make a video for us.. Sir I want to get a job in google, can you please guide me how to prepare of myself for google.. I am the fresher but I am very passionate about my work and code. So please guide me\n",
      "Hey, do you have a video or a blog, talking about topics that we should know to be a good software engineer?, if nothing, please make a video for it, Thank you!\n",
      "I'd to point out that \"long periods of time\" is completely contradictive to \"learn quickly\"... As a developer of 14 years, in the context of this video - if I have one thing to add - it's don't listen to about 95% of what this guy is saying. There's no single way to write code, and that should tell you there's no one way to LEARN to write code. Sitting down for long periods of time is a horrible method for lots - most - people. Stagnant learning... Your brain doesn't just magically erase information. When you learn, walk away (for a specific amount of time - Google it..) and return to that subject, the material will start making more sense, faster and will remain in an accessible area of your mind where it can be readily used. Had anyone ever been told to just \"walk away\" or to \"take a break\" when stuck on a problem you needed to figure out, after working on it for long periods of time? As to \"old people\" being outdated: this is a dipshit stereotype. Your brain retains am infinite amount of knowledge. Therefore, a healthy brain can learn as much. The reason a veteran lawyer and doctor make more money is because there GAINED MORE EXPERIENCE and know HOW TO DO THINGS that the less experienced DO NOT. Do you really think there's anyone that knows everything a doctor can know? A lawyer? The difference is that we are constantly learning new technologies that accomplish many similar tasks using more efficient methods.... Please do research on how the human brain works and give compelling and competent examples before someone that doesn't know any better comes across your video and you cause discouragement. What is the matter with you. Finally. Don't try to learn anything \"easily\" and \"quickly\" because the quick and easy way is how you end up painting yourself in a corner years from now. A good foundation leads to a steadier structure. Jesus bro.\n",

      "Patrick you are THE MAN! Stumbled across you a few days ago, have watched a few of your videos and love them all, will be watching many more now. You're a young man who doesn't start out by telling us how great you are and why we should listen to you because of this or that. You just give us great advice and information, and that speaks for itself big time in my book. With this video, you just gave this 62 year old some of the best advice about learning to program. I did some extensive database programming using FileMaker Pro about 20 years ago, put a number of small & large databases on the web then which was a great feeling to do using a 66Mhz processor Mac server with 64MG of RAM and a 250 MB hard drive. (LOVED FileMaker back then, then they went and crippled the web functionality and limited the number of consecutive connections one could have to a database unless you paid them stupid amounts of money for server versions of the software, so I walked away from it. And I've never found another database development platform as good as that one since.) I also built a lot of websites back then from '95 to '02, then drifted away from the online tech world and back into aviation which is my original career. But I certainly know what being in the zone is all about and I love it, the feeling of creating one's own app's is unmatched. Now I have a ton of online projects that I want to get going, and am trying to get back into it all. I hear what you say about learning the basics, and all the information is \"out there online\" or in books, but the questions is: WHICH book, and WHICH SOURCE OF ONLINE TEACHING? I've been buried with so much information in the past year of research, and I've found that it's VERY difficult to find a YT channel or Udemy course that is the right fit for what one is wanting to do (in my case, that's building various web projects with database backends, some pretty complicated). I've started watching or learning various courses, then find after a few hours that the presenter is going off on a track that isn't what I wanted to learn, or they are way above my skill level, etc. So if I may suggest, here are two great videos for you to do for us - 1) Tell us HOW TO GO ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT SOURCE OF INFORMATION in order to learn programming. Which are the best websites or online learning platforms, which are the best teachers for the programming languages you mentioned in the video, etc. Also include a section or even a new video, about how to decide on which programming language or development platform to use, but be more specific about which languages are best for which specific kinds of applications. For example, I have a number of web database projects I want to build and launch, but WHICH database platform do I use? (There are dozens and dozens out there, many way too expensive for what I can afford or want to do online). 2) Another good video would be to tell us what kind of hardware and development software we need in order to get started, and then also for more advanced uses. Then also show us how to set up one's workspace, the use of multiple screens, and generally how to set up one's \"development environment\" for programming in a very efficient manner. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THIS. Or none that I can find and respect. They all just say \"sit down at your computer and start this or that\", then they show a few shots of THEIR desk area and screens and working layout, and it's HUGE and has all sorts of stuff on it. Having worked on databases in the past and doing intensive work on it, I know that back then it was VERY important how I set up my computer, my workspace on the screen, what 'side apps' I used for this or that, etc etc. And that was starting out on a MacPlus screen! But I can't find anyone who is telling us how to get best set up in this way today. I could write you a course outline on what to teach, but I'm sure you can figure it out yourself. Just think of a newbie or old-timer like me wanting to get back into the development / programming game or getting back into database work, and what they need to know FROM SCRATCH considering the technology and software of today. Anyway, I've written was too much already, but I hope you get the idea. Just giving us very general guidelines is OK, but it leaves us learners wading through the unchartered waters of program development, looking for the best way to get things done, while the sharks keep circling around us trying to sell us all their cr*p. Instead, if you could suggest to us exactly which is the best book to learn PHP, or which is the best course or website to learn Python from, and so on for other languages, now THAT would be really useful. Love your stuff, keep it coming, wishing you all the very best.\n",
      "I think you make some great points but also i would add that people should not be afraid to get stuck sometimes too. I think that is a very intimidating spot, esp for beginning coders. Learning to code is not just going through tutorials but also getting stuck or running into errors and needing to debug your code. It teaches you to look things up on google and Stack Overflow and other great sites. Even finding solutions on YouTube that other people have run into when doing the same thing. Its that getting stuck somewhere and figuring it out that really makes someone feel good and more confident in their abilities too. As we get older in life its good to have things that challenge us to grow and get out of our comfort zones. Thats why i think programming is such an awesome field to be involved with. There is always something to learn and also it gives you ideas for developing your own frameworks to share with others too. Great video, keep up the great work.\n",

      "DaKxlllah. Well, if there are videos like this, what do you think? You can do everything without a degree, but that doesn't make you credible... Sure, some people succeed by showing their talents to Google or whatever company, however that's not something you should rely on.. You should go to college if you can for almost any case.. Just imagine.. If people struggle to find jobs with their college degrees, how would one get a job without a college degree? It's based on pure luck, so I will say it again, just go to college.. Don't buy into the bullshit spewed in multiple videos by the top 1%. You're not them, and it's a risk to be like them.\n",

      "I do agree that all companies are free to interview to any bar they desire and for whatever they hold important in an SWE. I also agree there should be knowledge of fundamentals at all levels. My question may be biased more towards the top companies which all have similar interview styles. I'm not trying to change it per se, as if you want to work at these places you have to play the game, but have a discussion about the pros/cons of this way of interviewing. I feel knowing your fundamentals for Data Structures and Algorithms and being able to problem solve leetcode to the level of top companies, 2 mediums in 30 minutes, isn't 100% related to job performance. Yes, having the both abilities is awesome and I would say that would define a \"great\" or \"top\" candidate, but usually this leaves \"good\" candidates to not make it and I think they can be valuable for all companies. Many of them can even grow on the job and turn in to \"great\" in the long term. I know many experienced people that can tell you how any random data structure works the big O and all that information, but give them a random medium leetcode question and they won't come up with a perfect solution in 30 minutes. They may give you a solution in that time and then from there can talk about how to optimize it if there is time left over, but getting to that final optimized solution seems in time really seems to be the bar. Though give them 3 hours and they will have an optimize working solution for you with minimal help. Obviously the phone screen cannot last 3 hours as that is crazy, but it seems there should be a happy medium where thought process, how your attacking the problem, how you organize your thoughts, and understanding how to get there is more important than if you got the answer perfect. My experience has been you need that perfect algorithm to the problem written out or is basically a failed interview with reasons being too slow. Again companies are free to do what they want, but I feel they are leaving a lot of good talent on the curb and maybe they need to rethink what they are doing. I have no experience at actual hiring at these companies so I can't say if I even understand their mindset to hiring correctly. I know I do interviews for where I work and there are many good programmers that aren't getting in to top companies that we love hiring. They are still smart and want to learn, but is slower at problem solving. Also knowing what a hashmap is and recognizing that you should use one here are two different things. I feel many interviewers at top companies see knowing to use it in this situation as trivial, because they are good at this so you must not know about it if you don't see to use it. These candidates still produce great work on the job that I think top companies would be fine with, but it takes them 14 hours to complete the work instead of 4 hours. So you get less output long term, but that can be made up with either more resources or a longer schedule. Is this slower person really a negative for a top company? Do the truly great and top SWEs get annoyed when it takes somebody else longer to get work done than if they just did it themselves and the high bar is to appease this group of SWEs? It's not about being late on promised work, but more I need 14 hours to get this task done and cannot do it in 4 hours even though you can. I thought it may be an interesting video to make as I was looking to make sense of their process and why the are optimizing for a specific type of SWE. This is coming from somebody that does not work at a company that everybody desires to work at. So my perspective may be so different like a poor person understand the decision making of a wealth person that I just don't see it. Sorry for rambling on a bit or if this is a dumb question as I just don't understand the process at top companies. I know you have been involved in this a lot at you past job so I wanted to hear some of your insight. Thanks for reading if you got this far. lol\n",
      "Hi Patrick. I think two other important qualities which programmers should have are perfectionism, as it will make you want to code cleaner, and simple greed). For example I motivate our company juniors by telling them that each well understood uncle bob’s videolection or mike ashes series of articles potentially increases their salary by 5$ per month. One of the greatest benefits of our profession is that to some point, tech knowledge directly influences salary, which is not so true for other professions like designers or writers.\n",
      "Here's what stood out to me, and what makes this so inspiring, powerful, and exciting: Kelvin's motivations are the pure motivations of a 15 year old from a collectivist culture- that is that he wants to help his family.

      "\"...does not appear to have ever been invaded...\" raises TWO debates: \"appearance\" and \"actual\". That it does not appear does not mean it isn't. And if it happened and traces are not evident, it still did happen. Additionally, there is no evidence that Earth is geotypical. It's not even tectonically similar to Mars and Venus. That's just one indication that there may be a uniqueness we cannot notice that makes Earth the most valuable plant in the galaxy. Also, if space is curved, and there are wormholes that could be traversed, then space may be infinite but also not linearly huge at all, Every argument in this video fails these faults. And that's just for starters.\n",
      "I'm going to make my own 10 reasons video. I'll call it 10 reasons for 10 reasons.\n",
      "@John Michael Godier First of all, what sort of evidence are you looking for that will prove that to you? Ancient statues of alien overlords? alien weaponry that has somehow shown to be from another planet? An old written account on papyrus? Second of all, there are a LOT of places on this earth that are largely unexplored, the bottom of the ocean, huge underground crevices, dont get me started on the arctic circles, also you seem to assume that if any \"evidence of an alien invasion\" was anywhere to be found it would be reported on cnn and you would definitely know about it. Keep in mind that this earth is very old, and only a very small part of that timeline is somewhat documented , erosion and plate tectonics among other things might have completely destroyed cultures much older than you can conceive of. There are plenty of life forms that dwell on this planet that have yet to be discovered and even the ones we have discovered still baffle scientists and dont fit the so-called \"evolutionary tree\". Also what makes you so sure that an alien race would be your size, have your ambitions, the need to \"invade\" , there are life forms and civilizations at different scales. There are plenty of sightings that are unexplained, not just by \"conspiracy nuts\" but by proffesional people as well unless you just want to write them off as crazy people. You need to be a little more humble and consider that you dont know what you don't know instead of being arrogant like black science man, robot on wheelchair(rip) or guy with bowtie and a lab coat. How can you make a video saying \"its nowhere to be found\" since you yourself have not looked inside every single crevice of this earth?\n",
      "How would YOU know there is no II or III civilization, and what makes you think they haven't harnessed something BETTER, or gone beyond the need! I guess you never saw things like V! In V, the raw material is WATER! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? There are BILLIONS of slaves on the Earth! And I am only including HUMANS in that number! AND, AGAIN, you are NOT talking about ALIENS! How do you even know they have even the CONCEPT of taste? Besides, what We hate, others LOVE! Such taste disparity is common EVEN AMONG HUMANS! Following in the line of this video, Martians wouldn't come here because...... 1. Being green, they would have trouble even seeing their HANDS on lawns, at least in summer. 2. They would have probems hurting anyone, because they are so short!\n",
      "Yeah, that's just the same anthropocentric new age claptrap people have been parroting for the last 30 years or more. It's good fodder to make cable television shows, YouTube conspiracy videos and write books about to sell, but the actual evidence is invariably scant and anecdotal. Nobody can show anybody anything, even after that much time. And, as far as war, for all you know alien civilizations run on WAR and conquest, they may be far worse than we are; there are no guarantees. And no, a couple of thousand years ago they didn't even have a concept of space much less how it actually works. They were still mucking around with celestial spheres back then.\n",
      "This video makes quite a few assumptions about alien beings, and we know what many assumptions make a person into. We don't taste good to them? Who knows? We would make for a poor workforce? If they had the right technologies and/or mental abilities, we could be controlled as easily as insects. And as for the video stating that Hollywood usually portrays us as helpless against an invasion, but the reality is actually the opposite, uh...no.\n",

      "You both omitted something important around the middle of your conversation.(weed tends to do that. Makes your thoughts gambol and trip out. Thats where the euphoria arises.) There are a million Elon Musks. Just 98% of them are prevented from developing their ideas by their poverty & their social surroundings. The solution to this is where the one or few successful Elons reach out to collaborate, educate and fund the rest to expand their experiences. You can only do what you can do. Trying to do that is enough. Be satisfied with your efforts and try not to feel guilty about your success because all you need to improve it, is share it. Good video. Nice idea.\n",
      "The best interview of Elon I’ve ever seen. Great job joe in bringing out the person behind Tesla rather than the face of Tesla. If that makes sense. Lol thanks for the great video.\n",
      "There is no doubt this man is a genius but this interview proves a point I have learned from both history and my own experience. The USE and LIMITATIONS of genius. At the inevitable risk of being accused of boasting I will explain the limitations of genius through my own example as there is no other way to honestly do so. My IQ is 164, for example, yet in many things I find I am LESS than average because I cannot make myself focus on what I feel is irrelevant and boring. I am no Tesla or Musk, even the few Elite are not and my intelligence is NOT technical but creative and philosphical yet I am as dumb as an ox in everyday stuff just as Einstein also was. I have had daily visions of the coming global genocide ever since I was about 10 (1971). I have heard my own symphonies complete in my mind every day since I was about 5 or 6. Indeed my parents thought I was insane as I used to rock my head and grind my teeth to the music in my head as a rhythm section. Everyday I get new ideas and I have also written tales and invented entire worlds of my own. For me a puff of weed feels like an acid trip. My brain never shuts the fuck up and I have been like this for 57 years, It's not all fun even if sometimes it is ecstatic. Consciousness has many forms and awareness and imagination can be quite different than brilliance in Math's and technical issues I have had no ambition in the outer world but like Elon I MUST create everyday or my anxiety levels goes off the scale. I love short term company as my break from manic creativity and I have more ideas than I can ever follow through with. Political, philosophical, musical (I play all the 12 or so instruments in my studio inc classical, jazz, rock, Xtreme metal being self taught in most). I have performed violin and sang Bach and Mozart with orchestras, played with musicians who earlier played with Miles Davis and John Coltrane as well as performing acid rock operas in CBGB's in the late 80's and early 90's. I have written plays, translating entire ancient texts like Virgil's Aenied when merely 8 and was an Oxbridge scholar, allowed to complete my Harvard education in 2 years (I instead chose to go to UC Berkeley) starting when still only 16. Elon is not smart in all areas (like I am almost retarded in technical areas and practical everyday stuff) just as this video shows so clearly. His USEFULNESS is merely technical and this is because science has cursed us and our ape spiritual nature while making things easier yet more complex and so we end up in the tragic situation we find ourselves in today with shallow crap philosophers like 'guru' Jordan Peterson whose childishly simplistic views, for example, are popular to the shallow and not smart, to whom he cynically appeals, by flattering his niche audience's emotions over the needs of the HUMAN race. There is also emotional intelligence and the ability too sense a persons energies and intentions as well as in animals. Right now mankind is in a do or die situation in our evolution on this the planet (nukes, war and over population). We must learn to survive together BEFORE we move out into space as technology and capitalism MUST be chained to human needs on a global scale and not allow it to grow like a cancer as cells become when unhealthy. Science has replaced God and like him will bring the flood. 'God' is the universe and we who live are the brain cells in the body of the universe that is God's body. It is not even about being original but being insightful and some truths remain while others evolve. All things we know or feel are human and all philosophies we know have SOME insight and much ignorance as most 'followers' have an emotional attachment to one or the other instead of seeing that what seems to be opposites in our minds are but are nothing but the SAME truth seen from another angle. Emotions and our ape nature are not WEAKNESSES but assets nor are our instincts (unconscious awareness before it becomes conscious), they are necessary and need enhancing NOT muffling or suppression. It is NOT one thing verses the other (the lizard Social Darwinistic vs the compassionate empathic aspect) as the simple want it to be. We must evolve into a universal consciousness but we are regressing NOT advancing. Science is making us weaker (sabotaging evolution) but it does not need to. We need BOTH capitalism (individual) AND socialism (the group) just as we NEED men and women and body AND mind as they all are better at different things and are essentially one anyway. We must evolve OR die. I fear/know we will die as we are if we continue as we are (yes the irony). Since the 1960's (the height of Western culture) we have slowly and with increasing speed declined and our politicians (criminals along with the oligarchs who really run us) have sold humanity down the drain and technology will be used to make freedom and privacy an impossible dream until the inevitable coming global genocide that the Elite plans for us comes. One does NOT need to be brilliant to see this. One merely needs to open one's eyes and be open to the painful truth by letting go of our attachments and stupid insecure pride. Love and passion IS the answer but I am NOT talking about simple naivete or innocence but the balance between what is and what is possible and healthy as both sides (Dark vs Light) are necessary to our SURVIVAL and we will need to make necessary but painful decisions with love as the adjudicator. Let the Elite decide and they will opt to continue THEIR lives unchanged while solving the problems of overpopulation/pollution for example by moving towards the final solution of mass genocide of the now unneeded masses as the non Elite classes will allow a servant population for pleasure and machines for workers. THINK ABOUT IT!\n",
      "GREAT VIDEO! I am of the belief that the solution lies in the understanding that true love another cannot occur without genuine forgiveness. Imagine for a second what your level of love would be like if #JUSTFORTODAY you forgave one person (it might be yourself) that you have been majorly upset with b/c they let you down so bad. Remember forgiving them does make what they did ok, it just helps you unload the stress and burden of hanging on to anger and resentments. Being a part of creating a fantastic future that benefits everyone is something that brings me immense joy; so whenever videos like these show up it makes me happy because of the awareness they create and also lets me know that I have compadres curving out the paths that lead to the betterment of humanity.\n",
      "How is he rare ??. Having billions of new ideas and how to improve other things are easy...And i am very sure there are many more like me. Just something simple: I know how you can make instant communication even video over endless distance.... i just do not have money to start it. the idea is in my head, one among billions more ideas. Instant communication is far easier that people think also. Sure, you can probably make trillions $ on it if money is the only thing you value..... but it cost some first to make.. and there is the problem in why you humans are stuck, and advance so slow. You humans value money more than anything else....pathetic.\n",

      "Everyone that's hateing on the way Joe interviewed Elon needs to think about the fact that Elon has been threw hundreds if not maybe thousands of interviews. An there always the same they just ask the same questions or similar questions an even the dumbest questions anyone could have asked that I've seen make Elon kinda almost get pissed off at or tired of or even confused from how dumb the question is. Ill admit joe wasn't asking the questions that people would ask Elon. But there questions an thots that you could tell made Elon step back an think for a second here an there an even had him talking about things you usualy wouldn't talk about or even think about. So I'd image that this is probley one of the best interview's he's ever had. I mean come on people we have a video of Elon musk smoking weed how crazy an awsome is that.\n",
      "Sucks to suck. Weed is barely even a drug. It just makes you lazy and hungry. For a guy that works as much as him, it would actually level him out from what is obviously an extreme amount of daily stress. It's kind of selfish of you to ask people who are making the world a better place to just suffer through the negatives, simply because you personally disagree with mitigating options like responsible and medical use marijuana. I'm not even pro-smoking, but I don't think outdated \"puritan\" sensibilities should limit free choice for something that's proven to be less fatal than alcohol (which is absurdly glamorized). BTW if drugs are anything that alters your mindset, then caffeine, sugar, and even chamomile tea are all drugs. So are video games, your favorite comfort foods, puppies, and babies. Not to mention the concept of the weekend, holidays, vacations, and getting presents on Christmas. Anything that makes you feel \"good/better\" that comes from outside your own mind is technically a \"drug\". Feel free to apply for any Tesla HQ position outside of sales and marketing if you want to have people manifesting a technical and social revolution that don't do drugs. But then you'll have to get promoted to HR Director, CEO, or become a ranking board member, THEN you can fire everyone who does drugs, and hire people who don't. Except good luck, because the stark majority of millennials have been smoking weed or regularly consuming(or abusing) some kind of drug (ranging from caffeine to meth) since they were 15/16. And millennials are important because those will be the applicants you're gonna face in 4-12 years assuming you're CEO/HR/Board member by then. Oh and if you bothered to check your moral outrage, you wouldn't have skipped over the fact that 1, it's legal just like alcohol, 2 his phone blew up with concerned family and friends because of that 1 puff, Which means 3, he's not a regular drug user (he even said himself that he doesn't partake), and 4, he also said it didn't appear to have an effect and he's just generally not interested. Which is 5, evidenced by the fact that he didn't even try to get the effect with additional attempts.\n",
      "Okay so what does that have to do with Elon Musk being there smoking weed and drinking whiskey he is a grown ass man. he can make his own decisions why would you think Joe Rogan would set him up he could be like no I don't want to smoke weed or I don't want to drink man you sound very fucking ignorant keep popping those pain pills buddy and watching conspiracy videos on YouTube. So delusional.\n",
      "Thank you for not passing judgement on this guy and trying to make this some bashing video for him drinking or smoking. Like the other channels 🙌\n",
      "This TED talk was truly inspiring. I am entering a season of my life filled with uncertainty and doubt looking for what I am going to do post graduation, who I am going to work for, and ultimately the type of person I want to be. Along with that I am saying goodbye to an organization that has been a leading cause for why I have been so happy here at CSU my sorority of 70 women Alpha Delta Pi. As I enter my senior year in the sorority I want to bring in girls that will continue to set a good example on the campus, who will work to better those around them, and who ultimately want to make a difference on the campus and in the world inspiring others. As recruitment is approaching I feel I can take a lot of lessons from this short 18 minute long video. \"Why\" do I do it, well thats easy because I wanted to be apart of something bigger then myself, I wanted to make genuine connections with like minded people, I wanted to be held accountable, I wanted to make a difference. Now how did I do it, I not only joined the sorority but I became an officer holding a leadership role, and got involved as much as I can. What do we do, well we have philanthropy events, weekly meeting, a set of rules and standards that govern us, and a lot of fun events as well. When you switch from that standpoint it really makes a difference. The comment that stuck with me the most was “if you hire people just because they can do a job, they’ll work for your money, but if you hire someone who believes what you believe they work for you with blood sweat and tears” As I go out in to the real world I want to work for someone who inspires me, and I want to recruit girls who will inspire me and others.\n",
      "This speech really made me open my eyes to what makes us as humans think and behave. The Golden Circle really is the main aspect of leaders and action focusing on what, how, and why. However, it is interesting to see how individuals and companies are viewing it all wrong. By watching this video it is biologically correct that we explain WHY we do something before the how and what. In the speech Sinek talks about the neocortex of the brain as well as the limbic part of the brain. The neocortex handles rational thinking and the what aspect of the golden circle. The limbic portion focuses on feeling and behavior- what drives people. In this area is where the why and how of the golden circle come into play. If you are able to inspire someone on the WHY aspect of a product or believe they will follow that behavior not because they feel like they are obligated, because they it is now what they too believe in. I really liked the quote \"People don't buy what you do but how you do it\". This can correlate to one of the last topics that Sinek speaks on Martin Luther King Jr. His speeches were not based on what plans he had on change, his speeches where based on how he believed, which in turn made much of the nation believe that way too. Overall, starting with why instead of what is what is biologically correct for success within the human population.\n",
      "Human makes decisions and takes actions driven by emotions. Our frontal lobe rationalize the decision. It means emotion is the strongest trigger we never resist. Emotion is stimulated by visions. I interpreted that \"Why\", \"Belief\" which he said in this video means vision. If I have a opportunity to tell my goal. I will tell about my vision which I do achieve in my life.\n",
      "This is the most inspiring speech I have ever seen!! It makes inspired every time I watched this video. As a speaker, he is so natural. He doesn't have to fake anything to make people buy anything from him. He is just right in front your face!\n"
