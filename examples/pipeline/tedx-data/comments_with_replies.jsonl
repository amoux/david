If you want to blame something blame \"Wikipedia\" because those or any encyclopedia are always editing...... and telling you and educating on what you have to believe and trust..... There is an easier solution just blame the french or the polish or maybe the Italians so you don't have to travel to Jerusalem and sack the Jews just for the sake of your sick amusement. Why are they even telling me history in school? Why do you need to teach geography? Just keep sending Americans to slovakia and allow the slavics to torture them and feed the remains to their pets.

Probably less than he had trying to live the idealistic \"normal\" life he would never achieve.

Indeed a person with such obvious substance, having the capacity and will to share their feelings, doubtless inspired by this outstanding, exemplary young man. People such as yourself who are so motivated, caring and insightful, bear absolutely no resemblance, or have any points in common with the person you describe, being yourself. Forgive me if I sound at all cliche, life and all it's problematic twists and turns, or sometimes prolonged periods of involuntary downtime should be judged by its overall quality and not by it's length.

I too wrestle with certain possibilities and being a practical man coming to terms with my own experiences proved very difficult.  I can't nor would I try to convince you because you have to have your own experience.  Word alone is not enough, even if you did experience something you might think you're in need of medication.\n\n\nI am not talking psychics or spiritual meetings, I can only tell you of my parent's experiences.  My father died in 1973 but six weeks before he told my mother his sister Amy came to him.  she sat down on the bed just before father left the bedroom and told him it was time for him to prepare for his passing.  She made two visits.  After my father passed away it was mid-1984 whilst my mother was watching television when she saw my father sat opposite her.\n\n\nshe thought she was losing her mind and left the room.  She returned with a cup of tea but father was still there.  This continued for the next eighteen months every two months or so, my mother passed away in 1986.  My sister received visitations from our mother apparently to let her know she was alright, I never received any such visits.\n\n\nI cannot prove or disprove these claims, but when I was stationed in Germany I was on duty on my own when I had a number of experiences that were beyond explanation.  However, I ventured to mention to fellow troop members what had happened and was told, \"why do you think duty was taken in the guardroom\".  I have no explanation as to what happened, but suffice it say, it was not pleasant.  This probably proves nothing to you as it's just my word, but I know what I saw and I would not try to convince you one way or the other.  Justin.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Justin Case"}

By you saying \"disabled\" you're not telling us EXACTLY what he has, so you're basically saying \"all disabled people should live as long as they should\", which is not true, and is completely selfish to say. Sure you'll cry, but at least they're not suffering anymore, right? Obviously this isn't saying autism or down syndrome, because they're the least dangerous of all disabilities, as in, the life expectancies aren't 13 like Progeria. I absolutely hate ignorance coming from parent's because they only want their child to live so they don't have to go through grieving over their child. Certain disabilities effect how a child will live, and hoping their child lives and not understanding what they're going through is nuts. They may say they're doing good, but deep down they're suffering and only time will tell. :)", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SS Shadow"}

Striving to live in a world which doesn‚Äôt experience the pain that they go through, is what we can do. Hoping for a brighter and more beautiful future is what we owe them, and ourselves. They teach us that as able bodied humans we can do everything that they try to, without anywhere near the amount of difficulty that they experience. While we sit around feeling sorry for ourselves, there‚Äôs a disabled kid wiping away their tears while moving forward with a task that‚Äôs seemingly impossible.

That's because majority of converts find Islam a more motivational region. If you don't know anything about Islam, don't say it. Don't act like you have read the whole Quran or something. I barely think you guys have at least read a page of it. Respect others religions. There's bad in every religion, so no religion has perfect people. Don't act like Christians and Hindus are all kind and respectful. Heard of Donald trump who wants to ban Muslims from US and against it? Yeah. Heard of some Indian gurus who want to kill Muslims? Yeah.\nBasically some people just want to attack Muslims. See, who are being \"terrorists\" here? Okay, I have heard about Bashr al Assad too. See? Every religion has bad people, and no one is perfect.\nBonus- for Christians, the Holy trinity consists of three people-Jesus,(son of God) , Holy Spirit and God.\nYou know who is said to be the \"God\"? Allah. Yep, that's right. He is the one who Muslims worship. Quran and Bible have such a similar connection, the language is different and a few things.

It's good AND not good to be immortal for a few reasons:\n\nThe downsides\n1. When you keep aging, your parents and friends will pass away and you won't be able to see them anymore.\n2. Eventually there will be future disasters leading to the Earth, possibly if more asteroids, meteorites, or other things come from space.\n3. If he was immortal, he'd have to be here for World War III or possibly World War IV. \n4. If I was him, I'd just like to live up to 2100 or 2200, to see how much we've succeeded since the 20th and 21st century. I would not want to go to the 24th century. \n5. You literally will be alive forever, that means you live for quintillions of years... If humanity goes extinct, you'll be the last one.\n\nThe upsides\n1. If you're immortal, you can live through anything. You can fall 1000 feet and even survive, you can live through a gunshot, etc.\n2. You'll be here to witness the first official contact between humans and aliens. That will change humanity forever, it's going to be a big impact on history.\n3. I already said this once, but you're technically invincible... If a meteorite crashed onto you, you'd survive. You can't feel pain anymore.\n4. You get to see how much our world has improved; 1900s-2100.\n5. See humanity spread across the stars, if we'll be able to colonize on Mars or possibly the Moon. \n6. You won't have to witness death.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Mario"}

Ofc we should support him and help him, pray for him etc. but we should also make him feel human and treat him as we would treat a friend. \n\nHe must get sick and tired of all the 'oh it must be so difficult' 'oh im so sorry for you'. It's complicated and my argument is very much flawed i agree. I think emotion just got the better of me when i was writing that comment. \n\nBottom line is, yes we should shown him empathy and have sympathy. But also important is to treat him like a normal person and normal human being because that may be most important to him. I realise he has passed, but the amount he has achieved in his lifetime is way more than >90% of the worlds population so he can feel very proud of himself wherever he is now.

I¬¥m not saying that it is good as a joke, but that it is way better than all the people here making others sad and feel bad.

It uses qualitative words; \"fuller\", \"happier\" cannot be measured quantitatively. \"Longer\" is a quantitative word; 10 cm is longer than 5 cm, 5 years is longer than 4 years, etc., and to suggest that you can use the word metaphorically defies all logic and English convention.\n\nNow, you can say \"it's as if he lived longer\", or any supporting qualitative phrases to support the statement.\n\nIt's like saying \"the marathon is 5km long, yet it was longer than 10km\". Doesn't make sense. It would make sense to say \"the marathon is 5km long, but it feels as if it's longer than 10km\". \n\nAnd yes, we all know what the original poster was trying to say. But please, don't defend improper English.

Oh by the way, this young man is no longer alive.\n\nI believe many people liked his video (Do you really think that the act of liking someone's video is equivalent to putting them on a pedestal? C'mon man.) because in spite of the challenges that he faced, he still was able to accomplish some of his dreams and keep a positive attitude most of the time. This is something that everyone should try to do but unfortunately many people just give up when times get tough. So think of liking the video or giving it a thumbs up as an applause to the young man's efforts.\n\nI would also like or give thumbs up to videos of anyone else who would talk about how they overcame struggles \"much worse\" (Much worse is an extremely subjective comment.) than his. I believe positive reinforcement of inspiring testimonies is a good thing to do for the betterment of all mankind. Take care.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "sessahme"}

{"cid": "UgimA0pxiKV2EXgCoAEC.8LebrNEhaij8O0ewJItbd3", "text": "I know it was an exaggeration, and I used the word in that spirit.\n\nMy \"theory\" (I wouldn't call it that) is based on the fact that I do not believe in the existence of free (FREE) will. I believe in causality, as that is what we observe in the world (a specific cause always brings about one specific result), and I believe that the workings of human brain are no exception to causality. So, I believe that a human behavior is exactly determined by causality; a combination of genetics (\"hardware\") and it's interaction with it's surroundings, which it doesn't a priori choose and which produces all that is not initially present, except the most basic things (\"software\"). Of course, at a certain point in time, a conscious choice appears, which further influences what \"outside influences\" the brain comes into contact with and thus how it develops further, but all those choices are built in a prior basis which we do not freely choose, and thus consequently we have no REAL freedom in this development.\n\nAs Arthur Schopenhauer said, \"A man can do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills.\". And as Gustav Meyrink said it one of his stories: \"See, you cannot 'want'. There are wishes beyond your will, some of which you know and some which you don't. And both are stronger than you.\"\n\nFor these reasons, I do not believe in the existence of something that you could call \"ultimate, objective moral responsibility\", because I believe that ultimately, there is no true choice. I believe we are, in fact, just witnesses of what happens, because nothing else than what will happen could possibly happen.\n\nPossibly, if the brain somewhat worked on a quantum basis (if it made use of the state of superposition somehow in decision making), then that would refute this kind of determinism, but I don't think we know that's the case yet. And still, if the result of superposition was \"truly random\" (not just statistically random), I am not sure that it would prove \"free will\" in the classical sense - as randomness would probably not be considered a manifestation of \"free will\" by most people.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Luk√°≈° Dohnal"}

Casualty doesn't account for memetic transferrence of these concepts, as that would imply that the words that I am typing and the words that you hear are nothing more than a complex hardwritten cue not open to interpretation for you to go about solely one action.\"\n\nYou seem to assume that the brain's functioning is excerpt from the law of causality. I do not, which is why I don't see any contradiction. IMHO, when the brain perceives a symbol of communication such as a word or a sentence, it assigns meaning to them, but not randomly; the assigned meaning is determined by objective factors, like for example prior knowledge or IQ (simplified example, not saying that IQ is or isn't an accurate measure of \"intelligence\"). ... Since a huge amount of functioning of the brain takes place at sub-conscious level, we are not aware of all the causal processes that lead us to interpret a certain word in this way or that way, but I still consider it \"safer\" to assume that there are causal processes, like we observe in 99% of the workings of this universe (the 1% is not necessarily non-causal, but we are currently unable to determine the causes and make reliable predictions), than to assume that just because we don't yet understand the intricacies of inner workings of a certain system, the system is probably non-causal (or even that there is something like \"free will\", which is a problematic term on it's own, due to the fact that it is not a coherent and clearly defined concept).\n\nBy the way - in essence, not just words, but pretty much anything that we perceive with the senses is a symbol. What we see may not at all be the \"true objective form\" of the given object, but merely a symbolic representation of it that is possible for our senses to grasp, and which tells us how we are \"supposed to\" behave (or rather, it tells us what will probably happen if we chose this action or that action). Because an information does not have to be necessarily \"true\" (even if there was something like \"objective truth\") in order to bring about the desired result.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Luk√°≈° Dohnal"}

And if you can't see that, it's your problem. Because I look at someone with a disability and that disability is apparent to me does not make me a bad person. It makes me realistic. There is nothing noble about ignoring such an obvious handicap. There is something to be said however, for seeing a handicap and then being able to look past it and seeing that how an individual handles their handicap so well and so optimistically absolutely adds to the inspiration, not detracts from it. The fact that I can look at him as an entire individual, as a whole, disability and all, is not a fault. It's part of what makes him who he is. And though it's not the only part, not by a long shot, I would venture to say it's a pretty damn big part.  Secondly, he would be inspiring even without the disability. The kid is 17 and speaks with the intelligence and eloquence of someone twice his age or older. His maturity and world view are admirable qualities. So get off your high horse and don't make insinuations about why I would consider him an inspiration, when the truth is you don't have the vaguest notion as to what I find inspiring about this young man.

It just annoyed me because people don't compare his maturity to a general population and instead say he's mature because of a disability.

Il place n example one of many....Im 24 i make a decent living as a journeyman  but i feel its not enough to get by...im a virgin who doesnt  go out much due to finance. If i ever talk to a girl i cant tell wether or not they are being friendly or hitting on me so i dont feel its appropriate to touch or make a move on them i feel thats harrassement (again fear driven).  I fear even if a girl liked me i could never give her what she deserves so shes better finding someone who can again finance. When it comes to children i dont feel its fair to bring children into this world i cant financially fend for n give a good life unlike the unhappy one iv been living basing it all off finance( again fear). Again though im numb to the idea because i cant tell wether a girl is being friendly or hitting on me so i dont form an opinion that she may or may not be interested me which is upsetting because end of the day itd be nice to at least be friends with girls but i find it hard because of the physically attraction i have towards them so again out of fear id never feel its appropriate to ask a girl to chill iv chilled with girls before gone out but thats because they asked but again i learned from experience when i thought they were interested they were infact just being mentally n physically friendly n didnt mean anything by it (not to mean i was a lil bitch being clingy n told em i was interested in them.... just making physical contact sexually but not actual sex) led me on as to what  i thought they might have been interested just to learn their just being friendly so thats one example maybe i am depressed trying to convince myself but i have a lot of hope", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Budder Waxes"}

Realistically the Worlds country's CO2 forthcoming targets from the Paris conference will be something of a challenge to say the least.Regarding methane it is assumed that in the worst case, with a steady warming of the ocean of 3 degrees Celsius, around 85 per cent of the methane trapped in the sea floor could be released into the water column. Other, more sensitive models predict that methane hydrates at great water depths are not threatened by warming. According to these models, only the methane hydrates that are located directly at the boundaries of the stability zones would be primarily affected. At these locations, a temperature increase of only 1 degree ¬≠Celsius would be sufficient to release large amounts of methane from the hydrates. The methane hydrates in the open ocean at around 500 meters of water depth, and deposits in the shallow regions of the Arctic would mainly be affected.(World ocean review) Whats on my mind is the Worlds food security.? ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "The Voodoos"}

Personally, I want to worship Him for an eternity, but if you don't then that is entirely your choice and you can die in hell. I wish you wouldn't, God wishes you wouldn't (but He will let you because free will is one of His gifts and He wants actual love, not coerced love), millions of Christians wish you wouldn't, all the Saints wish you wouldn't, but you seem pretty stubborn. Just know that I used to have the exact same opinion as you (rather face eternal torment than spend eternity with Somebody who would let bad things happen), but it changed quickly after even minor research into theology.

In my opinion having emotional crutches is a bad thing for both you and your 'crutches'. For you it's bad because one day inevitably they will disappear and you will collapse. And for your 'cruthes' in the face of family and friends it's bad because you USE them for your wellbeing. You just uncosciously assign certain duties to those people and you expect from them to take care of you. It's a two-way manipulation process which leads to nowhere. And on the Jehovah issue, I don't believe in any humanlike creature sitting somewhere creating universes and looking after 1 000 0000 00 0 00 00 00 0 00 000 0 00000 living creatures on earth with equal attention and love. What you call as God is the force of nature which I agree with you is absolutely self-sufficient and humans can only dream of state like this. I am talking of emotional self-sufficiency. Of course you are dependent on water, air, food, environment and many more factors which 'God' has transcended, but inner state of happiness should be 100% your responsibility and not delegated to 5 people around you.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Georgi Georgiev"}

Perhaps you're right about Islam, I don't know, I haven't studied the Qur'an or its teachings and you clearly have since you obviously know it well enough to criticize it. But the message I was trying to convey is, whether Islam is good or bad, its followers do not engage in sexual intercourse with goats. That is a stereotype and a pointless mislead that distracts from the issue. If there's enough grounds to criticize Islam based on what it's actually about then why introduce a point that has nothing to do with that? It'll just confuse the issue.\n     Also, even if a person's religion is destructive, try not to hold it against them. Trust me when I say that it can be really hard to leave something like that, even if it is making you worse as a person, especially if you've never known anything else.\n     I share these things not because I want to sound smart on the Internet, but because I want to have a discussion that will hopefully allow both of us to see this topic through different perspectives.

There was two interesting consequences of that : 1) after that it was guys like YOU , who made big complains and bad critizm about the comedian... 2) the comedian get emails from blind people ( i mean people who cant see) , and they say to the comedian : 'please put in your next show also jokes about us' ...\nI know, thats hard to understand for you, but to not make jokes about a minority IS ALSO a kind of discrimination, because : with that behavior YOU ampute this people from society .. because its a part of society to laugh with eachother , about eachother - and to oversaturate things (you heard about 'big bang theory' the show ? thats also a kind of oversaturating nerds... its clear that in real life THOSE kind of nerds DONT exist)...\nAlso Sascha Baron Cohen once was critized from guys like you because of his 'Borat'-character. They mean to him : 'Its an insult against kasachstan people..Borat let people know how stupid and non-evolved kasachstan people are' ... Wanna know how Sascha Cohen answered ? He answered: 'It only shows the stupidity of the people who THINKS that Borat represents Kasachstan people'\nThats a hard answer, and i dont want to mean it to you in our case...\nBut i think you know what i mean....\nThere is a difference : wether i make jokes about a minority about their condition , behaviors, etc ... OR i make jokes TO take away the human value of a human being. The difference is subtil, but its recognizable... and i give you a kind of roadmap how you can see the difference. For example, if i would say about this human being : 'Burn it with fire, before it lays eggs' .. thats not ok... also when i say things which shows a 'difference in human value' ...for example : 'use this creature for medical experiments' etc... Thats all things which are truely not ok and discrimination, even if someone wants it defend as 'funny' -because its clearly to see: that the reason why someone said such things weren't to be funny - it was there to try take away human value of a human being.\nAlso if someone would gather a bunch of people, just to laugh about one - thats mobbing/bulling ..also in that case the 'one' isnt integrated - he is seperated from the social group...\n\nIn our case: he was integrated. He knows about his condition, he knows that he looks in a different way... as long he is integrated in the society in the way : how he is, and how he looks (and that doesnt mean necessarly that 'everyone have to see optical beauty in him' - it means: as long he is valued how he is, as human beeing , there could no problem with it, to make jokes about outstanding impressions about him)... In the same way that also other public persons have no problem with it... there are a lot of impersonations by comedians from g.w.bush, al pacino, george freeman, etc (just look to frank caliendo ;) ). They all also can say : 'now im hurt' , but they didnt , because it isnt meant in a insulting way (they understand the difference). But with your logic, they also could be butthurt.\n\nAnd that makes the difference... with our sense of humor, we integrated this guy in the video in our social life. He had the balls to make himself public - not with a mask - but how he is. He dont hide his appearence , and was prepared for all the reactions.. and what people make about his step to the public. It was very brave... and unfortunately he isnt alive anymore - but i think he also would smile about 'sloth from the goonies' jokes... in the same way that for sure G.W.Bush smiles about impersonations when frank Caliendo shows a 'dumb bush'... I'm sure, Caliendo still has big respect to Bush. Its all about: how someone mean a joke, and not : which joke someone makes about the other.\nAnd like i say with the stand-up-comedian before: the interesting thing is: no amputed people had make complain about the ampute-jokes...the people who critized the comedian were people who had both legs, and didnt know: if its really hurted the people with no legs or not.\n\nI know, you mean it in a good way.. I know you said your message because you care about minorities. I appreciate that..¬† But as i say: there is a difference how someone mean a joke, or wether he just try to take away human value from a human being....", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "PygmalionFaciebat"}

And quite frankly, its always been like this. This probably makes you feel better degrading someone else right?. Guess what though? You are wasting your time. You need to get your lazy broke ass off of your computer and go do something with your life. Go be productive. Insulting people who are better than you, (YES, THIS \"ALIEN\" IS BETTER THAN YOU) is such a waste of time man. You can talk all this shit but where will it lead you? You'll just be perceived as an uneducated immature douchebag that wastes time on social media. I wasn't going to waste my finger muscle on you when scrolling down the comments of this video , but after reading several of your comments, i changed my mind. Seeing that everyone else is inclined to calling you all these names and rude and whatnot , I personally think that it just fuels your actions. (obviously right?) But I got some downtime right about now, so i figure its a perfect time to get your attention. Bottom line bro, is that this dude Sam, is awesome . I somewhat knew a little bit about his story, and watching this video was a good therapy for me, and it should be as well for you. Just do everyone a favor and try to raise your self-esteem on a porn-site or facebook or twitter or instagram, somewhere else where its not actually MATERIAL THAT MATTERS like this video . I dont wish anything bad on you because it would just be, like i said, a waste of energy. Hopefully you take a little of what i am conveying to you AT LEAST with a grain of salt, maybe one day changing you for the better. Oh ! and by the way, what makes this guy better than you is that he loved his life. You dont clearly. Because if you did, you'd appreciate all the men and women that stick up for you and try to make this place a better place to live. You can do whatever the fuck you want in this life.

Before I comment though, I wanted to recomment on why I compared \"the existence of ET's\" with (belief of) the \"existence of God\". I agree, hindsight being 20/20, that it was an unfair comparison because it didn't explain my reasoning behind it. My reasoning was that both sides (Atheists) and (Christians) see each idea as irrational, illogical, etc. Also the big difference between Christians and Atheists, is that Atheism look at most everything based on facts. Everything has to make sense and be proved by fact. (This is per my personal observation, please feel free to correct me!) Christianity, on the other hand is a combination of:\n1. Facts that take a little faith:\nIf you think about it, these type of facts are in almost every part of life. Like how someone would know for a fact that their friend for example, is innocent of a crime based on a series of \"circumstantial evidence\" and well they know that person, even if the friend doesn't have a rock solid case. I know God exist because I can feel his presence when I'm praying to him.This to me is evidence. Circumstantial, but evidence all the same.¬†\n2. Relationship:\nThis is the main factor that differs Christianity from Atheism. One can not believe in Christ (and God are one in the same), without wanting and engaging in a relationship with their all mighty father. Believe it or not, but that relationship is actually a lot more than just talking to an empty room on your knees with your hands folded. If we truly are willing to listen, our Father can and will speak back to us. It just may not always be in a \"talking through a burning bush\" or a \"water to wine\" kind of way. Sometimes, when we pray we are quick to blame God when we do not get the \"perfect response\" right away.¬†", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Lollipoper42"}

I used to say the same things you do.   But eventually,  those of us who actually do use the brains that \"god gave us\".... and question things,  start to see things very differently.  The evidence you speak of is not evidence at all....  \"feelings\" and \"personal experiences\" are evidence to you and you alone.  What good are they to someone else who can't feel or experience them, no matter how earnestly they try and desire to?  And to the many ex-christians such as myself who did \"feel\" and \"experience\" those things...  it's very easy to look back with \"rational eyes\" and see that yes they were \"real\" feelings and experiences, but they were \"created\" by us, internally.  There is no \"god\" necessary for delusion,  us humans are great at creating our delusions all on our own.\n\nRegarding prayer and communication with our \"father\"....  any honest christian will come to realize over time that this is non existent.  The warm fuzzy feelings,  and the things that you THINK god is saying to you... is all you,  created in your brain,  by you,  but crediting it to god because that's what you want to believe.  When you pray for something and you don't get it.... it's ok,  it's not gods fault,  it's not HIS timing.... or he doesn't WANT me to have it so he can \"teach\" me something.... or he's \"testing\" me.... etc etc.  He always has an excuse (that you give him).   On the RARE time you get it...  it's something that may well have happened without god (ie. it was not a miracle).... but you are happy to give all the \"glory\" to god anyway.   Prayer is a scam.   There was even a scientific study done where they compared the outcome of people with cancer being healed.... one group was prayed for by sincere christians.... the other group was not prayed for.   This was a genuine study done with a large number of subjects.  The result.... no difference.   This is one of the MAJOR reasons christians lose their faith,  because over time they come to realize that prayer does nothing, makes no difference to outcomes,  and people get sick and tired of NOT \"hearing\" back from god in any kind of clear and certain way.  Forget about a \"perfect\" response as you say.... how about ANY response that you can know (not just think, hope, or believe, but KNOW is) clearly and certainly is from god.  It doesn't happen.

Just like if you were talking with a friend, sometimes you don't like the response they give. It is the same with God. Except this time, responses are be hidden in \"His word\" for example, or \"The Holy Spirit\". Waiting to be discovered by hearts that are genuine and open to change.  CBN's Seven Keys to Hearing God by Craig von Buseck, is a really great article for the subject. He says \"The most difficult part of hearing God is the fact that it takes time to learn to discern God's voice -- and it takes a humble heart. Jeremiah 29:12-13 says, 'Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart'.\" Honestly, I'm afraid that may be the problem you mentioned, \"instead the person praying will get no response -- or an occasional vague \"feeling\" or \"sign\" which he \"interprets\" (thinks, wishes, hopes) is from god\". \nWhether or not you are including yourself in the scenario you stated, I've found that the reason people aren't \"hearing\" God is because they may not be seeking God with humble hearts. Please let me clarify. I am not saying that these people aren't genuinely seeking God._ What I am saying is that they may be are seeking out God for the wrong reasons. Some may be praying simply to feel good about themselves, something has been off the to-do list. Another reason, communication is breached, is because people often seem to have the need to to test God. However, there is no fooling him. I have a question for you. Would there ever have been a \"reasonable response\" from God that would satisfy you? Even if God spoke out as clear as someone else talking, Satan would masterfully convince you that it was all in your head and it wasn't God. So I ask isn't it possible that the question isn't whether or not God exists, but whether or not you really gave him a real chance?\nYou might be asking yourself, \"Why are his responses hidden\"? God camouflages his answers from those who don't intend on listening to his answers.\n2. I just want to reassure you that I always took into account the fact that you were once Christian. I just know that even though you still have the physical knowledge from your Christian days, your point of view on them has drastically changeed to the point that you fufilled Ephesians 4:18, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart\" \n3. You've made an incorrect assumtion about Christians here; \"The non-rational christians won't question anything\". Maybe that is how you lived out your \"Christian life\"  but I honestly don't know anyone who hasn't asked questions. However, I don't mean \"questioning their faith. I mean asking questions, like How? What? Where? When in study with the Word. That's why when you look at a bible, it's marked up because that person spent time, daring to ask questions.

If you want to continue in a rational manner i'm happy to continue,  but i'm not the slightest bit interested in psycho babble or scripture that is utterly invalid and irrelevant.\n\nA quick comment on faith,  as you mentioned it a few times in your last comment.  Faith is simply believing without evidence or proof.  Now if you tell me you have a dog,  i can believe you on faith,  because i know dogs exist and many people have dogs.  But if you tell me you have a flying talking dog....  i would need a whole lot of evidence before i believed it.  I would not believe on faith,  and most people would agree i would be stupid if i did.  If i did...  such faith would be no more than mere gullibility.  This is why every religious person is gullible (just as i was),  as they believe a fairy tale as fact", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "podoz"}

ILoveGaming Well said. when we read comments though, i think we're ignoring a couple of things. first of all, people only comment if they feel that they should. when we see someone like sam, it opens up a bit of emotions that urges us to say something. when we see someone normal, there isn't much point complimenting them since we assume they get complimented enough already (maybe i don't know the exact reason here), but most of us just say nothing at all because we don't have an urge to. other people tend to post negative comments towards normal people for various reasons; jealousy, criticism, they're annoyed, etc. These emotions can be strong once they're triggered, so the urge to post negative comments is must stronger for those people than for the people who would have posted a compliment. So now we have a comment section full of people posting nasty things, and no one is saying anything nice, and you're left with the impression that no one actually likes this guy. But that's a false representation of how people really feel. most of the time when you look at the amount of comments, and the number of views, its about a 1/10 ratio, this video is close to 1/100. That means every time one person writes a negative comment, 10-100 people did not feel that strongly about the video. Again, usually it takes more effort to be impressed than it does to find fault. So no comments may actually be a good thing. \n\nAlso, try to remember that there are kids of all ages that post here. Sometimes when you watch entertainment videos, you'll find tons of kids posting in the comment section. They're dumb and they don't know what they're saying, and you have no good way of knowing how old anyone here is. \n\nSometimes i feel like Randy from My Name is Earl.

The hypothesis I came up with follows the logic of non-existence and coming into existence. Logically speaking, time has to have a beginning, otherwise we wouldn't reach this point, or the other possibility is that we could've always existed outside of time, but time also has to have a beginning for us to exist in any case. And in \"us\" I refer to our consciousness. So, we can only experience existence, so for us, existence is the only thing we know. So either we always existed outside of time and we cannot remember, or we came into existence, from non-existence.\nIn the case of non-existence and entering existence, it means there was a chance for this to happen, a combination of elements in the universe, multiverse, or whatever it might be. And by logic, if we do exit existence once our body is biologically \"dead\", there is the same chance of entering existence again, perhaps the only thing preventing us entering existence at any point is that we already exist so it doesn't make logical sense. And if this isn't the case, then it can be any other hypothesis in which we exist anyway.¬†\n\nSo, developing scenarios like this and deducting things about them by logic alone, I came up with a few possible cases. And in each case I actually am ok with them. Death now doesn't scare me as before I thought about these things. Mind you, I was actually depressed about my own mortality, now I am totally ok with it.¬†\n\nI don't know if it has value or not for others, but for me it makes sense, and at least it gives me peace of mind and all that.\n\nThe reason I didn't wanted to go in detail is because it's allot to talk about, and I didn't even said everything I came up with, I thought about this for a long, long time, and I discussed this with my best friend, an engineer, and programmer, and he added a few things and confirmed the logic behind it.

For example, i dont feel pity and sorrow and become sad and mellow for handicapped people (in wheelchairs for example), because i can read them - they hate it. I have respect for them, but pity - no.

It's the fact that he will die soon (or he died). As you said - He is aware of it. And all people in comments bashing you simply cannot see full picture. His life time is predestined, and no matter what he does or how many drums he plays, it wont change it. People are 'programmed' to feel pity for a person who is one step in the grave.

If a ten year old kid went through an uncountable number of traumatic and unusual events and an 80 year old lived their entire life without really ever doing or thinking about anything, which do you think would have more wisdom? And if you're still certain that younger people can't really be that wise, then do some research into the childhood of the last Dalai Lama. If you STILL don't think that its possible at that point, then its you who is really in denial.

Someone could just be depressed and I'd feel for them. Doesn't mean I've never seen true suffering, cause, honestly, you're right. There are people in unimaginable poverty, pain, and just overall bad places. Ive seen it. Ive been to island nations and I was nearly beaten for my money. Luckily, it never came to that, but it happened. Ive seen horrible pain, and so have you. Hell, ive seen a man die from typhus while on a mission trip. You probablt saw even WORSE. But that doesn't make other people's situations good or nothing to worry about. You might believe that all humans are selfish, but I don't think that's true. I think that if people have fought to defend their families, like in the 3rd world countries of the world, that they are thinking more about the well being of their family. And, I'm happy that you worked hard and moved to the States. And I find it honorable that you still send money to your family. You have seen suffering, but that doesn't mean that other people don't struggle. There is a saying that people have been using for a long time: \" Pain is relative\". If someone grew up impoverished, then they suffered. But if someone grew up with a life threatening disability in the States, then that is a huge thing for them. Just like I said before, just cause some people have it worse, doesn't mean that this isn't bad. And you might never change, your view point may stay narrow, but I hope I broadened your horizon. I'm not gonna respond to you anymore cause you're too stubborn to back down and I'm done messing with it. But I hope that you could visit a church some time, I think you could really use the experience. I'd love to talk to you in person some time so we could have a reasonable discussion, rather than contribute to a youtube flame war. ", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Wrolnick 3"}

I honor your sadness about your cousin passing away. Don't forget how happy your cousin made you, you can keep that memory with you always and carry it around with you to cheer you up on gloomy days. As you remember your cousin, you can play a song like You Were There by Babyface to celebrate your cousin being in your life and loving you. :) It's a song honoring a friend that Babyface had who died. He's so glad to have known this friend so it is a wonderful song dedicated to their beautiful friendship. :) Please listen to it and tell me what you think. :)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lemur Lover"}

If we take emotion out of the equation and just look at it purely objectively in a \"how do we best preserve the species\" approach then it's an interesting question.¬†\n\n\nOne thing that makes us stand out above all other animals is our ability of self-awareness. We are aware of not only the survival of ourselves but also of each other. Purely objectively I think the best course of action would be to preserve the life of everyone possible, unless preserving the life of one person would cause harm to others (in cases of murder, rape, etc) or destruction of our knowledge/technology. By preserving his life not only would he live, but we might also learn new things about Progeria and possibly advance our understanding about medicine as a whole.\n\n\nThe fact that we are even discussing how to best preserve our species survival is an even more impressive feat. Our ability to communicate with one another and transfer knowledge to each other makes us almost like a single mega-organism. At this point, we are the fittest.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "David2278"}

The sort of douchebag who doesn't have a real opinion on anything, but simple waits for a consensus to emerge so they can be on the opposite side of it and project \"uniqueness\". The types of people who always change their favorite movie/band/book, because they suspect their favorite movie/band/book is \"becoming too popular\". The same people who always make sure to \"prefer\" a director's more obscure, less mainstream films. Their fear is ever having to acknowledge they're average\n\n2) Compensating for an inferiority complex Douches. The douchebags who like to think of themselves as the ones who see through the bullshit others cannot, whom desperately try to poke holes in something to discredit it if it means something to another. these sort of douchebags have a pavlovian response to tear down any offered inspirational story. In truth, they're simply bitter, unaccomplished people who want to strip anyone else of credit, joy.....this is what motivates them. 17 year-old staring death in the face and still finding meaning in life?-- \"\"Big whoop, he's simply saying basic motivational stuff anyone could say, he just gets attention because he's dying\"\" (overlooking the fact that depth has always been linked to context for any inspiring speech/talk...and his rapidly approaching death is most certainly a meaningful context to his words and wisdom). Their fear is that others will recognize not that they merely aren't average, but that they are, in fact, disappointments.\n\n3) Pathological Liars. People so afraid of ever revealing a genuine human part of themselves to someone, that they take pretend positions that a genuine person would never take, or be able to understand. It's a way of being in a social realm, but still shielding yourself from the terror of anyone having to know the real pathetic you. By annoying and pissing people off, it makes them feel powerful, in control...makes the fact that they're genuinely cowards feel less emasculating. Basically the psychology of 99% of internet trolls. Their fear is that if they ever be themselves, that nobody would ever pay attention to them.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Dane Potmo"}

In my case, i'm the combination of all the categories over 9000. I've achieved this hard task by mastering many of the trolling tools available... but mostly three of them. I'll call them the \"tour de force of teh interwebz\":\n\n1) Doing it all for the lulz :our highest glory is to achieve a transubstantial state of LMAO-ROFL-TROLOLOL.\n2) If it exists on the internet, it CAN and it MUST be shitted on : 10/10 i'll buy 100 kthx.  \n3) Trolling is a vital part to sustain balance, along with the srs bsns : the cake is a lie... but what if it's true?\n\nOur duty is to provide the rest of the world with a starting point to compare between good st0ff and bad st00000ff. Everybody likes the keyboard hero who posts a good comment about love, peace and how Jesus saved his family from anal cancer.\n\n... Ok, the anal cancer picture won't show on the screen. Whatever, lets do go on...\n\nHow could you treasure teh interwebz good deeds, if there was no nutjob/shitprick/titfucking comments around? Thanks to our important labour, boosted by energy drinks, doritos and basement dwelling... we give enough reasons for everyone \"normal\" (Orly?) to believe they're doing the right things. And don't worry: we will endure the comebacks/exposures/bans. We've bled for it and we would die for it. Believe me, brothers. \n\nWith his honest smile, a Cockmongler once told me, \"There can't be light without darkness, nor virtue without goatses\".\n\nLet us be the goatses of the past, present and future.

So everyone who commits hatred and anger against others, and even the good people in our world, only did these things because of the conditions they grew up in. They were given a genetic DNA base, and then an environment to develop, and because of these things, they make the decisions they do. Everyone including you and me, the fact that I'm talking to you right now is because I love discussion and have a yearning for truth and a passion for life. If I didn't have all of these things, I would probably be doing something else right now, and that means that I didn't choose it. What makes us who we are is simply our choices our brains make due to our nature and the environment we lived through. If you want to see evidence for this, watch Sam Harris' video on free will, it's about 45 minutes long and he gives his logical case against it.\n\nNow what this means is that nobody is at fault for their mistakes, nobody was the cause of their successes. The things that they did because of what happened to them is ultimately the only thing that made them who they are. We kind of go through everyday life assuming this isn't true just for simplicity's sake; but we should be very careful to understand that this isn't at all ACTUALLY true. If you had been born as Ted Bundy, had the same exact childhood, the same life experiences as he did, and the same things happened to you, you would have done the same exact things, including those horrific murders. You would have BEEN Ted Bundy.\n\nSo I do not believe in punishment solely for the sake of punishment, never will I believe in that as long as I reject the idea of free will as most people conceive it.\n\nKeep that in mind if you truly are thinking about committing murders, sure it may feel justified, but all you are doing is selfishly taking your own rage against society out on innocent people, who may or may not be ignorant evil people, but even if they were, death solely for punishment isn't just. So if you are at all a moral person, you would understand what you yourself said, \"You can't fight fire with fire.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "ghostsade3"}

After a lot of thinking about life and god and how it all must have been put together, I finally figured that since a human (and any other animals too) don't choose their DNA, and doesn't choose their environment. Therefore, you don't make any choices. That's why I hate god. For giving me such a awful life.\n\nI know, nobody is at fault for their mistakes. STILL we punish people. I actually thought of it today, how wrong it is to punish other people for what they do. People are animals. Would you punish a dog for barking? No, I thought so. What we should do, is help people live with their disadvantages without bothering others. But then I have a question. How about the ones that never understands? Shall we just let them run around and keep doing wrong (I know there is nothing that is wrong and nothing that is right tho) things all their life?

{"cid": "UgjcHPBCfrhnZngCoAEC.80SxynajR3M72ZSUz4Qctk", "text": "@Peter Grimstad It's good that you understand that free will is an illusion. But I must ask you, why do you believe in a god? And what god specifically? What are the qualities of this god? I do not believe in gods, so I have to ask you why you do, as I believe them to be fairy tales humans made up because humans NEED an answer to a question (\"How did we get here?\", \"Why are we here?\". \"Who are we here for?\". \"Who/what made us?\").\n\nBecause I don't believe in a god, it's impossible for me to blame a deity for my bad situation in life (though personally I tend to be optimistic, much healthier and true also, I am very lucky to be born a white male in North America in the 21st century in an economically free state in the U.S. specifically. How luckier can you get? You seem to be smart also, so that is also a lucky thing that happened to you and me. We happened to be smart. You should be happy that these things happened to you! But don't take pride in them as of course, you didn't cause them, even if free will was true, which it isn't. Optimism is the way to go in life, in my opinion. It's just so much happier and healthier that way, to not take things for granted and to find happiness from simply existing (mindfulness meditation helps immensely here), not from worrying about what qualities you have or what judgments people make of you or what you make of yourself. Just from feeling, existing, breathing. That is what mindfulness meditation SHOWS you, although it can be tricky to do it at first if you've never tried it before, but it is an amazing, secular, tool.\n\nWhat we do with the people who just don't understand empathy and society's rules is that we prevent them from rampantly breaking those rules by imprisoning them. I personally don't believe the government is necessary for this, there can be private courts (ala Judge Judy, an arbitrator; and more serious courts than that if need be) without the government intruding on our lives with force to imprison these cocksuckers. Sure, they aren't to blame, but they CANNOT be allowed to roam freely doing as they please, obviously. So the clearest, easiest, cheapest answer is to lock them up. But it must be for actual crimes, not victimless ones like any drug offense, here in America we lock up FAR, FAR too many people we have 5% of the world's population and 25% of the world's PRISON population, our prisons are so overflowing that people have to wait days or weeks even just to get into the general living area of inmates where they all sleep on bunkbeds lined up in rows in a huge room. So OBVIOUSLY, our prison system needs to change. But, of course, we will still imprison the people that NEED to be imprisoned.\n\nDeath actually is a \"bad\" thing if you believe that there are desirable and undesirable outcomes. I believe that because we are all basically computers, we COULD live amorally. But such a life would be very risky, and evolution proved this to be true because humans are naturally altruistic; that is, they are good people, they help others! Not necessarily \"naturally\" in the sense that it is genetically imprinted in all of us, but society has developed in such a way that it is taught almost universally, so most people do develop altruism. And humans are natural and we haven't broken out of our evolutionary heritage so it must be natural to be altruistic. But the same man (Sam Harris) who convinced me that free will is an illusion also convinced me that science can at least partially determine human morality because we know what inputs to put into a human system that will produce happiness and pleasure. But he says there are many peaks and many valleys of human happiness and suffering and he calls this the moral landscape. Look up \"Sam harris moral landscape\" if you want to know more about that. But I believe death is UNDESIRABLE as life exists solely to reproduce, so why would it be desirable to end that cycle?\n\nThe reason the world is so fucked up today especially compared to certain times in the past is mostly, I believe, due to states, a.k.a. governments, around the world fucking up hard in the last several decades.\n\nSorry for the massive-ass book.

{"cid": "UgjcHPBCfrhnZngCoAEC.80SxynajR3M72_dPPscC1O", "text": "@ghostsade3¬†Thank you for replying! I thought you wouldn't answer at all, and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't. I would blame god! ;D\n\nSo... god. What is god? Well... you will probably think that I am crazy for saying this... but let me warm up with saying that I think having positive beliefs can be good as long as they don't go against science. With positive, I mean beliefs that can motivate you, or in any other way help you, not like the beliefs of I.S. and such.\n\nAnd I have my own religion!\nIt is very simple. Or it could be very complicated. I can sum it up with one word: Infinity. I believe in infinity.\nThe simplest way to understand infinity, is to say ... one. Everything is one. Everything else, is just infinity... being infinite. Now, believing in infinity means believing that everything have happened, will happen and happens right now. This means that yes, indeed, there might actually be a god up there. Or twenty. Or a million. I have no idea. But I know that infinity is the one \"god\" everything comes from. Because of this, I know that I am god, I am infinity itself, and I created this life I am currently living.\n\nAnd to go a little deeper: Let's say we have this oneness. Now, out of this oneness comes new worlds, new layers of existence, that is all based upon the oneness, or infinity. When we die, how do we know if we will return back to this oneness, or just go to another layer, just a little closer to the oneness? Of course, at one point we will come back to that oneness, since... infinity, right? :)¬†Oh god, I am getting crazy of this :D We aren't supposed to understand this, that's the crazy part of it. And we can't know what I said now, maybe not even when we are dead.\nOh wow, I write a lot too.\nI have so much so say about this... another funny thing with it, the individuality you feel. Like, you and I are two individual persons, right? FALSE! We are the same fucking thing. You get it? We are everything. And to drag souls into this too, you aren't the human. You are the soul riding the fucking human. We are all human-riding souls. But at the same time, we are all the atoms that build up everything around and within us. This is infinity. We are the playground, and we play with it.\n\nSo... yeah. That's my definition of god. One. God is one. But in the same time, god is ... a million. A billion. There is no limits. God is everything. God is hate, god is love.\n\nFuck, this is my fucking inspiration.. I can't stop to write about this.\n\nBut believe me, if this goes against science one day, I will throw it away. I'm not stupid enough to stay in my bubble when the surroundings change.\n\nDude, I have just one more thing to mention. This one is actually crazy, and I don't know what to think. I'm not crazy, I'm not going to actually believe in this before it makes enough sense. I had math. I did 1*1 and got 1. While when I did 2*1 I got 2. And 2*2 and got four. And 1*1*1 equals 1 too. You get it? Infinity * infinity doesn't work. That's why 1 is a \"magical\" number. 1 is everywhere. We just don't get it. 1*1*1*1*1*1*1 is 1 too! You see how strange it is? You could have ... infinite 1's, and it would still be 1.\nMath is like the rules in this world, math is the rules everything goes by. And 1 is a part of this math. It is just that this 1, is the infinity of math. If you get it. What everything comes from.\nI don't know what to make of the fact you can get 2 by doing 1+1. Maybe, since 1 is everything, you can't \"+\" 1 with anything else, since there is nothing else to \"+\" with.\n\nYou must think I am crazy. But I have been thinking about this for a while... and yeah. This is my religion.\nEverything is possible! :)", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Peter Grimstad"}

Your definition might differ with mine. So it's pointless to debate over it.¬†\n\nAlso, in my comment I specifically mentioned \"in some ways, he's lucky\". And I will stick with my statement. Everyone is lucky in some ways and unlucky in others. It's just how it works.\n\nOne of my best friends died a few years back when he was 20. He didn't \"reproduce\" as well. He didn't get to achieve the goals that he was more than capable of achieving. I still remember him of course. His parents remember him. His brother remembers him. At most a 100 people remember him ? 500 ? I would still say the same thing about him. He was unlucky that he died so young. And it saddens me immensely that he did. But doesn't mean he wasn't lucky in some other ways.\n\nNow compare that with this kid. Because of his rare disease he got the chance to experience so so much. And now that he's dead, surely it's tragic and all but millions of people are sad for him. He's immortal on the internet. We're still having this debate about him months after he passed away. So yes, I believe he is also lucky in more ways than one.\n\nAnyways, Cheers.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "iKilledMyFunny"}

I wonder if this is how most people with religious affiliation perceive atheists. If so, then my capacity of faith for mankind has plunged even further than it already has. Seriously, how heartless do you theists believe we are? Because apparently a particular majority of you people seem to view us as inhumane, inconsiderate, and persistent. Little did you know that we have healthy amounts of sympathy. HEALTHY AMOUNTS. I admire Sam Berns's personality, his fortitude, his intellect. And if you think for a split second that the first thing that came to mind when I discovered that he had died a month later was him in a fertilizer pit, congratulations, sir. Your ignorance level has skyrocketed past comprehensible limits. The essential belief of an atheist is the lack of a universal being. I WONDER HOW THIS BELIEF EQUATES TO ATHEISTS BEING INHUMANE, INCONSIDERATE, AND PERSISTENT. I've gone to a Catholic middle school and I attended freshman year at a Catholic high school so I can somewhat guarantee that I know Catholicism. I've read Leviticus, it's crazy I know; I've read bits and pieces of the Gospel, we had to, for it was commonly referred to in my homework. I stopped being a theist because I hate dependence on others; I didn't get the idea of a universal being, it didn't click with me; I hated the idea of wasting my time on prayers that have no guaranteed benefit  because I'd rather make a difference right now with my own two PHUCK'IN hands, you get me? Sure some atheists are rotten apples, but are you telling me that all theists are good red apples? I want you to read through the first 30 or so comments in the comment section, and I want you to find me one comment by an obvious atheist that harbored malicious intent toward Sam Berns's. There are none! They only look bad because of the radical atheist and theist replies to them. For instance, a religious comment may receive a negative atheistic reply, vice versa.

If you've got a working body, with none of the debilitating issues that this young man had, then the only thing holding you back from being happy is you. Your outlook is overtly cynical, as I have no idea how seeing the life this kid lead was \"fortunate\". His spotlight came from a disease, which meant for all those that might give him attention, there were others who would avert their eyes like he was a leper, or treat him with what they'd deem polite pity. He had no chance at a normal life and died right at the cusp of adulthood, having not experienced anything at all similar or with the passing fortune so many of us take for granted. Hell, I remember fucking up my knee in wrestling back in high school. Everyone treated me differently when I had a wheel chair and crutches. It was pity and it drove me insane, but that was only for 4 months of my life, this young man had to deal with it from day 1. Progeria meant that Sam and others like him new their clocks were only a quarter spun, so making the most of their situation is really all they can do. If someone honestly feels like a debilitating disease would better their lives, then not only are the sick in the head, but they're pathetic as well.\n\nWhat's stopping you from doing what you're passionate about? Do you have anything similar to this kid? Are you disabled in some way? You obviously have spare time or you wouldn't be on here looking up videos. So instead of buggering all your time on videos and cynical comments, do what you're passionate about. Write, read, run, lift, dance, draw, paint, sing, learn something, etc etc. Just do it for christ's sake. You want life advice? Keep pushing forward, because there's no turning back and the pause button doesn't work. We all have tough times, but it is how you handle yourself and what you do, regardless of whatever bullshit excuse you might come up with to say otherwise. The only thing stopping you is you.

I'm going to start by analyzing some of the things you just said. I'll even use and extend your metaphors. First off, how can you say i \"experienced trying to get somewhere with a sailing ship during a heavy storm, but never experienced the same with no wind at all.\" lets talk about this. First off, you say i had a \"sailing ship\" I can say a few things to this, first, How do you think i got a sailing ship? I built it, i worked hard. Or, another way to look at it,  i did what i had to do to make it aboard that sailing ship. How do you know i've never experienced the same with no wind at all? Trust me there were plenty of times there was no wind at all. You know what i did? Jumped off the boat and swim, pull out the paddles and start rowing through the storms if you have no wind. The point is this, if you want something bad enough you go get it. I had plenty of things happen to me that i could have sat around crying to the world about how fucked up my life is and go justify stealing and robbing and selling drugs, and everything else. I didn't do that, even though i had the excuse. I faced my challenges, some of the people in this thread are speaking from experience, we're not just making this shit up, we lived through hardships, and made it through. I come now and then to watch videos like this to remind myself that there are people out there that have had other big challenges. The challenges i faced were of extreme poverty, homelessness, and family problems. But i see people like the kid in this video and it reminds me that i had good health (relatively). Many people read or hear about my story and they tell me its very inspirational. I dont find it that way, but when i see someone with a physical disability and they are still able to do the same things as full able body people, that to me is strength and inspirational. I dont know what hardships you might be facing, but half of your post have one philosophy about helping people, and another is \"why care about people who dont care about you\" you talked about being cold-hearted, and these things in earlier post and that was a cold hearted thing to say, thats something I would say. Yes i can be cold hearted at times, and some of the other things you mentioned in earlier post. I'm not saying that having hardships makes you a better person, but it does create a type of strength. There are many different types of strengths. Some people find strength in helping others, and some find it in taking advantage of others. My philosophy is do what ever gives you strength, weather its good for you or for everyone, that doesn't matter. Do what gives you strength, period. I find strength in being selfish, but i've embraced who i am. I've joined two community service projects full time. I dont get paid, i just give a living stipend, its called americorp. I did that to try and understand what its like to not be so selfish and to give back and i know its very draining to care about people more than they care about themselves. When people take advantage of kindness it can be really discouraging. I was working last year with students as a mentor. It was very draining.  I am however grateful  for people like you, who do help other people, the world and people like me need people like you. There is a balance to the world, there are people like me, and people like you, its what makes the world great. Furthermore, I never saw the movie slumdog millionaire, and have no desire to. However, you say \"Well, give me the script and I can make a few tiny tweaks to it and he will fail miserably.\" how about this, how about you take the script of YOUR life, make a few tiny tweaks to it and succeed tremendously. and i dont know, maybe you have, and if you are happy, and you do live the dream you've always had, then share it, be positive and dont spread these ideas that you've done in these replies. Honestly, one day you'll figure it out you seem very intelligent.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "tj1990"}

I actually had and still have to find a personally healthier mix of empathy vs. egotism. The strength of character and virtue I developed make things more difficult for me. Certain avenues are not an option, because I am also sensitive, and some stuff that others do casually and in convenient ignorance would hurt me if I did them in pursuit of my career.\nThere are also very old patterns in the mix that can be extremely difficult to overcome even with the ideal means available.\nI had to literally become one with God just to lay the groundwork for making a small step forward years later, that I intended to work with then and which turns out opens up yet another can of opposing forces and problems. I guess you could call that making tweaks in my script, but then again, probably not according to how I used the metaphor, because I was changing myself and not the events I face. I have worked on myself and changed myself diligently, and have realized that the saying \"Change yourself and the world around you will change\" is pseudo-spiritual popculture life-advice, designed to comfort the speaker, not the receiver. The real wisdom and life skill¬† is usually much grittier and more unsettling.\nAnger has served me better than positive thinking, so there's an example of potentially unsettling life truths. But I can handle it. It's usually others who can't. The always-think-positive crowd.

I can see how you might think that motivational speakers don't often evaluate the feelings of the individuals they're speaking to. There is an insensitivity i can agree in some cases. Other people aren't as strong or willed as they may have been, and because they had the willpower to do something, they think everyone should/could have the same level of motivation, drive and determination as them, without evaluating their feelings which maybe preventing them from having that same will power or motivation.

The one who went through hardships shows that they have truly overcome them and become stronger if they don't try to apply their experience to everybody else's. When they do, it might be because they feel they need it, they need to believe that it was all just their own doing and making the right choices. The alternative would threaten the confidence-boost that the success-experiences have given, and this then shows that there is still a fear at work, a fear of losing that helpful belief. Some people become outright mean and arrogant because of that, getting corrupted by a survival-of-the-fittest mindset.\n\nWe have so many people in distress who seek out self-empowerment advice because the world is being shaped significantly by the same belief system that raises the self on a pedestal. But if people made the profound internal step of empowering the common, of helping each other, then the world would create less of that distress. Ego is about separation from the whole, so it is inherently fear-based. That fear needs to be kept in check in order to create a healthier and more pleasant world. And it is not about eliminating separation. It is one half of life experience. But balance is health, and the amount of suffering in the world shows that there is a severe imbalance. It causes the symptoms that signal a need for change. Signals that too few (want to) recognize and understand.\nThe problem is also that when you keep feeding a world of separation by teaching enough people the gospel of self-empowerment, further increasing an imbalance in the whole system, they will have to compete against each other. It is a vicious circle; a belief system that provides its own growing validation. A zero-sum game in a world that needs new to be brought into it.\n\nI can be at my best when working with people who work on their fears. But when surrounded by people who are willing slaves to them, it can feel like torture, a nightmare, soulcrushing meaninglessness.

Attending a university might open certain doors (then again, wouldn't be anything new if totally not), but it's a huge investment for realistically very little. It would depress me.\nI also don't think pursuing the educational/intellectual path would be worth it, since the problem doesn't lie with lack of information, but with lack of interest in seeking it out. So I prefer the creative-artistic path, which feels more fulfilling, but has its downsides, too.\nBasically, all I can do is be myself and not torture myself too much about not achieving what I want. I've tried so many approaches.

You said \"Some people become outright mean and arrogant because of that, getting corrupted by a survival-of-the-fittest mindset.\" This is me all the way. I find it very difficult to form relationships, im always fighting and arguing with people. I've become quite successful so i throw it into peoples faces, i put people down making myself feel better doing so. I do it all just to give contrast to the things that i've done. Its really bad. I've been fired from a lot of jobs because i cant form relationships or work well in teams. Overall, while i've been able to be \"successful\" in terms of having a career, and money, and being happy in some areas, its a false sense of happiness. Its a happiness derived from putting others down or keeping them down, so that i can stay at the top. My last boss described it as \"a heart of war\" i always think someone is trying to take advantage of me, take something from me, steal from me, i dont trust anyone at all, and im always looking for a fight. I just lie to myself telling myself that im ok being alone, because most people dont want to be around me.  i understand why i am the way i am. Think of it like a dog, that was abused its whole life, do you think that dog will turn out to be a very nice dog? no, its going to jump up and steal the food right out your hand, because that dog doesn't know the next time its going to eat. Sometimes i struggle with how i've become, other times i embrace it.\n\n\n Right now I'm an IT Apprentice and this is working out pretty well.

After all, in a difficult environment, it has served you; it was or at least appeared to be necessary.\nIt is not ideal to close the heart, but when we do, it means there's a reason why we did, and that is always valid. The problems that have such effects on people can only be solved when we don't play the blame game.\nFor someone with a 'heart of war' though, you are quite unconfrontational in writing here. Especially these days, I usually see very quickly whether someone treats a discussion like a fight to be won or an opportunity for mutual enlightenment, and the result here is solid evidence that you're not that deep into trouble; a good sign.\nA practice that might help you is this: Allow yourself to be vulnerable. I know very well from own experience and am struggling with it myself: We succeed not when we trust that things will turn out alright (that's the popculture wisdom which can lead to horrible wounds), but when we expect that things might fail and can handle it and go on regardless. Or remember Rocky Balboa: It's not about how hard you can hit, but how hard you can get hit, and get up again. Interestingly, from what you wrote before one would think you are excellent at that, but of course you have your limit, too. You are shielding your heart from further hurt. That you are aware of the problem with that is good. It means you know what you have to do; gradually, step by step.\nI don't know whether you are familiar with brony stuff, but in My Little Pony, Fluttershy is like a shining example of this: She is very sensitive and vulnerable, and she has that impressive ability of not closing her heart in painful situations, but allowing herself to hurt fully (thus embracing her true nature), and in that way gets over it quickly and without scars, and that is strength through weakness. (Profound wisdom so often seems contradictory, because the mind cannot comprehend the heart.) But: This also depends on whether the environment allows her to live that way, to find that strength. And that's where the magic of friendship comes into play.\n\nRecently, during a ceremony where I connected with a wiser version of myself, I reminded myself to always express my feelings and worries openly, that it can only enrich my life. It is a teaching of overcoming fear. And that's what the game of life is about.\nAnother allegory: Do you know Avatar - The Last Airbender? Zuko fueled his firebending with rage. At some point, he resolved his anger issues and then realized he couldn't firebend anymore and that that had been the source of energy, so he now had to find a healthy source to fuel his ability again, which he had thought was the essence of wrath. Maybe that's a bit like the challenge you are now facing - a motivational transition. It can be scary. I remember someone telling me she had become a successful lawyer, and at some point she resolved a bunch of emotional issues with her family and in the process realized that all her career success was due to her unhealthy desire to please her parents. She no longer felt a desire for that career path and changed her life. Of course it's not easy, but acting based on a healthier version of yourself is good. ...

That the only way for people to be happy is to be in ideal circumstances and to be able to do the things they are passionate about. That's not true. Happiness comes from within.

Now human created amazing things. things ants will never achieve or even be aware of. ants to humans is like humans to god. If he can create everything, consciousness included, how can us ants even begin to understand him? theres no way to prove god, but theres also no way to disprove him, the only ones that could tell the truth are past our reach, but lucky for us, one day we'll join their company, and we will share the truth.

So the question is, do believe in coincidences or do believe theres a purpose/significance? Thanks for reading this monologue, i tried to keep it as exciting as possible. PS religion doesn't negate science. like i said I'm a logical guy, theres fools in both categories, some christians fight science for that reason, they're fools, some athiests are fools as well. Science is simply humans way to perceive the world around them. its the way we categorize and understand it, science is just another definition, we have thousands of those in the dictionary, religion is definition too. And to answer your last question, I think gods plan is to test us, whenever humans make something we test it to see how it works. For him to take our free will away proves nothing, letting us make our own choices is significant. For what I can't say.

It's just an assumption that isn't based on any facts whatsoever. I'd also like to point out that God needn't be disproved until he is proved in the first place. I use this saying quite often: \"that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.\"\n\nI'd like to touch on your last thought as well. You seem to think that the conditions on our planet (and in the universe itself) are incredibly rare. That's very understandable, seeing as we don't have much to base these things on. But you are making the mistake of underestimating the sheer size of the universe. The entirety of space has been expanding for about 13.8 billion years. That's a very long time. There is a whole lot of matter with which to form stars and planets. To think that life is exclusive to Earth is absurd. We have a general idea of how life can be formed. We know for a fact how it can be diversified. More recently, we've discovered an incredible amount of planets that could potentially support life. You must also keep in mind that life on Earth is made up of the most common elements in the universe. It's not crazy to think that life is common given this information, is it? It would be a different story if we were made of tungsten or something.

Just to add to the discussion: if struggle is a test from God, why are some people's lives so much worse than other people's? Why is do some people have to struggle with natural disasters, starvation, disease, etc, when others have a perfectly good life and a great upbringing? Surely that's injustice; an unfair and inaccurate test of human adequacy? Also, if God is omniscient, why would he have to test us at all, seeing as he can already forsee the results? Surely it's unnecessary pain? Additionally, wouldn't there be ways, in an unimaginable spectrum of possibility that is unlimited by experience, to test out morals without unnecessary suffering? If God is omnipotent, I'm sure s/he could come up with some way or another. \n\nFurthermore, progressing onto more uneven terrain, if God is omniscient, and therefore knows what our choices are going to be beforehand, that eliminates our ability to make a different decision in any situation, therefore eliminating our free will, and making the 'test' pointless to begin with.\n\nMoreover, seeing as the existence of God gives us purpose and meaning in life, and the lack thereof ultimately is much more difficult to live with psychologically, as it devalues us, surely we would be in a position of bias in declaring that God exists without evidence, as we have a reason to want to believe that.\n\nAs well as this, if God did exist, why would he create us in a way that would make us subjectable to 'sin'? In response to the existence of good and evil as seperate entities to science to support the existence of God, I believe that the morals do exist in coordination with science: they exist to enable us to survive better as a species. \n\nWhat do you think?Ôªø", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Tamara Lloyd"}

No I didn't read your entire post mainly because your grammar is atrocious, but I've heard every argument from here to Nazareth and I've seen the first part of Zeitgeist like five times so let's do this.\n\nI used to believe in god! When I was like six, and I had a whole crew of imaginary friends who brought me presents and candy. Oh, and pro wrestling, too! Those were the good old days. Then one year I found all my Christmas presents in my parent's closet a few weeks prior to Christmas, and in the next few months everything collapsed. Santa wasn't real, Easter Bunny was a fraud, and that damn lying Tooth Fairy... So wait, why the fuck are we still saying grace? God didn't put this food on our table I literally watched you go to work, you were gone all day, and then you bought that fucking turkey! I saw it! Why does god get the credit? He didn't assemble depth-finders for 8 hours in a sweaty warehouse in downtown Shakopee and he didn't go grocery shopping for us! That's akin to North Koreans thanking Kim Jong-Un for their meals! Except, you know, without the nukes.\n\nNow for a more somber note. I can't remember exactly how old I was (I believe I was between 12 and 14) the last time I prayed. I was laying in bed in my room bawling my eyes out. I had just received my midterm report card complete with four Fs and a D, which normally sounds like a fun night out but it prompted my father to call me, and I quote, worthless. So as I'm laying there crying about how right he was I decided to pray, because fuck it nothing else was working. I prayed and all I asked for was some kind of sign, literally, anything that could straight up tell me It would be okay. Seriously anything. A bird could have flown into my window and smashed his face I would have found it hilarious and I probably would have felt better. My mom could have just popped her head in and said \"It''s going to be okay\". Nah. I got nothing. I got more silence and darkness. I went upstairs later my parents just glared at me. That's the day my faith completely died.\n\nI'll admit my initial turn to atheism was out of spite. Bad stuff happened to me and I blamed god because everyone said he loved me and all that jazz, but then I started to actually learn stuff about Christianity. The stories are absolute bullshit. The book is just a million metaphors that boil down to \"don't be a dick\". Finally, the entire bundle of concepts that is \"god/satan/heaven/hell\" is the PERFECT ANSWER to the MOST ASTRONOMICALLY HUGE QUESTION IN EXISTENCE and I find that so impossible that us tiny insignificant humans would be able to find that answer and even be partially right. The question, by the way, is a combo of \"why are we here, and where will we go after this?\". Also, when I say perfect answer, I mean it's exactly what you would want to hear! \"Come on down to Christianity everybody! We've got everything you'll ever need! A loving and tender god!

In track and field, you might have a coach who encourages you to be better, despite he yells at you and constantly implies you can do better. The thing is that it isn't the coach that makes you better, but it's yourself. And once you want to be a better you, the coach can help you make a better you, because that's what he's for. And when you see your better you, you can thank your coach, because along with your pushing yourself, the coach gave his judgment to you to try to do better and run past your own limitations.\nI will never forget my coach telling me, \"I'm not teaching you to run without pain. I'm teaching you to run through the pain\". He also encouraged the team to \"not do it for your friends, or your family, or even me. Do it for yourself!\" Again, I repeat, the coaches are there to help you make a better you. The victory is to both you and the coach if you pushed yourself.\n\nThis is the kind of love God has for you and I. You've been given challenges ever since you were born. Complaining doesn't do anything for you, now does it?

That question is a big question and would take much text to answer and you probably would not get a whole answer. I would encourage you to read \"Is God a Moral Monster?\" by Paul Coplan. Although I don't think he answers perfectly to every topic he overviews but it may help you understand.\n\nWith that being said, I would like to give you a quick answer to your question. This happens because God loves us. Yes that sounds kind of stupid right? Imagine if I were to say, \"I love you; here are the Measles\". You would think, what a freak!\n\nYou see, in the beginning, God created the earth and everything on it and said that is was GOOD. Now because he loved us, He gave Adam and Eve a choice. If a robot is programmed to love, is it really love? Can you make your child love you? can you make your crush love you? how about at gun point? is it love or is it pressure? You see God gave a choice, To be near to him or to be far from him. But, sadly, Adam and Eve were tempted and chose to disobey the one who had Created. Now, if God is perfection then the polar opposite is chaos, disorder and imperfection. The world has fallen, the earth is getting worse, the climate is becoming more and more poor, birth defects are becoming even more regular. All because this world has been made ungood through our choice. As a side note to another part of your question, God does not create babies, they are a product of a fallen world and the two individuals who came together to conceive the child. \n\nBut the good news. God, because he wouldn't just abandon his creation that he loved, He sent his perfect, sinless son, Christ, (Himself). The almighty creator sacrificed his own fleshly body on the cross as a covering for our abandoning of him. to invite us back to where there is perfection. We must only choose. This world will then pass away and a new heaven and a new earth, where non of those troubles pester us, will then replace it. But, because he loves us he wants to give everyone the opportunity, but if he forced you, would that be love?\n\nI hope this helps you to understand, even if only a little.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Thanael Christian"}

The second verse is not talking about rape at all but consensual sex initiated by the man as was custom. This is further confirmed in Exodus 22:\n\n16¬†‚ÄúIf a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 17¬†If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money equal to the dowry for virgins.\n\nThe reason you leave out the previous verse showing true rape is because for one thing you probably didn't even read it because you got the quote from some atheist website. You use a very specific mistranslation to make the verse seem as though its saying something it isn't because of your biased agenda. You'll notice that these atheist websites pick and choose from a variety of different translations to find that which seems to best misrepresent something as immoral to make it APPEAR as though you have a legitimate gripe. This is because you don't actually care about truth but of convincing others and yourself that you are right by any means possible, whether you are actually right or not, whether substantive or superficial, all that matters is the negative image you can produce to others against that which you see as your enemy.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "&Abel"}

So I would be damned to Hell for something I didn't even do (Original Sin), unless I admit and proclaim that God punished someone else for that sin (Jesus/Himself)? By saying 'Jesus died for my sins'. While also punishing himself for my own sins (Because of the absurd Trinity notion) So now he is punishing one person/himself for the sins of everyone? And if we don't admit this, then we are still screwed by that Original Sin? Which is punishing everyone for the sins of Adam and Eve? That's laughable.\n\nIt's unbelievable how people like yourself consider this to be the stance of a just, fair God. So no matter what I do in my life, my sins, my good deeds, none of that really matters, because Adam and Eve sinned thousands of years ago? That sounds like a rather heinous, spiteful, grudge-bearing, irrational, unjust, unrelenting God....Original Sin and Salvation through Christ is nothing more than a ploy used to sway the people of that era.¬†\n\nIf someone came into your house 2am, snatched you out of bed, tossed you in a cell on death row awaiting execution, and you finally get an answer to your question as to why, by being told \"Well, your great-great-great grandfather broke a law...so you are going to have to be punished now, by being tortured mercilessly. But wait! The judge said that there is a way you can get out from this! He said he will punish his son (and himself...as if that makes sense) for the crime, and you can go free! You just have to tell everyone about it. And not only that! He will give you a get out of jail free card, so you won't ever have to be punished...not for your ancestors crime, and not for your own crimes! ¬†All you have to do is tell people about it!\"¬†\nYou would probably respond with \"So basically, no matter what I do in my life...I'm automatically damned, unless I follow your philosophy, and then i'll automatically be blessed? So I guess this means that now I can go kill, rob, rape, and do whatever, now that I will be given eternal life and rewarded with Heaven...all I have to do is just say Jesus died for me.\"¬†\n\nIf a teacher promised her entire class an A+ for the final grade, what makes you think her students are going to study or even crack open a book? ¬†\n\nIf that scenario seems absurd and something that would never be acceptable in our society, as humans, what makes you think God would follow those same guidelines?\nIt's absolutely ludicrous for those same principles to exist in society...why the fuck would you see that as fair when it has to do with eternity.\nI don't know about you, but I'd rather worship a God who will judge me based on my own sins, my own good deeds, my own actions. Not a God that would hold a grudge against me for something I didn't even do, or punish one for all, or all for one. The philosophy of Original Sin and Salvation is nothing more than a recruitment tool used to increase followers, by scaring them into believing that they will be damned if they don't, no matter if they lived righteously or gracefully, while also telling them that they will be rewarded, regardless, by just claiming Salvation in Christ.¬†\n\nThere is only one God worthy of worship. He has no partners, no equals, no relatives. My standing in the afterlife won't be conditional on another human being. Not Adam. Not Eve. Not Jesus.¬†", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Ali Zafar"}

Its been a few years since bible study, but let me see if I can't do a quick rundown...\n\n1. Eve is created from one of Adam's ribs. I.e- she is just a piece of him. He is the original man and she is the product of him. Woman is there for the pleasure and delight of men, and that is all.\n\n2. Eve is responsible for \"original sin\".\n\n3. For most of history and on into today, women couldnt hold the most important positions in the church.\n\n4. Lot gives his virgin daughters and maidservant up to a mob to be gang raped. The servant is raped brutally and dies at her masters door. He hacks her body into pieces and dumps it.\n\n5.\"Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.\"\n\n6. Adultresses are to be stoned to death. Male cheaters...not so much.\n\n7. Men will not touch or go anywhere near a woman who has her period.\n\n8. Women in the bible are CONSTANTLY traded for, bartered with, treated as ABSOLUTE property. At one point Jacob makes a deal for Labans daughter Rebecca, but Laban wants to keep the her since she is prettier. Instead he sends in his daughter Leah. Jacob has sex with Leah and in the morning, demands that he get to have sex with Rebecca instead. He does.\n\nYou can go on and on and on......If you think that the founding book ofChristianity thinks of women as equals, and to be respected and valued....you havent read your book.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "westcoastOGee"}

And yes, it does give me a sense of morality. Without Jesus Christ, I would have continued in the same self convenient sense of morality that you have. You should take notice next time youre in a morally questionable situation faced with a decision to do the right thing and see how many excuses you come up with to justify doing the wrong thing. The difference between me and you is that I would hope to do the right thing even when it was a disadvantage to me or even hurt me, every time. I do this because of God. God IS morality and atheists think they dont need God to be moral. Its a laugh. God invented morality and anybody who thinks they dont need God for morality is just riding on His coat tails.

I understand what you are saying and I can identify with it. I also can identify with atheism, which was the final stage of my lack of spirituality before I got saved. And when I say I got saved, I'm not talking about the empty alter call situation that they perform at every conclusion of mainstream protestant church services. My moment of salvation came when I was alone. To make a long story short, I actually had a supernatural encounter with the Holy Spirit. Up until that point I had not really believed in God and always had this reservation in my heart about wanting God to prove He was real. After my experience I have never looked back and I continue to seek a relationship with Him daily. Jesus is real. It's really fantastic. You must go back and search for Him again.

This is because you have been blinded by evil, tricked into making you feel like Jesus is unnecessary in your life. This has caused many Christians to turn their backs on God and follow Satan's path of destruction willingly and with confidence without knowing it.\n\nAn answer to your question on whether or not eternal life is realistic can be found through God's word and His teaching¬† through His son Jesus Christ. I can state to you now that eternal life is not a \"magical\" myth, considering all the miracles God and Jesus performed on people's lives were in fact supernatural happenings themselves. There is a reason that God gave up His only son to die for us! An opportunity for us to grasp eternal life with Him in heaven through the forgiveness of our sins.\n\nAll those \"Christians\" who say you never were are \"true\" Christian cannot judge you like that. You know yourself if you were or not. These people who judge your connection with Him are in fact not \"true\" Christians themselves!\n\nIf you choose to be a Christian or not, God has given you the choice. If you turn down God's blessing it is like turning down life itself! Evil will consume your thoughts and actions, causing you to do things without even noticing it!\n\nNow I am not saying you cannot be a good person without Jesus, you are just not complete with Him, under His divine spiritual protection.\n\nI do hope you realise that God back in your life will make you so much happier and fulfilled. Why wait till you are about to die? That is just another way of saying that you only want His gift and not a relationship with Him.\n\nI do hope you reconnect your relationship with Jesus, as well as all the other people who don't have a relationship with Him.

But still, this pagan's book altered hell for ever. The first image of hell we have in mind is that of Dante Alighieri. \n\nBefore that, the associations with hell were very different. Actually, what has been translated as hell was not even one, but three words: Sheol, Hades and, if I recall it correctly, Gehenna. Just to show how much has changed. \n\nDante's version of hell wasn't based upon the actual source, it was a free interpretation of how Dante thought hell would be.\n\nAnd now to the actual argument: I believe that, should a person want to leave hell, he could. However, all that the person wants is to sin: he wants to take drugs, he wants to have sex and so on. The sins that filled his life are still with him in his death, and since he doesn't accept God's help because he wants the sin instead, he is trapped in his very own hell forever.\n\nThat is also explains how hell is worse for one than another since a person that craves for more obviously lacks and thus suffers more. \nEven if God (and I believe he does) were to offer him paradise, he would deny it as he only sees the sin.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Random Panda"}

If God does not exist, and according to scientific theory you could prove this using direct evidence. If the theory of evolution is correct, where are the direct linking forms of evidence? where are all the bones of the \"mutations\" that allowed for evolution to take place? We have dinosaur bones and they existed hundreds of milions of years ago, but have no evidence of such \"evolved\" beings from other life forms to prove it.\nIf evlotion were to exist, why can we not reproduce such \"evolution\"? And, in order to bash God or christian beliefs and religion, should you not actually educate yourselves on what christianity and the bible actually teach?\n\nPredestination is not a uniquely held belief in the Christian religion, in fact in a major part of Christianity, the idea that God gives us the chance and opportunity to actively \"seek\" him. Maybe in the grand scheme of things, he actually created the idea of evolution and/or evolution to allow us to make that choice with a possible and plausible other choice?\n\nI am sorry, but for the majority of you who claim to be \"enlightened\" or act as if you hold the truth in your hands, are quite admittedly self proclaiming to be ignorant by judging others on what you really cannot prove or explain yourselves or with existing evidence.

Let us first consider the former, the internal evidences.\nSelf-proclamation\n\nThe first fact is that the Bible claims to be the Word of God. The authors knew they were writing the words of God, even though they often did not fully understand what they were writing. 2 Timothy 3:16 states, \"All scripture is inspired by God.\" 2 Peter 1:21 states, \"No prophecy was ever made by an act of human will but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\" Jesus himself viewed the Old Testament as authoritative and quoted from it throughout his ministry.\n\nHoly Spirit\n\nSecond, the Holy Spirit confirms to us that the Bible is the Word of God. John 16:13 states, \"But when He, the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth.\" The Holy Spirit who convicts the world of sin also assures the believer that the Bible is God's Word.\n\nTransforming Ability\n\nThird, we have evidence concerning the transforming ability of the Bible. Hebrews 4:12 says, \"The word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit.\" Romans 12:2 says, \"And be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.\" The Word of God and the Spirit of God actually transforms the lives of people. The Bible has changed the lives of murderers, drug addicts, top government officials, business people, and students, to name just a few people from every walk of life who have been transformed by the Bible. No other book can make such a claim. This is because the Bible is not a mere book on good living but is literally packed with power. It is the Word of God with the power to change lives.\n\nThese are only three internal evidences supporting the authority of the Bible. ( That doesn't belong to me, it belongs to Pat Zukeran)\n¬†\nHistorical Evidence\n( this one's easy )\n1. GRAVITY\n¬†God stated That \"the world was held by nothing\" which meant gravity (can't see gravity) Before that, non-believers figured the world was held up by something- a man, a catfish, even a turtle. Know what happened? BAAAM proven wrong even before they thought they were proven right.¬†\n\nNow, that is barely picking at the surface of God's existence and yet I have made some pretty good points on atheism that many atheists don't want to admit. I never said God hated you. God doesn't hate anyone, he cries when we sin. He cries because He knows if we don't straighten up we'll be arguing in Hell. Whatever. Believe what you want to believe and I'll believe what I want to. We will know what happens to both of us in the end", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Kelly Knight"}

But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course, I could have given up my idea of justice by saying that it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist--in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless--I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality--namely my idea of justice--was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.\"\n-C.S. Lewis", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "HigherPhoto"}

Jesus was a loving and sinless man, he was a reincarnation of God as a human. he respresented love, while God represents an almighty being who is all powerful. He did that (i assume) to show both sides of himself. He may be harsh, but he is loving. The reason he is so harsh is because he wants us in the right direction.

We'll do it in steps shall we.\n1. The bible was written thousands of years ago, it has a long history with humans, simple enough to accept, why, because we can date back all the scriptures for thousands of years. Simple concept.¬†\n2. The bible, is not about 'real events' always. I mean, seriously, you can't truly use the bible as evidence for anything because it's not verified. We only use unverified evidence if it's the only option, like in history we only have a few scriptures and paintings to prove the Battle of Hastings for example, but in this case, when you're making an absurd comment about a magical unicorn, you have to give good evidence.\n3. Forgive me if I misunderstood, but you seem to be using a size matter argument So, because most of the people in Germany at one point were Nazis it is a more valid belief? One man create viable theories, and they can still be correct. If that wasn't true, we wouldn't have all the amazing inventions we have today, made by one man.¬†\n4. This is where you start to annoy me. First, scientists 100 times more intelligent than you would say otherwise, just saying, you can't make a final statement without that as evidently you have no real understanding of evolution. Evolution is a scientific theory, essentially a fact, god is just a theory, but so is the spaghetti monster. a. DO NOT GENERALIZE ATHEISTS, some atheist don't believe in evolution, some do, but all atheism is, is not believing in a god. b. You probably don't know this, but there are literally hundreds of bones found in specific places that we'd expect, mapping out the entirety of what we call evolution for primates Ok. We evolved from a common ancestor of 'apes', and we are all primates. Ok, that is at the very least a proven fact, do you know why, genetics. We can map out the genetics, see the differences between species, and find physical bones to prove that some kind of change happened. Also, its random, but not in that way. It's like, you have millions of parts of your genome that are different from your parents, and if it is big enough we call it a mutation, and mutations can be built up and make different creatures etc, it's a lot more complicated than that, but you get the gist. This takes millions of years mind you. Bye the way, this essentially wont happen with humans, because creatures that can't get enough food with a specific mutation die, and that's why it's survival of the fittest, but something like this wouldn't occur for humans because we can easily attain food and we are too spread out across the world, i.e., creatures wont evolve the same way by default.\n5. No-one thinks they're so high and mighty, but when you start saying things like this, it makes me feel, fairly good, I'm not going to lie. You are no better than an atheist and we are no better than you. We're all humans, and what you're doing is essentially discrimination.¬†\n6. We didn't start as a molecules lol. There were tests, the Miller Urey experiment for example, that proved life can start on it's own, from there as I said, millions of years pass by and these amino acids, as they start, and later prokeryotic, then eukeryotic cells, built up into big structures, and these big structures are what we can at least call fish ok. Remember, this took millions of years, and they were not modern day fish. btw, it is also scientifically proven that humans only arrived recently in the earths history, so we are pretty insignificant to be honest. Also, they didn't just grow legs, ever over millions of years they had mutations that eventually could be prominently seen as legs, similar to how we still have a tail bone, like all primates, or 'monkey' like creatures, but we have lost the full tail, over a LONG time, because we didn't need it anymore.¬†\n7. Last but not least, a. we've already covered, don't generalize, the reason I¬†\nam writing this is because I am actually pained by what you said, the lack of knowledge in your statement, I am not a know it all looking to harm you or your beliefs in any way, I just hat it when people make incorrect claims. b.

If you have so much reliability on science without using any in your own lives, how can you say a christian is a lunatic? You rely on something, we rely on someone. No atheist can say they don't rely on anybody or anything. This is from the website i mentioned before.¬†\nSo you're an atheist. Mazel Tov, at least you aren't wishy washy. As a former atheist myself, I won't condemn you. How could I? Some atheists think they've taken a heroic stand, but could it be that they really don't want to face up to the possibility that God is indeed there? I hope you'll be intellectually honest enough to consider what I have to say and see if it makes sense.\n\nNo one who has prejudged an issue can be convinced of anything contrary to what he wants to believe. There are still those who insist the earth is flat and no one can convince them otherwise, no matter what the evidence. There are always folks, no matter if religious or atheistic, who stubbornly believe what they prefer, no matter if reason and fact show otherwise. Someone like this has the unspoken philosophy: Don't confuse me with the facts. My mind is already made up. Ask yourself: Am I open-minded or narrow minded? Am I willing to change my mind if I can be shown atheism doesn't make sense?\n\nYou might say, If God is there, let him prove it to me. I don't want to take an irrational leap of faith. Fine. In Isaiah 2:18 God says: come let us reason together. He wants us to reason and He certainly wants us to be be rational, but He will not submit himself to human scrutiny; to do so he would need to stop being God! He will not bow to our perverse judgements. Ask yourself, Would I ever be willing to believe God is there, however strong the evidence? You see, your problem may not be in your head as much as in your heart. Perhaps you've already taken a leap of faith. To assert God cannot exist, despite the impossibility of proving that statement, is the ultimate irrational leap!Atheism tends to exalt reason, but it is actually irrational. Atheists tend to put a lot of stock in the emperical method and in logic. One cannot disprove God exists using the emperical method. You might reply: But I can't disprove a giant purple frog on Mars controls the universe, either. Granted, one can never disprove any given thing exists. The atheistic position denying God's existence, if based on the emperical method, is absurd. Why do I say that? ¬†In order to prove the assertion No God exists experimentally, one would need to comprehensively know all of reality. Comprehensive knowledge of reality is called omniscience. One would need to be omniscient in order to prove there is no God, but if one were omniscient one would, by definition, already be God! ¬†So, based on emperical methodology, the only one capable of disproving the existence of God would be God himself! ¬†But some would say you can indeed assert something does not exist if its existence is logically self contradictory, such as a square triangle. ¬†By definition it cannot exist. ¬†It is illogical for something to be a square and to also be a triangle. Again, granted, but this line of reasoning assumes logic and real meaning exist and are our basis for knowledge --something an atheist has no right to assert! The existence of God is not only logically possible, it is philosophically essential. (We'll get to that more later below.) One cannot prove logic exists unless one first presupposes a God in whom reason and meaning are transcendentally rooted, otherwise these categories are mere philosphical prejuduces. Atheism is inherently self-contradictory. The evidence for the existence of God is there for all to see, only we refuse to see it. King David wrote: The fool says in his heart there is no God. (Psalm 14:1) ¬†In other words, Atheism is irrational. Apart from God there is no basis for truth or ethics. For the sake of brevity, let's simply consider ethics.\nI think thats enough for one comment, read more on that site under disproving atheism.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Kelly Knight"}

Atheism, as far as I know, doesn't not claim to know God doesn't exist. Nor does it say that you can disprove something with empirical evidence. It basically states a statement will remain a statement until it is proved, God possibly being the statement. Still I am not saying God doesn't exist, merely there is no evidence to support his existence. The other issue I had with the article was morality. In case you don't know, morality is something we share as humans, and, to a lesser extent, more primitive animals are moral as well. They have laws, like don't kill from their own pack, and don't steak food etc. This is because it's a logical think to do. There is, at least to the human mind, a point in being moral. In the long run, it's all down to what your mind thinks. You don't NEED a 'holy book' to be moral. Although it can help some people. If anything, the bible actually taught me the opposite of morality, as I opposed to being scared - with hell - into being good. I just wanted to be good. Have a nice day :)¬†\nP.S.

Think of quantum tunneling, there was a time where it seemed like an impossibility. Where someone like Einstein couldn't even wrap his head around it. Why? Because there was no evidence. That made i impossible to believe. However, it happened to be real eventually, and we now have empirical evidence for it. There is currently no empirical evidence for God, so some people will use faith, which I have NO problem with. However, you could say the same about mythical creatures.

If you were a little child lets say 2 mounths old, and a pakistanien family adobted you and brought you to pakistan, would you still be on this sight as a Christian? The answer is no and the reason why is that religion is inharited. 90% of all religious people have there religion because off their parrents. So your religion is more or less based on where in the world you were born or raised. I dont say religion is bad, the way of living and how to be with others and all that is great and we should do that alot more, BUT god does not exist and it is time we realize that we dont need him any more. Who decided whom where to be the once that wrote the bible and HOW can i with 100% certaincy know that what he wrote is the FULL truth. What if i woke up tomorrow and said in public that i just spoke to god and he wants me to rewrite the bible, would i be allowed to do that or determent mentally sick and trown in a straitjacket for the rest off my life, hmm i thin option 2.

What kind of garbage is that?\"\n\nWhy is it garbage? I explained it here already, yet you ignored it:\nIf you don't have the will to believe in him you will never truly believe in him, evidence or not. You have to want it and that's where true faith begins. The thing is that you have to open your eyes to see the light. That's something god can't do for you. So stop demanding evidence, the second you want to believe is also the second where you realize you don't need proof. \nThis is the only way we can truly connect with God. Not because we are impressed by his power. Not because everyone does. Not because he's superior to us. No, this is on an equivalent level, and only based upon that we will be able to truly love him. Take the billionaire that disguises himself as a beggar so that the people he meets aren't nice to him because he's a billionaire but because of his character.\nI'm afraid you won't understand, no matter how often I explain it. Our views and experiences differ too much.\n\n\"What kind of hocus-pocus prankster Houdini God does things that way, especially when the stakes of belief are supposedly heaven and hell? Zero sense.\"\n\nAn almost cheesy approach you're taking here. Atheists often degrade one's believe to make it sound more silly. It only shows that they don't understand anything.\n\nWhile I really don't feel like it right now and while I've written this about ten times already, here we go:\n\nDante's divine Comedy is said to be the most influential book of the medieval times, only topped of course, by the bible. But still, this pagan's book altered hell for ever. The first image of hell we have in mind is that of Dante Alighieri. \n\nBefore that, the associations with hell were very different. Actually, what has been translated as hell was not even one, but three words: Sheol, Hades and, if I recall it correctly, Gehenna. Just to show how much has changed. \n\nDante's version of hell wasn't based upon the actual source, it was a free interpretation of how Dante thought hell would be.\n\nAnd now to the actual argument: I believe that, should a person want to leave hell, he could. However, all that the person wants is to sin: he wants to take drugs, he wants to have sex and so on. The sins that filled his life are still with him in his death, and since he doesn't accept God's help because he wants the sin instead, he is trapped in his very own hell forever.\n\nThat is also explains how hell is worse for one than another since a person that craves for more obviously lacks and thus suffers more. \nEven if God (and I believe he does) were to offer him paradise, he would deny it as he only sees the sin.Ôªø \nThat still doesn't mean hell isn't a pit of fire, but it's the sin that keeps one there.\n\n\"Its like buying a car and having someone say you just need to believe that there are airbags, refusing to tell you yes or no.\"\n\nAnd here again, you don't understand. If the seller says yes, it's still up to you to believe him. But this is an unfitting example.\n\n\"If he wants us to \"search for him\", then why would he have such an issue with showing himself? lol.\"\n\nSo I was right when I said that you wouldn't understand. You don't even try to. Start trusting God and he will answer you. The more you begin loving, the more he will come over you. But to you as an atheist, these are meaningless words.\n\n\"As it stands, theres as much evidence for his existence as there is for Vishnu, Zeus, or the easter bunny. And at least Zeus has lightning bolts and a sweet toga.Ôªø\"\n\nAnd there will never be evidence, and no human technology will ever be able to measure him. If it could, it could also tell where God is and where he's not and thus limit him.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Random Panda"}

Biology is a branch of scientific study, and it's not a theory. What does that even mean- you \"like\" them? If youd studied sciences at even the most fundamental levels, youd realize that faith and reason are mutually exclusive. Theyre just not compatible. You're not stupid. Its time to stop riding the fence. So you know that heaven doesn't exist, but you want to believe that it does because it gives you comfort? You're free to believe however you want, but just realize that's INSANE. Thats like ignoring the parking ticket under your windshield wiper because you dont want to deal with the stress of having to pay a fine.... or like keeping your dead wife's corpse seated at the kitchen table because pretending that shes still alive is easier than dealing with the reality.

Religion holds itself above critique or ridicule, and the faithful hold it as a point of pride that their faith needs no reason or proof to back it up. Religion has been the direct cause of hundreds of thousands of deaths, and the indirect cause of millions more. Religious Dogma worms its way into the lives of everyone, religious or not. And if you believe that telling a gay person that their lifestyle is wrong- is in and of itself wrong- then youve indicted religion already. Thats EXACTLY what religion does. So yes, it is stupid. Its a huge portion of everything wrong with the world. It makes people hateful. It keeps people stupid. It keeps people in control. It squashes intelligence and creativity.

It also makes sense since everyone who smokes can relate to the two most common effects which are sleepy and hungry. Also it does not aid in natural dopamine production.

That's partly because Sam had it relatively well off for someone with progeria, and that most people with progeria pass away some time around age 15. Another thing you should be asking yourself is: do Sam's lessons to the world outweigh the fact that he suffered all his life with one of the worst diseases to have? Not the best way for a God to spread his knowledge don't you think?

But, think about what you said. You were saying that the Bible is a teaching tool. It is, but not for everyone. God doesn't just want to hand you omniscience. That's what he did with Lucifer, and Lucifer tried to pretty much overthrow him. So God is using Sam as a way to provide at least if not there devotion, then at least some beauty into their lives. Am I saying Sam deserves this disease? Fuck no, does God believe Sam deserves it? No, but Sam is doing great things for a lot of people. Even if he has suffered from it. He's done God's wish and will be rewarded later. I know it's harsh. I truly do. But Sam's misfortunes will not go without justification. If you still don't believe me I'm fine with that.

Just saying god is the father of everything is 100% dependent on faith and counts as shamelessly sitting on the fence because you want to sound intelligent and spiritual at the same time. Biology and spirituality are mutually exclusive, there is no reason to believe in god other than the fact that you were convinced there is one (probably at a young age), and almost every biological question has already been, or is soon to be explained by us mere humans.

Every day I have to survive my mind because every night, when it gets quiet I'm visited by this emotion. This feeling, and it only lasts for a very brief moment.\nI can't explain exactly what it feels like, what the experience is, but it's bad. It's dark, dry and void. It's a feeling of dark metaphysical closure, an answer. An unrelenting anthropocosmic understanding of my collected human experience.¬†\nImagine a void like a colorless grey box filled with static that's surrounding you flowing through your meridian, rapidly taring apart your existence and separating you from reality. That's the best I can describe it, and trust me, it still doesn't do it justice. Not even slightly.\nIt's almost like being crushed down and stuffed inside a tiny box, and every day a veil grows between you and everyone else. Like there's something separating you from the rest of the world. Every day, this veil grows thicker and every day I become more and more disconnected. I thought moving to first shift would help this somehow. I was wrong.\nAnd it's getting worse, it's happening more often, and eventually I'm going to be fucked. I've caused this, and I know this but I've been dealing with it as best I can, but now my best isn't enough and eventually I'm going to lose and when I do I'm dead. That much I do know.\nI'm going to be dead and nobody will ever have even truly known me. I think I've somehow acknowledged this as a fact and once I eventually learn to accept it, that's when It'll be game over. And never in my life has this feeling been so welcoming, so fucking alluring. I'm starting to actually want it. The good days are what keep me going. And every day is a good day, but even my best days are getting darker and I've had more than my fair share of darkness, both literally and mentally.\nI just hope I don't run out of music. What the fuck is wrong with me.\nThe worst part about this whole situation is, the happier I become, the more devastating the apposing emotion is. I become so happy some days that I guess I'm just destined to fall into depression, and the happier I become, the more devastating the outcome. If that makes any sense. I have to remain in a perpetual state of melancholy, because if I don't, I break down. I can't experience happiness because if I do, my mind will break down and I'll snap. The happier I become, the closer I get to that breaking point\nThis isn't a fucking game. It's serious, and it's very, very punishing and unrelenting.

Things like stiff joints and hip dislocations that occur in some cases can be pretty painful, that I know first hand due to having arthritis and a shoulder that loves to dislocate on my end. Tightening and stiffening of the skin can also happen which has got to be uncomfortable at the least and I would imagine painful if it gets too bad. There's a few other thinks progeria causes that could be painful or at the least hard on a kid. Now, I do dare say he likely suffered from physical pain less than I do daily (Lot of health issues including fibromyalgia and back injuries here, some days suck) but for a kid to have that be the only life they knew, I imagine it wore on him a bit. Knowing very few people with his illness live to see 20 couldn't have helped his emotional state either.\n\nSo yeah, he likely didn't struggle and suffer as much as a lot of people in the comments may assume but he life was no cake walk either.

However this planet is his kingdom for the time being. God can stop this entity at any time, in fact God could have stopped Satan before he was even created him since he knew this would happen. That then begs the question why didn't he? Now I want you to stop for a second and read very carefully and think about what you are about to read since the answer to this question is not simple, if it were people wouldn't be asking. ESSAY INCOMING: Imagine a world where there is no sin, where there is no evil where there is no suffering. Now you might say that's what the universe was like before Satan turned evil. You would be wrong though. A true and loving God like ours would never create such a world. Why? Because that world is a fake a world like that can never exist. A word where the only answer to what is your name is your acual name is a lie itself since we have no choice. We have no choice to say the truth or not to say the truth. God gives a choice. A choice to chose not to follow his will. He doesn't want to have a bunch of robots following his orders blindly. Satan was the first to question God's authority. Being second in charge he wanted more. He asked himself why can't I be god? His greed led to his downfall. When Satan and 1/3 of the angels rebelled against God, he could have destroyed them all on the spot. But again that would only prove to be a fake God trying to create a fake world. A world without a choice - a lie. If God had killed Satan then all of the other angels would immediately question his authority. Why kill Satan? He was so holy, number 2 in charge. What did he ever do wrong? Keep in mind they didn't even know what sin was at the time. If God didn't let Satan do as he please he would have created a world of fear where people obeyed him only due to beign scared of being destroyed. It is important to keep in mind that after God created his most favorite world of all (ours) the Devil went to all of the other creatures in the heavens tempting them but the ones on our planet were the ONLY ones that fell into this temptation and this sinned as well. Every single human born today also sins at one point or another in their lives. That is why there is death in this world is because of sin not because God likes death. God can't be there 24/7 and hold our hand and elimite every single bad thing that happens in our lives. That will also be a lie if nothing bad ever happens to anyone. It would be the same as destoying Satan the second he rebelled. Do not worry though all of this will be over very soon. Many prophesies have already been fulfilled and the time will come when God will not tollerate all of this suffering any longer. And at that time every single being in the universe will know that he is right and just. There will be no more suffering and death. The reason I am explain all of this is it makes me sad to hear people blame God for everything bad that happens in their lives when in reality he does so much good for us.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "yordancho"}

Believing in some sort of deity is inherently different from knowing that there is, lets say, gravity. Why? Well, because the existence and effect of gravity is a factual one, with evidence and studies and experiments on in from early science with Newton all the way up until now where it is definitely regarded as a huge, meta-physical fact. Gravity is something that no one questions, and if no one questions it then no one has to believe it.

In this way they are like you in that you would both collectively agree on believing in the Non-existence of 99.9% of proposed deities out there. But that's it. Believe systems are found everywhere, even in you, good sir. To that point, if I were to ask you what gravity is, and how it was caused, you could scour the Earth for the smartest people and end up with no definitive answer because no one has found that out yet.

What I was trying to get across is that if you want to successfully debate the topic of \"Hey, is there some sort of God out there or not?\" then you're going about it the wrong way.\n\nHere's why: There is no evidence for God.\n\nThere is no evidence for Allah.\n\nThere is no concrete, remarkable proof for the existence of any higher power.\n\nWe know this. We ALL know this. There are people who believe in God or Allah or Shiva or Anubis or Odin who know this. If you walk into a Christian Church and ask for evidence of an existing god, and urged them to understand that you meant you wanted actual concrete, indisputable evidence, they would say that they don't have any, but that they believe because the Bible tells them so, or because they feel God's presence, or any of the dozens of other reasons.\n\nWe know there is no evidence of God, and yet regardless of this universal knowledge, pointing out this lack of physical evidence seems to be your entire argument. You may think that it's a strong one, because how can someone believe in something that hasn't been proven? Well, they can do that because believing in something transcends facts, it transcends reason. Believing, by definition, is without proof. So you saying that one can't or shouldn't believe in something because there are no facts to back it up is total bologna because that is actually the only way for someone to believe in something. If there were facts to back up someones beliefs, they wouldn't have to believe it because at that point it would be knowledge. And knowledge is known, not believed in. ¬†\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nYour argument contradicts itself. You demand facts from people who have none, because they believe in the existence of something that they cannot prove to anyone.¬†\n\nYou might as well just ask for facts about who is going to win the Superbowl in 2016. Guess what? You can't. Those facts don't exist. But I'll bet you all the cash in my underwear drawer that die hard sports fans across the country will tell you that their team will win the Superbowl. How could they know this?!?! Are they psychic?!? No. They're not. They don't know it because that knowledge does not exist. They believe it. Now I know this isn't the same thing as believing in a deity, but hopefully it paints a proper picture.\n\nSo by this logic, @NimeniOwens¬†(as I stated before) absolutely does not need to prove the existence of his God because if he did, it wouldn't be a belief system, it would be a set of facts. Now, I realize that you most likely live your life in pursuit of facts and proven knowledge, that is awesome and admirable. But that also means that this way of thinking probably doesn't make sense to you, and that it all just seems ridiculous that billions of people will live their life thinking that something is true when it can't be proven. But that's okay, we don't have to know why people do that, we only need to figure out everything else in the history of the universe.\n\nOne more reason why you should rework your debate platform is that it includes you reducing entire belief systems into childish things, like Santa and the Easter Bunny. Listen man, it's no skin off my nose how you speak of these things, but when you refer to believing in a God as like expecting Santa to come down the chimney it definitely does make you look childish and uneducated. When people are in an argument they are prone to demeaning or making fun of their rivals platform in order to win it. But when people debate, both sides are respectful and educated in their debate points, and don't resort to childish tactics like name calling, slander and of course, Easter-Bunnificaiton.\n\nAlso, no I was not referring to you having information \"at the ready\" when I said it seemed that everything you said was boarder line at the top of your lungs. I was trying to say that with all the CAPS and BOLDED LETTERS it actually seems that you're yelling all of this at everyone. Just fyi.\n\nP.S. Have you read the Ontological Argument?

You may not have seen that over your seemingly blind hatred for anything pro-higher power, but I have actually been trying to help you realize that your argument needs work. (please note that while I know you've had much experience commenting on hundreds of other YouTube videos about the strikingly obvious fact that there is no God, I chose to use the exact words \"level-headed\" to separate you from my generalization of the \"seasoned debater.\" In short, I do not mean you.) \n\nYou are one whom, at this point in your life, seem to be unable to have an open-minded view on this religious debate platform that you hold so dearly (And by \"open-minded \" I actually mean open-minded in all regards, not just \"non-Christian\"). This being  so, I choose to not debate this point further with you, because I feel as if it isn't going anywhere. \n\nLet me be perfectly clear, however. I have not been trying to make you believe in a higher power at all. I'm not trying to debunk the science in which you hold your beliefs. I am not attacking you or trying to say that your world view is wrong. I have been trying to show you that your argument is flawed and if you want to keep fighting this good fight, then you should change gears a bit here. You might make a shark of a lawyer, a good one too, but you'll never be a Descartes or Aquinas. \n\nYou are trying to prove, through logic and reason, that your beliefs are true, and those two were some of the best in history at doing that. My question about the Ontological was actually a test, and your response means that you failed. The Ontological is regarded as being the height of logical reason for people at that time. It is a landmark in philosophy history. Every great debater of life and origin can cite and respect it's significance, and using the word \"pathetic\" to describe it, it seems that you do not. \n\nI will no longer have this debate with you, because asking you to think differently, in this stage of your life, is like asking gravity to let me go from this Earth.

{"cid": "Ugh1AOcR6diCl3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-U_Zh7-OlcAfSced", "text": "@James Omahony¬†my apologies, I should have wrote in a less objective manner, I didn't mean to come off as condescending or rude. @Emily Johnson¬†in regards to your comments, I would just like to add the following. It is up to society to decide on what values are important (or not important). What money does is enable us ¬†to do exactly so. Many people value material goods because of the significance our society puts on them. But saying \"material goods\" is just as misleading. Truly anything and everything is a \"material good\". Maybe these \"material goods\" have become less practical and more stylish but nonetheless there is meaning and voting happening behind the scenes by both you and the rest of consumers in our economy. One could make the argument however, that these \"stylish materials\" are just as powerful in regards to being a piece of art than the art that is so readily defended by you and others. But the reason why money is so powerful is because it doesn't lie. If a \"good\" or \"service\" is not producing value for other human beings, (if a material object has no significance or purpose to people) the ability to sustain production of that good/service is dependent on purchases. This simple idea means that people that are performing services such as these art(s) you cited can get real feedback on the how valuable it is to others. And if it's not producing value, than the resources wasted can't be justified. Going back to the point that we have \"scarcity\" not abundance of resources. And I'd like to elaborate even further on this. When you say \"gives meaning\" you must realize that there is \"meaning\" behind material, even if it is simply embellishment of oneself. We communicate sensually, and part of those senses is sight. So conveying a message no doubt even through material creates an emotional experience which can translate to meaning when interpreted through a different perspective. Lastly @James Omahony¬† I am not attacking you, I am attacking the statement you made that money is the problem. Money is merely a means to an end, but an efficient one when concerning subjective values in an economy. To acquire money you must provide value to society. It forces us to be productive beings knowing we can attain it and use it to acquire those goods and services that we individually value. And if people value TEDx, people will request more of it, people will pay for it, and people will even demand it. This notion can be applied to almost all services and products in an efficient economic system.¬†", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Edward R."}

I will attempt to recreate it.\n\nI started off explaining how I only commented in the first place because of how rude you were to James Omahony, and then thanked you for apologizing to him.¬†\n\nWe live in a society where the motto seems to be that \"more is never enough\". We may buy that Mercedes we have been dreaming of for 3+ year, but 1 month after we get it we become disappointed and develop new dreams of getting the next model newer. We never fully appreciate the success of reaching our goals, because once we reach them we always want more, or better, or newer.¬†\n\nI think it is very important that more people develop a mindset of appreciating what they do have. They might not have the nicest house on their street, but it is their house, it has running water, electricity, and enough space for them and their family. Sure, the countertops need replacing, the floors need to be refinished, and that box TV needs to be upgraded, but enjoy the nuances, find beauty in the rough floors, admire the strangeness of the out of date countertops‚Ä¶ it won't last forever.¬†\n\n\"Many people value material goods because of the significance our society puts on them\".¬†\nExactly. But I do not agree with your statement: \"truly everything and anything is a material good\".¬†\nA material good is one that is just that, materialistic.. tangible in nature.¬†\n\nImagine for a moment that you are standing in a tropical forest where no humans have made their mark, no talking, no cars, no pollution, just the wind, the birds, and the creaking of the trees. Does this not have value? It most defiantly is not a material good. But most would say this type of beauty has value.¬†\n\nI saw a funny cartoon the other day‚Ä¶ It was actually a Retweet from Boogie, which read: \"Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.\"¬†\nThe US has a greater GDP than Bhutan‚Ä¶ but Bhutan doesn't focus on production and profits‚Ä¶ they focus on GNH: Gross National Happiness. The US has a higher rate of depression than Bhutan, but we're richer so that must mean we're better! Right?\n\nI think most people would place a bigger priority on happiness than goods or services they consume. If a I had a choice between being the parent of a poor family with 5 kids living in a 2 bedroom apartment with a positive outlook on life and experiencing pure happiness‚Ä¶ or being the parent of a excessively rich family with 2 perfect straight A students living in a mansion in Beverly Hills who is consistently severely depressed‚Ä¶ I would choose the former.¬†\n\nThis scenario is probably more likely than most people think. We live in a society that tells us: \"the more you have, the happier you'll be\". But as everyone who is anyone has experienced in their life, that new toy you really wanted for Christmas, or that new car you were dreaming of for 3+ years, it didn't make you any happier in the long run. It just increased the level of your goals in the future.¬†", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Emily Johnson"}

(This is not about god vs atheist please take that debate elsewhere)\nTo think life's only purpose is death is a rather sad thought, causes depression in those who believe their lives will revert back to what it was like before you were born. It wasn't a very memorable experience before you born was it? Imagine being in that realm of non-existence for all eternity, it makes those think their life is pointless and I'm only here to tell you my thoughts on life and why you should cherish it. I did believe in some form of reincarnation for the longest time, because there is something else to us that gives us life. Without getting into god vs atheist I won't call it a soul but there is something behind life we don't fully understand. If you connected a brain, lungs, heart ect. and pumped blood through it then tried to stimulate the brain into working order nothing would happen. This is where life energy, chi or a soul comes into question. Now according to scientific research energy cannot be destroyed, energy can only transfer or spread (thin-out). There is a natural energy to our body and mind that is believed to be our soul. When we die our body may be gone but that residual energy will... go somewhere (we don't know) maybe that energy contains who you are. However if reincarnation was true what happens when there is no more life on this planet to reincarnate? When this planet dies, becomes destroyed or becomes inhabitable what will happen then?\n\nWith that said I can't truly believe in the \"nothing\" version of afterlife that most of the population believes. That we will revert back to what it was like before we were born, because science shows for every action there is a reaction, cause and effect... and that plays into the idea that there is something beyond this life. Nothing in this universe is pointless, and for mankind to simply revert back to that realm of non-existence again for all eternity would be pointless. Maybe Star Wars was right, maybe there is a force that binds all living things together. We are not independent individuals, we need others to survive when we are born and when we grow we long for companionship, we need each other in this world and we would need each other in the next one. Maybe by simply existing we created something in universe, something or somewhere we go to after we pass away. And what is this force that binds us? How do we grow emotions for each other. What baffles me the must is, how does a planet have every thing it needs in order for life to be here? The O-Zone layer, the perfect distance from the sun so its not too hot or too cold, the molten lava under our crust keeping our planet warm during nighttime, plants that provide our air, a natural system that causes rain to supply these plants with the very thing they need to survive and a protective atmosphere which shields us from gases and meteors/debris. So many things needed for life to grow yet here it is despite all odds stacked against it. Maybe there is something greater out there we don't understand... for our perspective is our greatest illusion, it made us think the planet was flat and that our planet was the center of the universe. Who knows what illusions we continue to see.\n\nIt's these things that make me disbelieve the theory that we got back to that realm of non-existence couldn't be true. You cannot go back to the way things were before you born, it's impossible... you can't undo your existence, to revert back to that state is impossible because you are here right now. And our body and minds may be destroyed but our energy would live on for eternity. And as we are drawn to each other in this world energy is no different, we bind to each other like molecules. And maybe those bonds we form here continue on after our bodies are gone. Maybe that energy goes back to the place it came, back to the stars. Maybe this is only a stepping stone into life. Maybe our end here is just the beginning to something greater. Because we can't know for sure that's why it's best to live this life as much as you can. And I mean that, you waited 4.5 billion years to be here... and when you die if there is something else beyond this life the only things you'll be able to take with you is your thoughts, your memories and your personality. Money, cars, houses, jewelry and all that trash will remain here for it is not important. The important things in life are family, friends, loved ones, experiencing new things, learning, growing and exploring. Seek out all you can here, experience as much as you can while you're here. You really want a lifetime of working long hours to be your in-flight movie to your next life? It would be a pretty boring movie.Ôªø\nShow less", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "nigggala"}

I said it doesn't do most of the work.Really, it is only the ozone layer that helps to absorb a relatively small amount of UV rays from the sun. (The ozone layer does not trap heat, btw. It absorbs UV rays. Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases traps heat. And it traps it from the solar radiation, not from lava.) Our core does the vast majority of the work of protecting our planet. We have a molten iron core. It literally creates a magnetic shield that extends far above the atmosphere.\n\n2. The core of the earth most certainly does not warm the atmosphere. The only reason why we have the atmosphere we have today, is not because of the hot lava, but because of the gases released from volcanic eruptions, and from meteor impacts for a couple of billion years.\n\n3. \"We don't know what harmful gases come near our planet.\" Uuuhhh....there is really no \"harmful gases\" that are coming to the earth. The \"harmful stuff\" is called \"radiation.\" It's not a gas. And we know what it is. We have known for literally over a century now. And it comes from the sun, and a small amount from the rest of the universe. The reason why the rest of the universe does not contribute more radiation to our solar system, is simply because the sun, like the earth, has a vast magnetic field because of the vast amount of iron in the sun. Only the sun is many, many times larger than the earth, and therefore, it's magnetic field reaches out to the furthest reaches of our solar system. (Not quite, but it's reach is quite far out there.)\n\n4. \"We don;t know much about our own galaxy.\" Except that we know just as much about our galaxy as we do the universe itself. Our galaxy is in the universe, afterall. The great scientific mysteries that we are currently studying, is not about our galaxy, but the universe as a whole. We are studying \"dark energy\" and \"dark matter.\"\n\n5. \"The core of the earth's temperature matches that of the surface temperature on the sun.\" Yes. It does.\n\n6. \"That heat rises and goes to the top, it gets cooler the further it goes but it does provide a difference in our temperature at night.

That is not at all how our planet-wide ecosystem works. A small amount of lava escaping around the planet does not heat the planet at night.

Listening to his perspective was helpful for me to realize that I can have a better personal attitude about my own health problems that keep me from doing what I wish sometimes.That I can also do work-arounds and hold an attitude to take advantage of what I can do and focus less on what I can't. Find folks that are uplifting and supportive to be around. Keep \"moving forward\", as best as you can enjoying life while you can. Good advice from anyone, IMO. His having overcome such difficult life obstacles makes him more worthy of listening to because of knowing that he has \"been there\".
