Video doesn't need to be 11mins explaining your journey, mindset, and how many free beers and hookers you got at google.  \nAlso, the majority of people quit because they are well off already.  \nIf you had a 100k student loan debt and got a job offered at google, the majority would stay at google for a long time.  \n99% of videos like this on youtube that says \"why I quit X\" are just a bunch of people who never had to even work day to day to meet ends meet. Only a silverspoon baby would've quit.  \nWhy don't you tell us about all your assets, investments, and other sources of income that you fail to mention?"}

{"text": "@John Michael Godier First of all, what sort of evidence are you looking for that will prove that to you? Ancient statues of alien overlords? alien weaponry that has somehow shown to be from another planet? An old written account on papyrus?  Second of all, there are a LOT of places on this earth that are largely unexplored, the bottom of the ocean, huge underground crevices, dont get me started on the arctic circles, also you seem to assume that if any \"evidence of an alien invasion\" was anywhere to be found it would be reported on cnn and you would definitely know about it. Keep in mind that this earth is very old, and only a very small part of that timeline is somewhat documented , erosion and plate tectonics among other things might have completely destroyed cultures much older than you can conceive of. There are plenty of life forms that dwell on this planet that have yet to be discovered and even the ones we have discovered still baffle scientists and dont fit the so-called \"evolutionary tree\". Also what makes you so sure that an alien race would be your size, have your ambitions, the need to \"invade\" , there are life forms and civilizations at different scales. There are plenty of sightings that are unexplained, not just by \"conspiracy nuts\" but by proffesional people as well unless you just want to write them off as crazy people. You need to be a little more humble and consider that you dont know what you don't know instead of being arrogant like black science man, robot on wheelchair(rip) or guy with bowtie and a lab coat. How can you make a video saying \"its nowhere to be found\" since you yourself have not looked inside every single crevice of this earth?"}
