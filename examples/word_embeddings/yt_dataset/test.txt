Can you please provide tutorial link for Pytest framework with Selenium Automation...
Cars should have a single touch screen that integrates radio, AC, heating, engine mode etc and should be a single telemetry system that monitors the car's systems just like a jet fighter. No need to have buttons and your hands never leave the steering wheel.

The main problem I have with modern, computer managed engines is that while they operate very efficiently and produce low emissions when they are new and all their components and sensors are functioning properly, when a component goes bad, the OBD2 system is piss poor at identifying the failed component, many times doesn't even recognize that the engine isn't operating properly, and, in some cases, the computer's corrections to poor emissions exacerbate the problem. OBD2 came out in '96 IIRC and is still the standard today. It is disgraceful that the industry is still running firmware rooted in a 33 year old standard. First off, manufacturers should provide USB test ports or bluetooth conectivity on their Engine Control, Brake Control, and Transmission Control Modules so that they can be fully tested using a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Secondly, manufacturers should be required to make software or apps to test these modules available for free. Third, manufacturers should be required to make all factory service manuals and technical bulletins available online for free. Fourth, all model years of a manufacturer's vehicles should be graded on their emissions every year. In states like CA where vehicles must undergo smog testing every two years, the state should make aggregated test results available to the pubic and should include failed tests in the results. For example, one might look up the test results for a 1997 Ford Mustang equipped with a 4.6L V8 and see what percentage of such vehicles passed smog testing and what their average emissions were each test year. This would give the state, car buyers, and manufacturers valuable feedback on how well these engines, their control modules, and the various sensors were designed and built. My thought is that a modern, computer controlled, fuel injected engine has very low emissions when new, but as it ages, certain sensors and components begin to wear and develop errors that are within the allowable thresholds of error for the ECM and do not cause a check engine light, but do allow increased emissions and possibly even a poorly running engine. Fifth, the standards for vehicle emissions controls need to be revised. I'm not sure to what extent manufacturers have improved their improved their engine management approaches over the years because I'm still driving a '97 Mustang. I find it particularly disturbing that each four-cylinder bank of my V8 relies on one oxygen sensor upstream of the Cat to determine if the computer should lean or enrich the A/F mixture to that bank of cylinders. Suppose one of those four cylinders has a partially clogged fuel injector and the other three cylinders are operating perfectly. The computer detects that the bank is running lean and richens the A/F mixture to all four cylinders. Now I'll have three cylinders all running a bit too rich and the bad cylinder still running lean. This results in much higher hydrocarbon emissions that the cat has to burn off, will damage the cat more than before the "correction" made to the A/F mixture, may result in more tailpipe emissions, and results in the engine running worse and decreased MPG. Similarly, if the bad cylinder had a loss of spark due to a fouled plug, a bad plug wire, or a bad coil, the computer will errantly enrichen the A/F ratio with the same results. The obvious solution is that the A/F ratio should be controlled individually for each cylinder. The downside is that now the car has to be built with a header that has an O2 sensor on each downpipe and the PCM has to run eight channels of A/F ratio control instead of two channels. This will increase vehicle cost for the extra O2 sensors, wiring, the more complex PCM, and the header. It may also pose packaging problems to fit in the headers. The upside is that if one cylinder has a problem, it is more easily detected and reported, the computer can effect a correction on only the bad cylinder(s), and the problem can be more easily diagnosed and corrected resulting in fuel savings, a better running engine, less damage to the Cat, and lower tailpipe emissions. That is a tradeoff that I, as a consumer would be happy to accept.
So are all "Made in China" products will be stopped too?? coz we all know majority are made in China literally

I can speak English very well, but I don't have any English friend to talk with me or help with me 🤔 Could someone help me please?
now I come up with conclusions. Every teacher has their own method, raymond murphy teaching grammar by a books, A.J Hoge teaching grammar and speaking by an audios, then you said learning english would be inefficient either by using books only or audios only, and you came with another new ideas, imitation. That was great, but I bet we will see articles or videos something like this again. great video! sorry for my bad english

Lots of new cars (especially crossovers) have chrome rectangles on the rear bumper to imitate a big exhaust, often you can even see see a cheap plastic cover plate in the middle of them.

@Slaik bro , u seem to miss the point , no one is mad cause americans cant use huawei phones anymore, the same way that no one cares if chinese ppl dont use certain products anymore , the rest of the world doesnt care simply , but when things get passed the US/china , then ppl get mad , in this case , the US didnt even ban huawei for the US , they banned it for the whole fucking world , china never did that
Led headlights, led backlights, led fucking everything. Led is ugly except when used on screens
@bogoljub djordjevic - please clarify your comment. What is the US stomping it's leg into the ground over that they did not get their way with?
I for one will be supporting them by buying all their products from now on. Will not buy American products anymore. FUCK THE US

there is one thing that underlies everything...everything...and that thing is potential, everything has the potential to be something else, a tree has the potential to be a house, the furniture in the house, a pencil on the furniture in the house, or left alone has the potential to be a mighty god of the forest, a home to birds, insects and other animals, potential is the catalyst for change, that same potential is in all of us... Arise ye for mans life is short and the great work remains incomplete, arise ye builders of cities, hewers of worlds and master architects of the universe, for you are the Magnum Opus and only you can complete it, arise ye and know thy self for you are the master piece of creation.

herranton1979. I'm not talking about the parking brake, I'm talking about the emergency brake, two different things. The emergency brake is usually a small pedal on the left. My 2008 Prius had an emergency brake that saved me when my brakes failed, a pedal on the left. Most modern cars have power brakes that are electrically operated. If the power fails, as was the case in my Prius, the brakes will no longer work.

How is that any of your business? In that case is their decision,not yours.
I do care about price. Which is why I got my note 9 for 150 switching to t-mobile on black Friday. The note was 900 and get 750 off. Could've gotten any phone I wanted same deal. IPhone xr free or 6t for free or 750 off any other phone. After a good amount of time using each phone in the store the note 9 was was no minor winner.

Car manufactures need to build infotainment units with free software updates. I believe Tesla is the only manufacturer that is leading the way in this respect. Car manufactures are missing an opportunity to keep the existing customers by not supporting them after they make a purchase. Auto makers are so used to disregarding a client after they buy a car. They're only focus is on continually getting new customers. But as car builders continue to in corporate more tech they will need to upgrade their products after a client makes a purchase. Software grades are already common place to smart phones, printers, video cards, and cameras just to name a few. I just go a Mazda 2018 CX 5 and it does not have Android auto or Apple car play. Mazda will retrofit their 2014 - 2018 vehicles with these apps for $443CDN. This is a total slap in the a face to their current customers. They reduce the price of the upgrade on their poorer selling vehicles like the Mazda 6. I would have been a lifetime Mazda customer if it made their software upgrade free and charged labour for installing a USB connector. Now after signing the dotted line I feel like I am not being supported by Mazda like I would from a tech manufacture. I am sure Mazda is not the only auto company behaving like this and the auto industry needs to provide software upgrades as they continue to incorporate more tech in vehicles.

Before you know it the Xbox two will be released before you win.

I hate the fact that I have to pull a lever inside my car to open my gas cap. I know why that is, but the lever is placed in a spot that's out of sight AND next to a lever to pop the hood. I have popped my hood accidentally on multiple occasions when stopping to get gas. I don't think popping the hood of my car should be a common mistake when trying to put gas in my car.
This is so sad i wanted to buy their mate book x pro fr my wife but now it looks like i will buy the surface book 2
Awesome! All the best. Let me know how you go with this tutorial. I'd love some feedback.

Thank you very much for this. This is really great :)
Hey man! I just watched your video in 2018 and its amazing! I am 15 and this really helps a lot. creds to you man
So would I be correct in saying that China didn't ban Google apps from their people first ? Yes you can say Huawei isn't the Chinese government until you look into who Huawei are.so now the question is who were the biggest douchebags first. Youll find that that is the Chinese government.

Huawei OS (plan B) is 100% compatible with Android. Huawei never get a chance to use Huawei OS because of the popularity of Android and customers love Android. But the Huawei ban is an EXCELLENT opportunity to introduce Huawei OS and re-integrate the Huawei supply chain for both hardware and software. Well, thank President Trump. Huawei store has all kinds of the Google store apps without using Google services.
And how many fatal accidents have happened because of human driving?

1. At least in Europe, just about every single low-mid segment model has as standard 17" alloy wheels with rear DRUM brakes and torsion beam. You can count the exceptions on fingers of one hand. 2. Dashboard "welcoming" and "goodbyeing" is pure lobotomy. 3. Plastic headlights, and pressurized detergent sprayers/cleaners which use exactly 5x more liquid than ones for windshield, btw clean next to nothing. 4. Xenon light prices, 1500$ a piece on average. Halogen bulbs cost 5-10$ for BOTH sides, even less. 5. No bonnet anymore has any air openings close to the windshield, so in the winter warm air could melt down some snow or ice. 6. Moonroof has never been more expensive as an option, especially electric ones. Bullshit panorama glass roofs often cost more than whole rest of the car by the time it is 5-6y old. 7. Electric gas pedals and 1s response delay because "ecology"... 8. Electricaly operated steering wheels. 9. No oil dipstick in BMW, just screen that says "OK". 10. Dual turbos, 2 in 1 housing module, when one brakes, you pay a change of both.
Samsung will be putting in backups now for sure just incase this happens to them.

It's actually better to not buy a car and simply move walking distance from work and shopping and purchase to self a bicycle. I haven't had a car in 5 years and I haven't needed to take the bus or a taxi yet. I have an e-bike. Nowadays you can have your groceries delivered to your house and purchase everything from eBay or Amazon.

if it stays up for 50 days the charging process to fill it up must be hell though........
The manufacturer of the phone must be proud their product is discussed in the unbox therapy.
Hey Lew correct if i'm wrong , but i think Apple moved their assembly line to India , dont know if that move was made or it's about to happen

@Abhi Patel So I'm stubborn for pointing out that their testing methodology was flawed? I care about picture quality and compression because I'm not utterly clueless, however I don't care what random people on Instagram or Facebook think is or isn't a good picture. No, what the test proved is that flawed methodology judged by people who mostly know nothing about camera quality will produce weird results, I'll stick with DxOMark if I need to know about camera quality not a bunch of clueless social media users.
this was filmed in July, So the Grand Sport wasn't officially on sale yet for MT to get one in pure production form.

I feel like calling the GT350R a muscle car is a little unfair, considering how capable it is. A car that's faster than the likes of the NSX, GT-R, and 911 around Laguna Seca is way outside the usual "fast, as long as you don't have to turn" muscle car characterization.

The OnePlus6T wins because of its price, it provides flagship performance for much less than flagship price. However if you are willing to spend that kind of money on a phone and want the absolute bang for your buck, then the you are right, the Note9 and Mate20 Pro have no competition.

Thank goodness I'm not the only one who hates the SUV trend! I live in Cornwall which is a very popular tourist and retirement location, which is fine except they all drive either hire cars or the big 4x4s. Now on the main roads that's not really an issue, but as soon as you go off the beaten track you're screwed. Every local who doesn't work in agriculture or fishing will tell you to get a hatchback as they can easily get down those narrow lanes, as most of them have pull ins to let other cars pass, especially if you're willing to accept the odd small scratch here or there. However with the large SUVs that's borderline impossible, especially if they don't want to get too near to the hedgerows. It's even worse with hire cars as they clearly don't want to scratch them at all. But to top it all off I've driven SUVs myself and they're about as exciting to drive as watching paint dry. I love my little Ford it's just so peppy and fun to drive. Plus all the parts are so cheap and easy to replace it's unbelievable. I miss the days when I was growing up when everyone had Golf GTis or other hot hatchbacks. They were so good
that makes no sense, 29 people must have a brain tumor.

So if I was to buy a phone that was made at the start of the year by Huawei would it not have Google apps
I use gesture control on a daily base, mainly to shuffle through my songs. Display key only used once or twice. Now it's just laying in the wireless charging pad in the car. And what's wrong with lane departure warning? If the technology is on point it works great! Spare tires are so 2006.
