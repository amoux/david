If future Huawei devices can run Google's apps if the customer installs those services manually, would Huawei be allowed to provide setup instructions in the box or on-screen instructions after the initial setup process, for how to get these services?
how are you getting the code from the text in the top right to have results that appear on the console? nothing i am doing is making that happen. they just act separately.

I drive my Sierra Denali as a daily driver. I don't haul shit every day. Besides gas mileage its one of the best vehicles I have owned. Great in snow we take it to ski mountains. All the wet skis stay in the covered bed. No mess in a carpeted SUV and no seats to put down. Don't need a roof box. We go to the beach and all the sand from coolers and stuff stays in the bed. I go fishing and its the same thing, mess is in the bed and I can hose it out. If I need mulch I have a truck. If I go to home depot once a year I have a truck. If I need to move something I have a truck. Best vehicle for weekend warriors ever. Sucks as a grocery getter. The bags roll around and shit gets everywhere. Bought a couple of cheap laundry baskets to use for groceries and loose items.

joe woodchuck I wouldn‚Äôt worry, in 10 years cars will be so expensive only the very rich will be able to afford them. Most people will walk, pedal their bikes, public transport, or hourly car rentals. Germany already has car rentals accessible by smart phones at 15 cents per minute
The fuck is wrong with you? Simpler in the aspect that they are actually affordable and you get to see them on the road once in a while. Didn't say that was a bad thing.
Omg yes! I cant stand the giant grilles!!! Hit the nail on the heads with these Scotty, i agree with them all!!
This is a big blow to Huawei smart phone business. Never expected US will use such a dirty tactic to kill off competitor. Using power of the state, and president's executive to fight a company??! This proof only one thing, Huawei is damp fxxking good.

Hello Mosh - At first thanks a lot for this opportunity to learn something i thought was rocket science - I am totally new to coding. In your video about asking 2 questions - name and color - i used the below code - name = input("what is your name? ") print(' Hi ' + name) color = input("What color do you like? ") print(name + " likes " + color + " color") But when the 2nd Question was asked - the cursor was on 1st character of the statement "What color do you like? " i.e next to "W" Can you please advise how to correct this? Thanks, Manish
Hi Mosh , any idea why when I try add products/ to Django page I get an error , ie no Hello World. I checked the code was the same as in the video, but the error message in terninal is to do with line 21 in urls.py . anyone else having this problem?
Don't be surprised - 110 years ago Ford's Model T got 21 miles per gallon

Should i have any programming or coding background before starting this course?
If you're new to programming you should probably take interactive courses that explain things from the beginning (what variables are and such) on for example codecademy. Understanding what is happening under the hood is very important to debugging and you won't remember much unless you get your hands dirty. This tutorial is meant for people who probably already know a couple of programming languages and are just looking for a quick overview of syntax and common operations before beginning to use it for their own purposes. You should first consider if you need to learn python at all. Here are some applications to python: https://www.python.org/about/apps/
@Wyatt Stav Definitely... It's people giving root access to apps, side loading unverified apps and just not understanding how bad they are exposing themselves to attacks that cause 99% of it.

I'd say 6t. But at the same time the camera on the mate 20 pro could be enough to make it number 1.
Its funny how making a nice well explained video like this can teach millions of people how to code all for free.
Apparently, some people are never happy no matter what you give them! 6 hours of high-quality content with exercises, solutions, projects and cheat sheets are not good enough for them! In fact, the video is so bad that it deserves a dislike! lol
yeye, it's because you are missing some spaces in some line, it can happen. you need to space the words like when you finish defining a function .
I had to laugh about your remark about fin's on car's, in the past. I have a 59 Cadillac and in those days we were on our way to the moon, and we just had to have fin's and rocket engine's coming from the back of our cars in those days,,,,,But at least in those days the cars really were beautiful with some colors, and also if they had a certain two-tone paint scheme. Some of the two-tones just really looked nice with the stainless steel trim,,,,,,,
I installed Google camera on both my Note 8 and my S10+ and it's truly amazing. I use the Samsung camera app for videos but any still pictures I use the Google. It's definitely better than the Samsung software for pictures, and night sight works and the wide angle works as well.... Definitely A+

Yes, but for no good reason. Over 85% of my viewers are male. Some people think it is because of marketing in the past that focused on selling computers to boys, but that was about 20 years ago. Some jobs to seem to be better suited to different sexes. I just saw a study that showed that female doctors were found to be considerably better then men on average.
I HATE SUVs!!! Hate them! Give me a sedan any day. The other thing that seems silly is this crazy trend for bigger and BIGGER trucks. Are you kidding me. How many people actually need something that's almost getting to the size of a bus? Very few...but it's all about ego. Hell, why not scrap all these monster vehicles and just make tanks. Then we can have tank wars with each manufacturer out doing the other.
@logan Wiseley lol I am not biased everyone else is. The pixel does not have the best camera if it cant take good videos and only simple stills that I can easily get on my S10 which frankly is a better camera why would I want to spend 900 on this loaf of garbage.

‚Äã@J L I know, which means you can't attract females anymore. Mankind is doomed. I'd like to let my back slide too, but I give that up for the comfort of an electric handbrake. And the extra space it gives me in the center console. I think I'm getting old. Though if you have rear wheel drive and enough power, you absolutely can drift without a handbrake. :)
@Robert Hardy the difference is Chinese companies are still allowed to interact with Google,Facebook etc. A usual citizen can bypass the firewall using vpn too. But the US ban is very serious and anybody or any company from US is banned from interacting with Huawei
Probably the worst trend is the complicated touch-screen where you have to look at and navigate a menu screen to do basic functions like turn on the climate control or adjust the radio. Where is the difference between this and texting while driving? Automatic transmissions in all their forms are dangerous in that the driver no longer has to concentrate and anticipate road conditions , especially when the automatic often shifts into an entirely inappropriate gear, dumping lots of torque where a gentle nudge is all that is needed. An experienced driver with a manual can use the throttle, clutch and the selective sliding gears to adjust precisely to the road conditions. And who needs fake engine noise when I can hear my neighbors' Mustangs and Challengers and Camaros and Chargers coming three blocks away?

Maybe the 90's were even the pinnacle of the whole Western society? Housing was still affordable, we had stay-at-home-moms, I mean kids saw their parents for more than 2 hours a day, you didn't need a 5 year degree for a decent job, cars were pretty reliable (I miss our Hondas)...
I miss the days of big batteries like the ZeroLemon case/battery combo I had for my S4. The phone was more comfortable to hold and lasted a very long time. Not to mention I could replace the battery myself in just a few minutes if it started to tank. I don't understand the fascination with glass backs and thin phones. What a waste.
@Nate Eintracht I quoted the video, you are paraphrasing. Anyway the actual article goes into far more detail about the F-type, and you are partially right. Once it was fixed they really liked it. They said "Had this SVR shown up in 2013 or 2014, it might have enjoyed a podium finish." So even a few years ago when the competition wasn't so fierce it would have placed 2nd or 3rd...but not 1st, and that's why it didn't place well in this competition. Keep in mind even a slightly improved version last years winner placed 6th in this years competition. That is how good the field was.

It has gotten more expensive AND slower than previous versions. The "GTR thing" was that it was a relatively cheap supercar killer. Now it is not cheap anymore, and other (cheaper) cars are faster.
The no sound, is what I love the most about it.
In short : Someone (T) wants domination over the world. Seems like targetting China and/or Huawei, but think back......

"Who's the Boss?! "

I think touch screens are one of the dumbest things now. You have to focus on aiming your finger at the right spot on flat screen, that you forget to pay attention to the road. Real buttons are safer, cause you can feel them out before pressing. You don't need to take your eyes away from the road. I also don't like keyless entry and start/stop buttons. What's wrong with turning key to start/stop the engine?

Actually it is cool to omit google services as they accumulate personal data and give it to foreign intelligence. What is cool is open source android and the creation of independent developer fraternity that displace the need of google services, in a more transparent and unintrusive way.......unlike current google practices. This should be the trend from the beginning. We have been giving tremendous revenue opportunity to google by being the product for google's interest. Huawei is targetted as they are leading 5g implementation and US capitalist is not happy as they are not making money out of that first.

Warning! This tutorial is not a good Python tutorial. It is clearly written by someone who comes from a Java/C++ background, and misuses Python constructs that they confuse for constructs from those languages. For example, it uses double-underscore name-mangling, i.e. things like `self.__myvar = myvar` , but this is *not meant to be used like a private access modifier*. You just do `self.myvar = myvar` in Python, or, if you want to signal to people that an attribute is an implementation detail, you use a *single underscore*. Second, the tutorial creates a bunch of class variables, that are immediately shadowed by instance variables in the initializer. This is totally pointless, and can lead to subtle bugs. Finally, a `toString` method? Use `__str__` in Python, and then you can just `print(instance)` or `str(instance)`. Again, clearly someone is coming from Java or C++.
Lew, could you talk about why companies are actually taking so much consideration into cameras rather than making great performers for lower prices?

I think the worst trend in modern car design is the tiny sloped rear windows and high beltlines that prevent you from seeing from behind. I still drive my 1995 Integra even though its beat to hell because I can actually see 360 degrees.
A giant camera screen for a windshield could be pretty cool. You could add all kinds of neat info to your view. Highlight objects coming in from blind spots, enhance overall view of the road at night even without headlights. The shiny black plastic isn't just an issue with cars, it's everywhere and needs to stop! TVs come to mind.
Hellcat is best highway roll racing car ever.But for dig runs it just doesn't hook up.One of the only stock cars that probly needs actuall slicks
That was a great talk Lew! It definitely has to be brought up! The competition topic was very interesting! We can clearly see now that those who are the biggest have a great power and responsibility.. It has been quite comfortable to not mix politics when you are in the topic of tech. But now politics is deeply involved in almost every kind of topic. And most of the decision are really not in favour of the people. I believe that companies both hate and love their rivals. But it's important that there is competition, we customers want innovation! But when the government play the power card. That's when someone tries to change the rules. What would the world look like if the biggest companies in the world had a vote about the decision made by the governments? And to be clear as Lew said, it has been a two say street. Both parties have to take responsibility. I think what might happen is that there will enter a new player in the game. That's actually what I hope for, because that will truly be an interesting future.
America is a falling empire, these moves are the only things they have left to rely on. It's just a matter of time before Samsung come to their senses and join forces with Huawei and create their own OS and ecosystem. who is to say that the American government won't come for Samsung if they get to the position Huawei is in. Huawei is it for the long game. Already they have been laying the groundwork all over Africa and Asia and eastern Europe. Google and all western brands are fucked in the long run.

alcantara is really great, its a must for me personally. with leather seats ass is sweaty in the summer and leather is cold in the winter( we actually have winter here) and yeah cloth seats are the solution, but alcantara is just the premium feel on it. i have an 2005 audi a6 with it and its great. steering wheel point is valid though but for the seats, door panels and roof lining it is great in my opinion.
Love the Polar Vantage M on your wrist, been looking for one myself but can't find any decent reviews, hint hint :D
This review and award is only within the U.S or at world level?
I think one of the worst trends is people going to the discount auto parts store and getting the bedazzled Logos. Example why do you need a logo to tell the world that you have 24 inch rims on your car??

Of course, Google also intercepted usernames and passwords while collecting images for Google Maps. Whoopsie... So if anyone knows about using tech the wrong way, they do.... Google good. Huawei bad. ummm okay...
Are you going to ignore China does NOT practice ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù and actively blocks foreign competition?
China is ran by communist party and so is this company...hey lew talk about the Chinese concentration camps for million of muslim in China or how China Spies on every single person in there country and has a ranking system for each and every person
@Chosen1Creator Lifetime should mean human lifetime. Otherwise just give a few years warranty. A company could say lifetime but their phones only last 3 months. "Yeah, our phones lifetime is 3 months, so that's lifetime warranty" Lifetime could be how long your specific phone lasts because that has been its life, so if a company wants to be truly evil, you get no warranty at all.
DNF couldn't stand the level or the "quality" of the music!
A little confusing because when you use the "len" method it counts using the number 1, but if you check the spots of them normally it starts with 0
The winner for the big smart phone should be the Huawei Mate 20 X.
Should I get the Pocophone?, I have a few reservation due to the screen not being AMOLED and Gorilla glass 3 being used. The screen resolution is just not that good as compared to an AMOLED screen. The 845 Ram, 6 GB Ram and the 128gb internal memory at that price are putting me in a bind. Any other alternatives that you would suggest?
Do you make videos like this for laptops too? That would be great.

@Mrwhosetheboss idiot. Don't need to say anymore. Your channel is crap compared to a lot of others.
Talk about stiff competition. The Z06 would have been nice to see here. Not that a Corvette could ever win "best driver's car", but it would be nice to see it give that Viper a run for it's money at Laguna Seca.

@Steven Roland all too true. the problem we have in South Africa is that its a third world country,but yet the consumers are full of it as i see it. but thats a good thing cause here we dont stand for it. you have no idea how many campaigns we have in SA.,for these types of things. ok i worked for German and French manufacturers over the years,work for myself now though lots of high end cars,but still do bread and butter cars too. now im surprised in north america they doing that,cheap,unreliable turbos, but my biggest pet thing i hate,and this is my reason im an AMG guy,BMW Mcars are now using fake engine sounds. if AMG can give us exhaust noise,due to turbos,why cant BMW msport do it? also on the turbo factor,again i also blame consumers for not adhering to manufacturers recommendations. ive used cheap aftermarket turbos for tuning reasons,but kept the boost low enough for reliable running,yet when ran properly,had more than enough kick over the standard car. ive had kinda done a documented study,for myself,on two cars i did. both ran cheap turbos,not badly made though,with over 170,000kms and 195,000kms on it without a hickup. maybe i put it together with reliable running in mind. not one coolant issue,nothing. but they start up and let idle before driving and let it idle again before switching off without revving up in the warm up phase and cool down phase. but great communicating man!!!!
Plz make a tutorial on Terminal in Ubuntu Linux OS. Thnx for the video. It's awesome.

It's about time they put the screws to Huawei they've been stealing intellectual properties for over 20yrs no more now. T-Mobile and Samsung happy what Google did about time.
Couldn't agree more. It's about the all-around enjoyment from McLaren cars. They keep nailing it with no doubt. But man Ford is doing really great job to keep up the game. I'm proud of Ford and the legendary Mustang!
who wants to practice with me? I'm trying to improve it. we can do it on facebook or whatsapp.
For get a job, I need a DEGRREE in IT? Or can I JUST learn by myself?
So a 4 hour video to basically learn nothing except how to print to console...nice. People the only way you will really learn is to read Python documentation cover to cover. Pick an app you want to build and then read the documentation at each step of the process while building it.
US has the most advanced technology in the world. If US want block any IT company, it is very feasible. Just like encountering pirates by patent, Huawei has no word to say and have to accept it. I think that CN government should work together with Europe and Japan to make plan B for an open world, since plan A by US is so unreliable.

Those Chevy commercials drive me nuts! You shouldn't have to show awards to get people to buy things. Prove it! Actions speak louder than words, and Chevy has terrible vehicles. I hate that you don't even need to have the key fob out to get in the car. Just be close and the door will lock or unlock. Auto braking and lane departure systems. I know how to drive, grant it most people don't, but companies are making people dumber!

Hey man, you seem to be knowledgeable in this area, would you mind giving me a hand through pm? Thanks for your time.
Yeah... all the efforts to STOP monopolies... AFTER they were allowed to become monopolies... is evidence that American companies LIKE competition. We were happy to compete with German, and Japanese manufacturing... in August 1945. America likes competition, after it's been destroyed. Now, America is 1940s Japan... and Huawei is Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Guam.

So i made this program using the class function....i would like to know the real usage of the function class in real world application. And also is there a way to get my arguments more simply than using 4 input command in the program bellow...Thank you for the tutorial sir. sorry for bad english :) class student: __name = 0 __location = 0 __age = 0 __subject = 0 def __init__(self,name,age,location,subject): self.__name = name self.__location = location self.__age = age self.__subject = subject def put_name(self,name): self.__name = name def take_name(self): return self.__name def put_location(self,location): self.__location = location def take_location(self): return self.__location def put_age(self,age): self.__age = age def take_age(self): return self.__age def put_subject(self,subject): self.__subject = subject def take_subject(self): return self.__subject def phrase(self): return "Hi I am {} and I am {} years old, I live in {} and I study {} !".format(self.__name, self.__age, self.__location, self.__subject) user = student(input("Enter your name: "),input("Enter your age: "),input("Enter your current location: "),input("Enter the subject you study: ")) print(user.phrase())

I enjoy this tutorial a lot, you are a true genius, I wish you good health!
My MDX has not one, but two LCD screens (plus a mini display between the gauges). One is a touchscreen, the other is controlled by about 50 rotary dials, buttons and thumbwheels. The infotainment system alone has a 281 page owner's manual. It's ridiculous! After spending two days studying the regular 578 page owner's manual I've learned to use the 3 functions I use the most and just pretend the other things don't exist.
Its a serious issue but tech starts from china and ends in china so in my way it would not be as big issue for them, as they know tech from top to bottom. In my point it will effect America much more than china by blocking trade :)
Look at it from another point of view, this could‚Äôve stopped corporate taking over and being bigger than governments, have you looked at it from that angle, have you looked at the power that these people have got, have you looked at it from the angle that this isn‚Äôt cooperation between people to build the phone, this is what your political entities who control these industries to Veryfine family tree lines? Sorry to comment so often but there was a different angle to this I believe

Truth in marketing advertising in the auto market? Wow you are really Mary Poppins. I have had numerous cars in my lifetime. When I enter a showroom, the first thing I do is yell at the salesperson to stay the fuck away from me. I review the vehicle I am interested in and if I believe it to be right for me, I call the sales person, otherwise, as soon as these leeches approaches me, I just leave the place.

Prior to getting a huawei mate 20 x... Ive got my hands on the sleek p20 pro & one plus 5T... .. both feel huge in the hands.. and last dec. 22.. when i unbox my huawei mate 20 x...

The best way is to ban every brand that is not allowed to do business with huawei in China also in manufactories. It will damage everything and brings everything down from Apple to Qualcomm China should step up because after this it will be another brand that could threaten US brands.
Are you this fabled Mark-ass brownle, where Will Smith was rambling on about?
Omg, people these days want to be successful... What about happy ? Just because they are wealthy, smart, read '5 hours' every day doesn't necessarily mean they are happy ! I don't get why people put such a pressure on being successful. Steve Jobs was incredibly successful and what ? Read what he has written before death. All that success meant nothing cause he said he would have rather focused on other things in life if he had a chance !
Couldn't agree more with every single one of those items. I run an old 1999 Toyota Altezza (Lexus IS200) and love the fact that you have also figured out old Toyotas are the way to go. You didn't mention that all new cars have LED lights on the rear and now the front. single bulbs are blowing and the first generations vehicles. I can see a great future in having to replace single LEDs very soon as the whole unit will need to be replaced at the dealership. Keep up the good work Scotty, you talk a lot of sense.
StevensonCharles it allows you to have two separate SIM cards in the phone. Something the average doesn‚Äôt need from my experience

Slowly US will stop all trades relating to China products and US only have 2 phones to buy.. Samsung or Apple.. Trump will start WW3 (as some time traveller claims).. so let see how thing is.. but most likely trump will target other chinese phones as well...
I wouldn't call myself an enthusiast by any means, but I think the whole infotainment thing needs to die and be replaced with a clamp for your phone, which can already all the things the infotainment does, often better and there'd be no need to worry about updates.

This issue has a greater implication besides the commercial aspects which is the question of trust in business dealing with the Chinese. They respect, embrace and admire stronger competitor. But if trust is violated forcefully they will never forget and forgive. The game has just began and my money is definitely on the Chinese becos Huawei technology is too deeply embedded and it is just too expensive to totally replace them and it will be too time consuming. Plus the Chinese are natural fighter with deep pocket supported by their govt. God bless America.

I think you should separate mid range phones and high end phones so that it is gonna be fair for both mid range and high end phones. Also there will be more choice for different social classes. I will definitely watch the video if you make one! p.s. Your videos are great, keep up the good work!

All the trends you say, I agree aren't good. Worst being everything being an SUV, as if we're going off road all day long. The best worst car trends video on YouTube.v
Some great points Scotty that I fully agree with you on! These cars with the "huge gaping mouth" that if you get to close appear as though they'll "eat you and your children". Just ridiculous.
It's not low capacity, it's that it's loose so if it's applied to some force the battery will 'disconnect' from the phone

Bill y Ring times are completely pointless. You cant compare lap times when the cars are driven on different days in different weather conditions and most importantly by different drivers. Motor trend does it right testing the cars same day by the same person, limiting the amount of variables.

I have a S10+ and i dont at all regret buying it. S10+ is far above all . People only compare camera but they forget the excellent impressive video recording that samsung offers and also S10+ super slow video is far better than any other phone
Thank you for this video.... I realize I wasted my time to a mobile game.... But now my new goal is to reach the threshold to become a youtuber .. So that I never stop learning I watch more videos that help me to grow and to get new things to explore for a new content.... So I need your help guyssss.... If you want to explore my channel your free to check... I love you guys more power to us
but the US's #1 beef is that huawei was started by a miltary guy and more importantly, they make the networks - so it remains to be seen if the other companies will be affected...

My car is the best car. It dosent have any new tech, it has nothing fancy on the interior, no "infotainment", and only 130hp. But it also has an engine that dosent know how to quit. Around 400,000 miles and still going strong.
I don't see why some of those would not be street legal in the us and alot of them were more like they just never came to America
US Intelligence is pissed because they couldn't easily have Huawei to cooperate to allow backdoor for them without being known to the world. It is much easier for Western Intelligence to do their eavesdropping with Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, Ericsson....
What do you guys think of the artificially engineered 'pops-and-bangs' found in Jaguar F-Type, Focus RS, AMG CLA45 etc? I find that they are gimmicky and the novelty wears off fast

Thanks for your suggestion di but i also wanna share with you that what i sometimes feel is what i am doing is wrong and even my parents do not want me to choose sports as my career. Thus i get confused ki mujhe kya krna chahiye and i should think of it as soon as possible. What i need is just a confirmation or feel comfortable on my decision
The Chinese government had planted hacking chips on motherboards for hundreds of companies/products. I‚Äôm all in favor of NOT buying any Chinese products. Can‚Äôt trust them again with hardware.
The old school Mercedes pedal (also very common on American cars) is a great solution for saving space in the center console.
I think this is a good thing that this happened, we might have a good competitor to google. My opinion on this issue, is that trump is just a piece of shit that keeps doing these bans, because Huawei dominated the sales on 5g technology, why you might say? Because they are better, and cheaper than Cisco's crap.
Oh God, I got instant flashbacks to the star wars prequels flinches eye

Im a huawei phone user, love the hardware but bcoz of the situation, I am definitely not getting another huawei for my future device just bcoz of the fact that it will not be the same version of android. My mate 10 and mate 20 pro would most likely not get Android Q for that matter which sucks big time.
The message of this video is pretty inspirational and motivational, but I think the tense background music and the feeling that you're being shouted at sorta also demotivates you too.

I think the problem comes from the fact that you're adding FinalString after the new string from numbers. Try this: FinalString = FinalString + " " + numbers[int(number)] OR FinalString += " " + numbers[int(number)] Of course remove the reversed method

@Raudhah Abdul Hafiz if you need the pen and can't take the tablet with you everywhere, Note9.....
@Nate Eintracht That is absolutely not true. Where did you get the notion that they stated it was the most fun? Jason aside, who was madly in love with the car even before driving it, none of them were particularly enamored with it at all. The dog leg is cool, but the transmission doesn't feel well sorted and is difficult to shift. The engine makes a lot of power, but the car weighs so much it's not fast in a straight line. It doesn't have good handling dynamics on the limit and doesn't put power down well. At 7/10ths it might be a great drivers car, but not the best, and it certainly isn't at 10/10ths.

I hate all of it all the car features are bullshit, Every car I have had has been from 91 to 99 now grant it they're not as old school as I would prefer but there still a lot better then any 2018 every car I've had the seats you pull them back and forth you pull a lever to lean your seat back the radio has knobs and either you put a cassette tape in it or a CD you actually use a key to start it and both front doors have key slot on them and for the most part there's a decent amount of metal on them and the rims are have been Steel
Only once. Most sale prices depend on the area of sale. In Texas and California, they are still going for ~$5k over, but since they released, in the Mid-West they have been selling for ~$0-2k over from the beginning. It's all about supply and demand. Even with a $20k markup (which is the highest single markup recorded for the gt350, not the average) you could have 2 gt350s and an extra $35k for the price of that McLaren. I love both cars, but man is that Mustang a deal. Also, I'm a little bias, I've only ever owned Fords. Plus, I just bought a '16 Fiesta ST (which is freakin great btw). Food for thought :)

I agree with most of your list, but to a reasonable extent, I think a lot of us would agree that larger wheels, (17-18") look good on sports cars. It's not that big of a deal. If they come from the factory with larger wheels like that they are probably going to be engineered for those wheel sizes.

On the Android side I liked the clean design and approach to bezel removal of the Oppo Find X and also thought the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is very strong.

I love my 2001 Jeep Cherokee. No Abs, stability system...manual parking brake , 4 speed automatic that always is in the right gear and shifts instantly with no hesitation. Excellent outward visibility, rugged painfully simple drivetrain that is both easy and cheap to repair by any mechanic. The straight six with an iron block is from the ice age. Response is instant ...no turbo.... no stop start just instant torque. I do not like having my family in the Cherokee. Aside from being very solid it just is not a safe car. .......so........ in about 10 days I am buying the safest car money can buy. I am still keeping the Jeep. My new car will hit 60 in under 5 seconds. It has excellent handling and steering feel. It has room for four 6 foot + people. It also has the black piano trim, electric parking brake and a big screen in the center of the dash. A stability system that can‚Äôt be turned off. I drove it and I love it. Excellent vision all around ( save the rear view). In spite of being the safest car on the road. Instant torque like nothing else I have experienced with only a 1 speed transmission. Every thing that is wrong with most modern cars Tesla somehow got right. So like 108,000 people before me and over half a million people still waiting for a sedan .... not an Cuv. I am getting a Tesla 3. I won‚Äôt be saving the world quite yet ( I think the Cherokee and the 3 cancel each other out).

Just about every app on any phone that you use has access to your phone and data, who gives a fuck if its Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Samsung, Huawei they are all at it and if you are actually that bothered then you should just stay of the Internet, this is nothing but a vendetta against Huawei and I for one won't be put off buying their far superior devices.

You totally missed the point on 9 and 10 speed transmissions. On modern engines that hit the torque band at low rpms, the higher gears allow the vehicle to sit in the torque band for a larger amount of time. Also you missed the ball on keyless entry too. All vehicles with keyless entry have a physical key built in. Auto manufacturers aren't stupid. Of course you can get into you car with a dead battery. Also beside the shifter there is usually a plastic bit that can be popped off to shift the transmission into neutral to jump the car.
It doesnt matter if a smartphone camera has 2k megapixels on it if youre planning to take pictures for instagram youre always gonna get disappointed unless it's apple
I'm new to all this and you jumped to being in the pycharm. I couldn't find the console for python how you did. I ended up pressing "command e" and then I could see the python console. But you have two windows and I only have one. So it prints a line below in the same window. There is an event log window but nothing comes up in it when I am just typing in the python console.

after watch this video i lost 5 hours of my time thinking about myself, well done Bill Gates
Amen, I have been thinking about these things for a long time. I didn't buy a new car recently because the company refused to put in a damn volume control knob. Big physical buttons should be required for all the basic functions for stereo operation and climate control, it should NOT be buried in a touch screen that you have to stare at and mess with while taking your eyes off the road. I have seen some mfg's coming back to real buttons already. I mean seriously what's next, a touch screen to lower the windows, or open a door, no of course not, that's not what we want obviously, so why put climate controls in a damn touchscreen.
No, it comes to the fact that Instagram takes a lot of the quality when you upload the photos!
yes. you should learn the basics of python and program simple games like tic tac toe, asteroids, etc before you try to do something big. maybe spend a month or two learning the basics and then start looking towards more advanced projects.

Not that it deserves an award, but the Xr is the iPhone most people find to be the best value and size out of the Apple line-up. People are selling their Xs and Xs Max for the more reasonably priced Xr. Otherwise, great choices on the awards you presented. 6T deserved that award. The McLaren version certainly was an even better offering.

Hi, I personally agree with all of them but one, the Turbo engines. I understand your point, the turbo engines are much more complicated to operate because it implies a significant more number of mechanical pieces to move the car. In your video you pointed out the Turbo problem with Chevrolet Cruze. Please let me tell you that VolksWagen and its subsidiaries make excellent turbo engines, with very low maintenance costs and super efficient. Chevrolet once told VW that they will show how a 1.4 turbo engine will really work on a vehicle, but I think they failed with Cruze. Talk to people that have a Golf, a GTI, a SUV with this engine and I can assure you these people are very happy with their cars.

Who actually takes their daily driver to the track and uses their handbrake to drift around turns? Almost nobody. Unless you have a manual transmission, you almost never use an e-brake anyway.
@Apache-Yaqui Brown Helps quite a bit for the learning process at a minimum though.
No one is perfect in this world and people who have myopic vision always make fun of anyone and they try to find out shortcoming of next person so that they can pull him down. I know lots of American they say they feels good whenever they talk to a person from foreign country. Even one Native speaker told me that whenever he hears native speakers in any social gathering he doesn't have anything to look forward.
Did I just 97,000 deaths on the Tesla roadster that hasn‚Äôt come out yet.
@Yuzhou Qu If this is true then why is Samsung not attacked? Why aren't other people just getting wrecked to? Why isn't OnePlus and other chinise companies being attacked? Your argument makes no sense.
The winner for "The best small smartphone" should be a small smartphone in my opinion.
@R3D Apple in 2nd place in terms of what? Unit sales? 90% of all profits made from all smartphones goes to Apple, all other competition which makes up 80% of the marketshare, takes only 10% of of the pie when it comes to profit. Now, do you think Huawei entered the business for 2~5% margin, knowing that selling lemonade has far higher margin? Nope, they intend to eventually charge 37% margin like Apple does, which means, Apple is already at where Huawei wants to be ( the reason Huawei entered the market in the first place ), and Huawei is still far, far, far behind in being able to convince consumers to pay more than 5% margin for their hardware. Why do you suppose Huawei have unnecessary "Porsche Design" edition and team up with "Leica" to charge premium? Huawei is still stuck in Andriod's price war swamp and is trying to get out of it to start charging like Apple does. So, no, Huawei is still far far behind, let alone beating Apple.

None of you simple car drivers seems to be aware that this touch screen technology goes hand in hand with millions of deaths in the Congo over the last decade or so. You people are very irresponsible inhumane selfish egocentric short sighted braindead hairless monkeys. All you car owners have a lot of blood dripping from your shoulders. Add the wars in the Middle East over oil. Shame on all of you!!!
They were thinking "Wow, that Chrysler 300C looks cool". Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's where that stupid trend started.
I would like to work on the working out one. I've been doing it for a while now but it's not exactly there.. I miss weeks at a time sometimes and always tell myself I'll do it later. Sometimes I'll have a month that is just beastly and I won't miss a day, but then my friends come over for the night or something and my will power just goes down the drain. So I'll miss a week, and then go slowly back into it. I just want to make it a solid habit

Yes the on and off feature will make your cars engine wear so much quicker. Since town driving in general puts a lot of wear on the engine turning it on and off constantly will wear it out 3 times quicker
Millennials are driving the Vehicle Manufacturing as they are the ones that pay extra for garbage they don't need. But because they are permanently online and their lives, purchases are being shared so they need to show off their everything.

Ennis Spider-Man was my favorite. I kind of liked the first 2 seasons, but I'm having a hard time watching the 3rd. What I liked about the comic is that it would be really dark sometimes and then flip over to being really goofy. They proved they could get dark with what they did with Zoom, but they are afraid to get really goofy.
@Alan Harake Even crazy old Warren Buffett is worried about self driving cars. Its the future! I would honestly consider buying stock on it now before its too late.
Also the "safety" features make people become lazy, distracted, and bad drivers. Namely, lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, auto-braking, self-parking, and purported Autopilot. If you unable to maintain your vehicle within a travel lane and keep safe driving distance with the cars in front of you, then you shouldn't be driving. Blind-spot monitoring might have some benefits, but I've seen people solely rely on that when switching lanes without turning their heads. Don't you still need to know how to parallel park to pass road test? Or has that changed? Autopilot? Let's just say that is more than a marketing gimmick than a feature. Take a Uber next time if you are too lazy to drive.
The word you were looking for was Propaganda Lew üòÇ There are options to root devices and side load apps (depending on how far this will go). But what bothers me the most is that we tend to overlook how restrictive China is in allowing American companies to sell their goods to the people of China. Software companies like FB and Twitter, Google (YouTube etc) and all of the rest aren't even allowed to be used on their devices. But that doesn't even account for the stolen (or I guess the PC version would be "copied" versions) they use instead. Hardware and other products are just as bad (now it might have become less restricted recently and I am a bit off here but you get my meaning). This is a horrible thing to do, and I hope it is resolved. But saying it's an attack on their People is a bit much. Especially when you compare it to what their government allows them to do with IP and what it when does to them. It's really an attack on the company's dealings outside of China.

hey i am somewhat confused so it be really nice if someone could clear this for me. You mentioned what an IDE and later on you suggested Pycharm's Community edition to follow the series but later on in the video you said you will use Jupyter Notebook as a IDE. Are the same thing? and why did you suggest Pycharm and later on said that you will use Jupyter notebook? Is it simply because it's easier or is it more effect? what will change for me if i choose Pycharm?
Nice Realmi 3pro I am very Interest this üì± and very nice video
What bothers me most about new cars is the sudden urge to do something 'new and exciting' with the gear selector. Whether it's a knob on the dash, a joystick on the dash, a knob on the center console or some other thing. What was wrong with the regular shifter on the steering column or the center?
For that price, the Nokia phones are the better phones in this price range.

@GTA V Gameplay & More Programming is made up from a few abilities being : 1. The ability to except input, 2. To provide output 3. The ability to perform a task multiple times 4. The ability to perform tasks depending upon a condition 5. Creating and calling for pre-created code to execute (functions) 6. Some languages allow you to simulate the creation of real world objects in code (Object Oriented Programming) Tell me if you have questions. I'm here to help :)

Nice telling mute to shut up on this genius guy and thinks tesla is safest f*cking roblox lover.
I prefer dashboards that put visuals (information screens and readouts) in a position that requires the least amount of eye movement from that information to the road. I owned a second gen Prius and an 06 Civic and both made it so easy to monitor, check, and take-in (necessary) information with virtually no distraction from the road. Yes, I too thought those screens sticking out of the top of the dash were idiotic and stupid, but after having a Jetta with the screen BELOW the freaking air vents for two years, I'm targeting cars like the AudiA3 or 4 with that screen closer to eye level in a safer position. What do you think about the "heads-up" displays Mazda uses? P.S. Tesla's design doesn't work. Talk about a distraction. What do you do every time you want to find something or need information? Pull over?
MKBHD, just became aware of ur channel when I was searching for Samsung Galaxy 9 reviews. I just ordered mine.

@Klasse Act; No problem and yeah, like Nickolai said above, the new stang 5.0 engine has both direct and port. It makes things more complex under the hood, but I think the mfgs. are seeing how direct is going to be a problem child down the road. I think we'll see more and more dual setups. And yeah, it's interesting that the Germans don't follow suit, they will I'm sure.
Chinese will put extra effort $$$ on helping a democratic candidate get elected on next election lol.
Completely disagree with this list. You have all the time to figure your car out and figure out the interface. The stuck on screens are stylish in the German cars. The retracting handles look awesome, and yes ppl care about appearance. Most of your footage is of Fiat Chrysler vehicles which I think have some of the best interiors and infotainment setup.

I know cost "isn't a factor", but the fact that you can afford a GT350R and you can't afford a 570s says something about the real winner - it's 3x the price tag! I'm very partial to the viper b/c I just always have loved that car, but that aside if I had to pick one of the others, I think I'd pick that GT350R w/o much of a second thought.

Began self-learning python 4 weeks ago and was able to follow along for the most part although there were a few methods and libraries I've never encountered in this video. As for how much time I spent in those 4 weeks, I would say around 10-15 hours a week. I also use Pycharms which is a super easy IDE to use and followed the materials in a textbook titled, 'Explorations in Computing: An Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming' by John S. Conery. Currently on chapter 8 and hopefully I will get through 9 and 10 this coming week.

crazy expensive warranties that are in the manufacturers favor. Maintenance intensive cars were key parts are impossible to find. Heavily exaggerated lap times and 0-60 speeds. And Finally the general direction that Tesla will push cars into. .
@MFaust32096 . I don't know where the Communist Party will push China in the future. But I also hope that they can strike a balance between freedom and democracy and communism. And now China, I think we are not communist now. Doctrine. I think it would be too exaggerating if it was developed into American freedom. If I choose a direction or a Nordic system, I am yearning for it.(I didn‚Äôt know you were discussing politics before)

I did enjoy the video, of mostly on target. But while I don't own the phone because I have an s10+, I think you missed the mark the LG G8 ThinQ, OK it has that gimmick with the hand scanner, but otherwise it's right up there, and already discounted to $700.00 unlocked from a reputable dealer, or less on some carriers who are giving $200 Visa cards which could bring it down to $620.00. At about $300 less. I would have bought this instead. It's cameras are great. While no on screen fingerprint scanner, the rear scanner is fast, it's face unlock is more secure. The screen while not as good as Samsung is still pretty damned good and QHD. I just don't think it gets the respect. But is starting to sell stateside. While I wouldn't but it in the top 5, I would in the top 15. I also understand this is more a global audience and price differences may vary do to regions. The G8 also isn't one hottest in design but more function over looks. Every company has it's gimmicks, not only LG.
Well sometimes its usefull, I used to forgot to turn off my lights so it was pretty useful at the time, now its just anoying

I read about cold showers and tried it myself. It worked when I did it. For some reason it does energize you for the day, don't know why.
If you don't use these things - they are senseless to you. But for those who actually use them - it's like a goldmine. And about the idea of using a screen instead of a windshield: it is great for a night drive because you can trace the info about speed or anything else on the screen and don't look down on a speedometer. Also, you can install night vision cameras and see the road a way better than just with your naked eyes. I proud that there are the manufacturers that still makes something new. Look at the smartphones today: they are so similar to each other in design and overall look. Standardization is not always good. SFMBE.

Was about to upgrade from a p10 to the p30 literally this weekend due to the amazing camera performance (also one of the best smartphones without a curved display - I'm personally against curved screens but I understand the design appeal) but obviously having to rethink after this bombshell. Anyone got any recommendations of other phones with good cameras around this price point?
Lol yes, yes, let the ignorance and the fact that you didn't actually listen to Lew consume you!
I guess that's what happens when you let a woman design a car. Lol. J/k!!!
That Tesla Autopilot crash was the drivers fault. You are supposed to keep your hands on the wheel and stay alert. Tesla is by far one of the safest car brands there is. Also, it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to blame car manufacturers safety features when it‚Äôs the drivers fault, you‚Äôre not supposed to rely on them and drive unaware
Improvement Pill I read, meditate and play soccer.. And yet I'm unable to quit smoking.. What am I doing wrong ?? To be honest, I study texts and materials related to my field of expertise, and read other books when I have the time. I play football every Sunday.

Why bash the Note 9 ? Just cause you don't like it ? I got the Note 9 ( and a Mate 20 Pro ) and the Note is still a beast. With a good sense of taking care of it and a normal usage .. it still gets me 6 hours and half of SOT in a heavy day and 8 hours in a chill day. My maximum was 10 hours and half of SOT. Weaker battery life my ass. And what ... S10+ opens an app 1 second faster and that is WoWoW ? Yeah tell the Average Joe that ... he might be veeery amazed ...... not. The camera system is good for its age. Yeah you don't have a ultra wide ... so what ? The front facing camera is not WOW material on the S10+ either. You gonna get the hearts and likes anyhow on social media ... so ... ? Speaking of bezels ... at least the bezels are symmetrical unlike the hole punch. The fingerprint scanner never ever failed me while the ultrasonic one is still hit and miss even after updates. I understand the marketing gimmick here ... promoting the S10 ... but come on ... Note 9 is aging very well and people should consider it too. For the price of the Note 9 right now ... it offers one of best packages. A solid phone for at least 2 more years. Your channel is watched by normal people too, you know ? Not only by tech-ies, phone collectors or rich people that can afford to change their phones at 6 months or yearly etc. So speak right my man.

I'd suggest you watch this tutorial to the end and complete all the exercises. I've carefully designed these exercises to help you train your programming brain. Once you learn to code, you're halfway there. For data analysis, you also need some math background. There are plenty of resources out there, so don't worry if you don't have a math background.
Hooray for you! I think the Lexus's with the "cowcatcher" grill is the worst design since the Pontiac Aztek. Also hate the fake vents and scoops needed to make a poor design better.
@Èôà‰øäËàü still you will need developers to have a successful OS and i doubt they would work with Huawei
There's an app to crank your car if you have a flat battery and also a welder app.
I hope Samsung will make some significant improvements on the Note 10 in comparison to the S10, otherwise I'll go with the S10 5G.

How did you learn Python and all of your languages? and if you read books which books?

I have my OnePlus 3T, great device, bough for around $380(128GB version) and I have it like over 2 years, let's assume I'll use it for 3 years, that's $10 per month! This garbage breaks down after one month, it's 7 times more expensive! ...
can you also add data-structures and algorithm videos with interview question in python
@Lew @Willy-Do-Who-Knew ........

How do I get pixel 3 camera software on my one plus 6t and is it better
@1000 subscribers with a dead channel challenge I don't see why you like keyless so much, yh it may save time... that I agree with, however it can also come a great risk to getting your car jacked... The RF Signature on it can be cloned, if you leave your key's in you window that is close to you car, it won't be locked etc... Is the 2min of hassle rly worth the risk of you loosing your car ?? I'm just saying lol, cool feature, but does have strong risk's when it comes to security!
what if you put a doc tape on the battery and make sure it stays attached to the phone?
I found so many people here who aren't so fluent in English :D

Hy Scotty, Happy New Year ! You are absolutly right , 10 out of 10 Points. It seems they build Cars not for Costumers only for Photographs.
I seriously doubt Chevy and GMC ever beat them in total sales any time recently.

@pochoun33137 Yep. Saab looked at some complicated system that moved the crankshaft up and down in the block way back when.
Thanks guys - very much enjoyed the show (and your channel). I get it with the Maclaren but its probably the most expensive car there and therefore wasn't really tested against its peer group. Could be a bit anodyne in other company. Think the porker was probably the winner if you factor in value.. and more poignantly performance given the raw numbers but I don't them to win every test so fair play !
Just like America changed from big v8 cars, to small 4 cylinder sedans, it's time to change to 4 cylinder SUVs which I wouldn't mind if there was a 8 cylinder in some of these SUVs
@Robert Hardy Go talk to United Nations buddy! Taiwan is not recognized! Wake up! And in fact Taiwan government is illegal, they exist only because PRC government choose to leave them alone. Get some education in the university, really.
I am big fan for real me I am wait for realme 3 Pro
So what have we learned? I now know to buy a 1930's car, No seat belts or Tech because clearly those two things kill people lol
@Cathy Yu yes but my point was : just because a country doesn't invade another , it does not mean that they can be trusted
Truc Nguyen well we can practice via skype , Facebook messenger, WhatsApp , Telegram and so on . My email is : erfan110mahdavirad@gmail.com Or I guess you can add on skype with my skype name : erfan.rad4 .
@savagegeese I got a good one that they need to really stop doing. I see a few cars now that when the driver exits and locks the vehicle it turns the reverse lights on so you can see around the vehicle. These lights stay on for an extended period long after the driver has left. Confuses other drivers making them wait and think that someone is in the vehicle trying to reverse and if that vehicle is parked on a street of in a driveway backing onto a busy road then it creates a distraction hazzard for other drivers and can lead to missing a real hazzard that should be avoided. Don't know who green lit that idea but I'm pretty sure that should be banned. Have seen it on a few Chevy trucks.. not sure able it other vehicles...

What an oustanding job! You guys knocked it out of the park again. You guys are head and shoulders above any other auto enthusiast show on TV/online!
He said car salesmen have car leases, which is usually because they get big discounts from their dealerships and can write it off as a work expense as well. People who AREN'T car salesmen or that aren't getting a lease specifically for work so it can be written off on taxes, it's a TERRIBLE rip off. You're better off saving up to spend cash on a car you can afford.
I dont agree start stop button is anoyying is rlly gud
I think a lot of modern cars, are taking away the learn how to drive factor. I understand stability programmes and abs but, this takes over from you. I learnt how to drive in a car with none of this.
great, now i can remove detention from my name and add it to a bunch of assholes in my school
@nidal sarieddine Thank you :) I'll see what I can do
i think with this video i am surely going to learn how to program with python
Hi, may I ask what kind of screen recording are you using? Thanks!
you can dislike whatever you want, that doesnt change the fact that people want a nice, fancy car, so these trends are appropriate to the current market, they might not be appropriate for people like this. At the end of the day people want as many features for as little money as possible, so the actual smart people here are the ones who decide to put these "bad" trends on cars because they're the ones moving the industry forward and making millions doing it.
it depense okay if you learn something new such as coding or writing e-book or etc these are really useful and i don't consider it to be wasteful enough .Just like the knive,it depense on how you use it ,if you use it to cut meats and vegetables itis very wise but if ypu use the knive to stab a person then it becomes dangerous
Aleph Null my local ford dealership has an gt50r. It has a 50k $ markup.
I have to disagree with the 19" wheel point, but I'm pretty sure my VW Golf TDI was designed and built around the idea of supporting 19" wheels along with the turbo. It's no Crown Vic, but a really smooth ride nonetheless. I'm gonna miss it when I sell it back to VW, but I'm hoping they will work with me and give a good deal on a GTI. Not really sure if I want to stick with VW though.
You're helping me with these tutorial, I'm glad that there is a person who are willing to help without payment required.
I'll stick to the fitness/diet habit for the next 30 days!
Well funny you mention it. This would actually suit my next trip via motorcycle across China,Russia and Europe abeit with a very slow Honda Grom
i really really wanna chase mi dream and work for it bit somethings holding me back i have no idea what thai bullshit is :(
MECHANIC SPOILERS. They do nothing because they are too small. Only there for looks.
LED bulbs of any type are unlikely to fail and need replacement for as long as you own our car. Here is a table I found of expected service life for different bulb types: Incandescent = 750 to 1,000 hours Halogen = 2,000 to 3,000 hours Metal Halide = 7,500 to 10,000 hours Fluorescent = 15, 000 to 20,000 hours Mercury Vapor = 16,000 to 24,000 hours High Pressure Sodium = 15,000 to 25,000 hours High Power LEDs =35,000 to 100,000 hours

I got a question at 4:06:04 or in the minute following that, how can the computer tell if the index numbers (0,1,2 etc.) are going to starting at 1,2,3. I am talking about these numbers when it is showing how many the user got correct. Is it trying to make it in a way that the user can interpret or something else? If anyone can answer this question please reply.
What's worse is when you've abandoned everyone and then something makes you regress back to what everyone else used to see you as and now you're here, leaving everyone with the side of you that you know is not you. It does take it toll hehe

my drift truck has the foot pedal e-brake. it's a lot easier than the handbrake and its definitely better than those electronic e-brake. I do power slides in a 1/2 ton. really fun (in a field and with a firm grip on the steering wheel, safety first) the truck is a 2007 ford ranger 4 litre v6 at 207 hp and 239 lb-ft of torque

Can you please make a video of your entire coding journey in details step by step and also time frame how long i took to become expert ( I mean a detailed journey, which part from where you learnt, how much time it took you progressed step by step, all in detail) I am starting my journey with python.

fake video none of its real people will be people keep doing customs to their car it Will never stop no matter how stupid we think it is buy your car your going to customize it it's called LOVE
Can you please recommend a decent laptop for programming? One I am looking at is Microsoft Surface Pro 6 or the MacBook Pro 13inch. What laptop's do you recommend / prefer ?
IMO, the "space saving" spare tire is the most retarded thing. My civic has one, but the hole in the trunk still has to be big enough for the regular full size tire. It doesn't save space, it saves money for the manufacturer.
I like the video but why dies this Anaconda fail to install properly on any of my three windows 10 systems? the help section is for windows 7 i have made 8 attempts with the same result each time. Pitty I was looking forwar to following your tutorial.
@Chad Cooper You are correct. I have very little knowledge of vehicle history and while that may be the case, I still believe that it looks like crap on any new car, ESPECIALLY if it serves no purpose but aesthetically. Same with racing stripes and chrome. People need to focus more on getting a car mechanically sound before they drop thousands of dollars on expensive rims and plastic non-work ventiports. Catch my drift, Chad. :)
I fucking love the BMW warnings especially the start up noises. Makes you remember, your better then others :)
Thanks you have explained in such a easy way ! Thanks a lot and we are waiting for other videos
I think European factories are guilty of starting most of those trends.

Nightvision? Spoken like a desk jockey who doesn't own a car with it. I love it so much, I added it to my E46 M3, first in the world actually. Not only has it saved me from countless deer (and tickets) it does make a great conversation piece. Living in a college town, it also allows me not to accidentally (or purposefully) run over the next journalism student looking to make videos he apparently knows nothing about.
Love your vids, YK! can you tell me what kind of pc specs that I need to learn programming? Thanks!
I feel like I'm watching a father teaching his children how to bully his enemy's child who have nothing to do with the dispute. You know what I mean?
Floating screen are good it helps when you want to are driving and want to use your screen its less distracting
i fail to setup the pycharm the way it appears in the video i don't know what is the problem
name = input('What is your name? ') color = input('What is your Favorite color? ') birth_year = input('Birth year: ') age = 2019 - int(birth_year) age = str(age) weight_lbs = input('Weight (lbs): ') weight_kg = int(weight_lbs) * 0.45 print("Hi " + name + ' Your favorite color is ' + color + ' You are ' + age + ' years of age.') print('your weight in kg is: ' + str(weight_kg) + 'kg') I was getting an error because I was trying to print age in the sentence and it would not concatenate a number with a string. I figured it out though I wrapped aged around str() I just wanted to share info for newbies.

1. Fitness is easy for me. 2.meditation need to do more. 3.reading need to do more.
The biggest problem is that a lot of modern cars try all of these on the same model and the result is an ugly mess. You use chrome OR unpainted trim OR fake exhausts OR a huge grill OR ... It becomes a mess if you put all of it on the same car. I consider the Chevy Bolt and the BMW i3 some of the worst looking cars, especially compared to the Tesla M3.

I was just wondering for a while now what about video games ? Should we consider it as a bad habit because it's a huge time waster and it doesn't bring anything after doing it (maybe at the beginning there's some things you learn but most of it is not useful in real life) But i also feel like it's a lot of fun and it doesn't provoke cancer or any dangerous stuff so it's not that bad for yourself... Feel free to tell me what you think about it
With the first device, repeatedly touching/swiping/stroking your skin will in time lead to skin complaints/rashes for some people... & yes the mind does boggle to where some people will attatch this thing, (& believe me there are a few people who have considered the possibilities). I wonder if there will be a disclaimer attached to this device.
