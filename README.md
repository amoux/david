# david - Vuepoint Analytics

* David is an NLP toolkit implemented with Gensim, Tensorflow, PyTorch, NLTK, and spaCy among other open-source libraries. At Vuepoint, we are applying models built on these libraries for text-classification, intent-detection, topic-modeling to improve youtube content creators view of their audience to produce more suitable content.

*The goal for David is to assist content creators to increase the exposure on YouTube and their videos in the presence of more viewers. From live/historical textual information.*

> Currently the project is still in beta stages. Once the library is stable enough, an enhanced realease will be available for the public to use.
