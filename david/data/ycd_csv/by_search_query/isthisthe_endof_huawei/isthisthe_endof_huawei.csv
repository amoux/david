I don't know about Huawei but I can tell you Lenovo add Keylogger chips to all their computers sold to Colleges and US Gov't agencies (Via under former name IBM PC). They use spyware for consumers. Now Oneplus can sell their phones in US because they have been vetted to not be own by PLA (Too smaller of a company). One thing all Chinese companies have to abide by is their Chinese National Intelligence Law Article 7, which states ‚Äúobligation of Chinese citizens to support national intelligence work.‚Äù However, ‚Äúit does not authorize pre-emptive spying; national intelligence work must be defensive in nature.‚Äù Example, PLA can order Oneplus to provide all data relevant to any US citizen and the Chinese Gov't will get it because Oneplus is a Chinese company. As for proof you'll never see proof from US Gov't which will expose method of detection and or source which can harm US methodology if discovered. Huawei will have no problem surviving despite what people think. OS is not that hard to create. They can get a free version of Android and integrated with their EMUI and provide their own updates or they can do what Apple has done and use Linux base OS and create their own.

China depends on the US to feed their people. The farmers in the US realise the tariff 'war' will short term have a negative influence to them.

The first thing i see is that people see the device and dont even know how it was made. Who made the microchips. Who powers the system. Who owns all the components before they sell them to you. Who mines for this material. Your phone has some form of iligitimat activity going on wether you know it or not. Its creative destruction. And governmental deconstruction. Thease companys that are doing great eventually get shut down for the sake of now haveing to worry about them afterwards. Wether they are doing good or bad for the people. Your phone is invovled your cloths your hat anything you buy has been through the doors of a company that is either governmentally controlled with laws or illigitimatly controlled by a rouge group who wants to do good but is painted red to seem bad. 5g is not good. Its fast. But is it safe. And after a couple more generations how will it stay safe. Your phone gives off more radiation then a 5g tower. Yet you hold it in your hands and in your pocket your bathed in it. Some are imune to this frequincy bandwidth others arent imune. In all honesty its only right that everyone suffers because we are the invisible hand in the market. In some way the masses of people have caused this to happen.,1 day ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,236,1288,4.461864407,0,0,,,,,0.1565079365,0.5220634921,positive

The money in R&D would be better spent for the time being focusing on staying alive as a company. They still have markets outside of the US and being 100% self reliant would take years and in the tech market in the US it is very unlikely they could recover from that. As far as just throwing together an operating system quickly to save face I doubt that would fair well, look at how windows phones went. That was a very established trusted brand but it was a new concept. I don't foresee windows phones making a comeback anytime soon. With this pretty much tarnishing they're name I don't see any new development happening in the US market right now unless this all goes away really quickly and people are able to forget. Right now I'd imagine they are focussed on damage control and support for their current customers if they are going to keep any shred of their name in tact and maybe trying to move the remainder of the current line of phones not affected in stock. Either way its bad news all around as it cuts completion which lessens incentives and it would be damaging to the progress of the mid tier market that its crucial to getting any kind of decent affordable product with advancement in ingenuity and new features slowing and prices either holding or in some cases still rising in the more established brands.

It'll take them a while to come up with a decent OS and if they follow what Samsung did with their Tizen, I don't think they'll have any problems. Samsung sells Z series Smartphones with Tizen with no Android OS attached to it to a smaller market and won't have any problems transitioning over to their flagship if need be. Don't sell Huawei short when it comes to hardware. They have very minimal time to copy any hardware. They're still selling counterfeit Cisco Systems, Ericsson, NEC, Juniper Networks, Oracle and so forth to worldwide customers. I think out of all of them they tailor to their design, the Cisco Systems' network equipment they copied to include flawed OS didn't change much and Cisco corrected the OS on the later models that Huawei don't have. They're Hq in Shenzen the electronics innovation and hardware counterfeit Capital in the world. If you never been there you'll never know how good they're really are at electronics counterfeit. (Go through YouTubes to see what I mean) They have huge contracts in Afghanistan and Africa to establish network infrastructure and their not going to lose any cash flow anytime soon. Anyhow unlike the US Gov't, Chinese Gov't always subsidize their companies hence why their electronics are cheap and the company will never go out of business. I know from the outside the company seems to be in trouble but they're not. A little setback? Sure not enough to lose a huge market share. Your point is valid if it was a Non-Chinese company like Apple. Apple would go out of business without a bailout from the US Gov't.

Its just that we are finally seeing some positive trends with mid tier phones being able to match some features of the flagship devices at an affordable price and to have a setback to that change would overall hurt the consumer's choices when it comes down to price over function. Not saying there is one in phone manufacturers but a monopoly only benefits itself. I know we have more than a few choices right now but the main ones are set the market trends. Its how we got the screen ratio wars which led to various setbacks in my opinion. I personally don't use the headphone jack but it upset a lot of people who use it regularly when it went. Phones are now made thinner less robust more susceptible to breaking in order to fit a trend. Its because of a lack of new ideas that we have these trends that are marketed as what we should buy. We could be further along with battery life than we are if trends weren't the focus. Its down to the major companies being forced to come up with useful concepts rather than just trying to make minor changes seem bigger. We need new ideas. Samsung was on the right track although I don't think folding phones are the future, they still took a risk with the idea. Without competition the big companies will never have a reason to take risks and we'll pretty much stall out. Apple is already showing some signs of this with their overall sales not matching previous years. Its inevitable that if there's no push to innovate the rest will follow suit. I'm OK with the phone I currently have now, no complaints but I'm not sure where things will be when it comes time to upgrade again. I didn't think Huawei would go out of business but I do think the setback with the American market for now at least and this whole subject is going to see some changes in how things work going forward. Huawei is just an example of what could happen to other companies that may not be as fortunate.

The technology to do a drastic improvement isn't here yet. At some point we'll reach out zenith in technology and stagnate for a few years until break through comes thru. Huwawei will be an example of companies they'll go after. US Gov't doesn't go after companies just because. They go after a particular company such as Huawei or ZTC because they have PLA backing, got caught performing intelligence gathering or violated sanctions and of course they're trying to access our network infrastructure. Like all major powers, our network carrier are the backup for our military communications. If US ever go to war and lose all their comms from EMP or other method of destruction the carrier comms will belong to the military for use. No more civilian use except for maybe ham radio or certain area that the military isn't located. You mentioned OnePlus. OnePlus is one of those companies US Gov't may not go after because they sell phones only and nothing else. So the chance that PLA will do anything with OnePlus are slim. Remember, OnePlus is a Chinese company and they have to follow the Chinese National Intelligence Law - Article 7. If the Chinese Gov't ask for data of you from OnePlus, OnePlus will provide all data of you to them. Something to think about. As China get hammered with sanction over and over they are slowly becoming self reliant. Hence, why they took the Spratly Islands for the large gas and oil deposit. China knows they have no claim to the islands but they also know no one will challenge them militarily so they'll take it for themselves.

Europe wants to maintain a balance with China, the United States and Russia. Simply put, Europe wants a multi-polar world. China is a multi-polar world. It has common interests with Europe. The Boeing airplane accident of a while ago caused China to cancel the US aircraft orders. Instead, China ordered more than 300 Airbus aircraft from Europe. Look at the history of France helping the United States defeat the United Kingdom, but the United States has ruined Alstom. Why is the relationship between Europe and China now approaching, and the United States should reflect on its own policies. I think that Mark Long is a good president. He is very open-minded and has his own vision. I think that it is good for Mark Long to make the French people more diligent, because China is a diligent rise. Any hardworking nation is very powerful. The same is true of Japan.",7 hours ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,260,1509,4.807692308,1,5,,,,,0.19,0.4538392857,positive

Huawei can design processors entirely on its own, free from external constraints. Even if Huawei no longer authorizes a new version of Huawei, it can continue to develop on its own on the basis of previous versions. Other EDA chip design tools are the same. Huawei can continue to use them even if it can't continue to get new versions. This leaves time for Huawei. In fact, Huawei has other ways to avoid it, such as outsourcing. Just like you buy a car and you can rebuild the system by yourself, but after-sales is not the follow-up guarantee. This is also the time and space for Huawei to develop itself after the sale. As for Huawei system, even if Huawei does not make its own system, Google will launch Fuchsia OS. Even Samsung actually prepared its own system many years ago, but it was suspended after Google warned. You can see that Samsung's watch is using its own system, so you can see that as factories are expanding their ecosystem {car, mobile phone, computer, etc.). I'm all preparing my backup plan and I don't want to be controlled by Google all the time. I'm glad to see the birth of the ecosystem outside of iOS and Google. Huawei should be as ready as Apple to open its own developer conference. This autumn's conference is the highlight. At the same time, software and architecture authorization belong to service-oriented products. One is that there is no problem of large-scale supply, and I can continue to use them without continuing to supply them, and I have time to continue to improve them. The other is that there is no legal problem, which is also crucial. This means that Huawei's mobile phones and other products can continue to be sold smoothly in all countries of the world without being prohibited by local laws.

And I felt different since I move out of China, I cant deny we chinese took some shortcut or advantage by blocking some of those western media that group our own stuff like BAT(baidu,alibaba and tecent). But I began to believe that CPP has another worry about it, about the politic influence though those so called ""free web"", US goverment can easily over thrones other country's goverment, like what happen to the spring of arabs, and things happen in HK and Taiwan and so on, all those wars you western world force to other countries just shocked me, and just make me wondering that CPP mgith did the right thing, we chinese just got enough from wars over 200 years, we just want to be safe and maybe oneday we can tribute like what ""old western world ""did to the world, okie mostly your world. the truth is you didnt help or didnt want to help all those countries you dislike. Lew said CPP try to broadcast some sort of national pride style to the people, yes thats right,but before this month CPP was trying to hide it to the people, they just doesnt want start a trade war with US, yep, some people always find a better explenation of it ,like hiding it is because of worry about money go out of china, then why not keep doing it ,you know they are capable to do it. Yes its getting more dangerous , and yes its 100% not about trade anymore, my point is china's system might not be perfect ,which goverment leading everything right now . but think about western system you called ""democracy‚Äú , the original idea was good just like ours. but nowadays its just getting more and more crazy which big company lead it , they will make it happen in which way they want ,is it more terrify ? there is no one speaking for the people anymore,they just make you believe that they really doing shit for you. in the end who actully benefit from this so call trade war? US goverment and trump , people will pay the tax ,chinese wont pay ,yes you hurt chinese market, all the factory move out ,and then ?are they going to move back to the state? no ! cause you still believe its not your proplem , your emploee are just cost too much, so all the factory will move out from china to where ? india ,east asian and even africa , but trust me on this ,they will not move back to the state.so what then ? you will start a war with all other country like this again ? think though your brain people ,trump snap the finger , millions of dollars vanished by sending a fucking twitter that not even discussed with his own fucking white house stuff, this is madness. But he can easily make tons of money for some fucking big company through this move ,he is not helping anything in US, and most dangerous part is most of people believed that china is every problem begin ! china saved your ass when 2008 finace crushed, if your goverment not putting your people and your tax money to all those fucking wars, stop put all those moeny spying on everyone in the earth ,and spend some fucking time with your own problems ,they might had fix it already ! ""mecican will pay for this wall!"" ""USA USA USA"" China is not Japan and will learn from history Chinese are not the same chinese 200 years ago we might not 100% civilized like what you said But I am 100% sure we wont sign any thing with a fucking ""bankrupt loser"" called himself start from nothing ...a business loser trying tell people he is with them ...

Maybe it will be suffering in next 10 years, but when the world‚Äôs second largest economy is fully committed to technological self-reliance, it will hurt US company much more than the damage what Chinese companies now receive. I really love US tech companies such as Google Microsoft AMD and so on. As a tech fan, I really respect the great contributions of these American technology companies to human development. But when Huawei made a very advanced 5G chip, this is also the contribution of Chinese companies to scientific and technological progress. Balong 5000 is no doubt stronger than x50. Qualcomm wants to use the X55 chip to compete with it but still in the lab. Theoretical data is close but still below balong 5000. Don't you think about why Huawei can do this? The United States completely blocks its exports to China in the military field, finally China began to build its own fighter aircraft. The United States does not allow Chinese astronauts to enter the International Space Station, so they built their own space station. It is because the United States does not allow China to import these things, and China has made these things by itself. For this technology war, China is suffering in short time.

HUAWEI and other Chinese companies may really did a decent job in the Western world, CURRENTLY, however, they did really dirty things in China. They treat their employees bad, steal private info from customers, and help the government or themselves to censor the content online, banning customers to see the negative facts. Huawei and lots of other Chinese companies forces its employees to work 10-14 hours per day, 6 days per week, and when someone posts this fact online, these companies ban it. These Chinese companies do no evil in the Western world only because they aren't currently own the whole market, and China is not as powerful as America. I almost 100% believe they will do MUCH MORE EVIL than current American companies if they finally beat the US companies and become monopolies like current American companies. Don't believe? Want to see what they look like after owning the market? Welcome to China, here is the proof. Extreme censorship, No employee rights, No customer privacy, Censoring even more than the law requires for the gov while doesn't even follow the law when comes to employee and customer rights. You can have this video on Youtube, an American website, saying the US devices have backdoors, as well as all these pro-Huawei and anti-Trump comments here, not being removed, because you are using the American (or other western) services and American companies and gov have at least a bottom line when doing evil. If I post this comment on a Chinese website in Chinese, it will highly possible be removed. They do a lot of evil, much worse than those 'US backdoors', here in China, because they own the market here.

745,wsl 0216,Ugy50RQGazbCSMaUVCB4AaABAg,"Overseas media comments: cracking down on Huawei to tear off the US ""Enterprise Freedom"" fig leaf 2019 / 05 / 22 the overseas media reported on May 22 that on the 20th, Internet giant Google has shown the extent to which American companies are obedient to White House political opinions. The Commerce Department's decision to put Huawei and its 68 affiliates on the so-called blacklist has wiped out the corporate freedom that the United States is proud of in practice. According to the Russian newspaper's website on May 21, Trump declared a state of emergency on the grounds that his information and communication system was suspected to be threatened, and his order was not yet dry, and US companies doing business with China responded hastily. Google announced that it will no longer provide some services to Huawei, which will not be able to get Android updates. It is a self-evident question of why IT, which at least ostensibly has nothing to do with the country, has suspended its long-term obligations to Huawei in order to comply with Washington's political orders. It is reported that several other US companies have followed Google's lead. Trump declared a state of emergency in the United States, allowing the government to ban domestic communications companies from buying products from foreign companies that ""threaten national security,"" the report said. The move, first aimed at Huawei, shows once again what the White House intends to do to make the United States strong again. Mr Trump said ""special threats to US national security, diplomacy and the economy"" had emerged, an interpretation designed to prove the need for a state of emergency had nothing to do with reality. The typical discrimination against Huawei shows once again that the US government is doing everything it can around the world to prevent its own companies from facing competition. Russia has been treated similarly in Europe. To sell liquefied natural gas, Americans used the second line of the north stream gas pipeline to scare the old world. Washington is also asking the European Union to give up its own production of weapons for the sake of American manufacturers. According to the report, the willingness of US companies to implement White House political orders makes the agreements they have signed have no legal significance. For the White House, if the United States cannot win, there will be no ""fair competition."" According to an article published on the website of Hong Kong's Toutiao Daily on May 21, people used to think it was open, but it was not true. Without emergency, US President Trump signed an executive order on 15 May alleging that foreign ""hostile forces"" pose a national security threat to the communications system of the United States on the grounds that ""the country is in a state of emergency."" In fact, American companies are prohibited from doing business with Huawei in China, and they are not allowed to buy Huawei's products or sell goods or services to Huawei. Google immediately announced that it would stop some of its business with Huawei phones, the article said. When smartphones started in 2007, Apple developed its own mobile operating system, while Google developed Android, but because Google was unsuccessful in making its own phones, it opened Android to other smartphone makers. To compete with Apple's system. Google has made money from its Android app store and has developed a lucrative business. The article said that when everyone believed that Android was an open system, suddenly in a false state of emergency declared by the President of the United States, the United States could instruct Google to exclude a handset maker from Android. The so-called Libreville field (an economic theory that emphasizes market self-equilibrium and opposes government intervention) turns out to be false, as is the so-called open software system. Under the premise of Trump's ""America first"" and in the interests of the United States, the United States can forbid others from using what was originally open, deny free trade, and stifle business competition, even for unjustifiable reasons. The article said that this is not only, the United States more prohibited Intel, Qualcomm, Botong and other chip manufacturers to supply parts to Huawei. Similarly, with the US president's ""national security"", these companies can no longer supply Huawei with the aim of curbing the business and development of Huawei's mobile phones and 5G devices. The article points out that when the United States can use administrative means so directly to crack down on commercial competitors, the idea of Libreville and free trade, which the United States has always advocated, has become a big joke. It turns out that these principles will only be used when they are beneficial to the United States.",15 hours ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,785,4815,5.135031847,6,10,,,,,0.08175805676,0.3908970659,positive

Huawei had taken money from the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, China‚Äôs National Security Commission and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network. 3. Huawei received an $8.5 million loan from a state-owned bank, something Huawei denies. 4. The World Bank notes that Chinese Development Bank loaned Huawei $10 billion for overseas expansion in 2004. 5. The Chinese government used Huawei‚Äôs staff to get access codes to infiltrate an unidentified foreign network. It should be noted that the accusations go back years: long before the election of US President Trump and the increasingly aggressive trade war.(To all who thinks Trump is the one who started this issue.) The other aspect of spying allegations to bear in mind is 'potential.' Much of what is said about Huawei is not about whether it spies for China or not, but rather focuses on what it 'could' do. Just like how the NSA planted backdoors in Cisco's products for years, the PLA could theoretically do the same with Huawei, it is argued.",16 hours ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,192,1143,4.958333333,0,3,,,,,-0.007142857143,0.1732142857,negative

The US today looks bad fixing something the West should have fixed a long time ago. Sure the West had enjoyed the cheap tech they otherwise couldn't afford. Huawei ain't innocent.

Huawei can design processors entirely on its own, free from external constraints. Even if Huawei no longer authorizes a new version of Huawei, it can continue to develop on its own on the basis of previous versions. Other EDA chip design tools are the same. Huawei can continue to use them even if it can't continue to get new versions. This leaves time for Huawei. In fact, Huawei has other ways to avoid it, such as outsourcing. Just like you buy a car and you can rebuild the system by yourself, but after-sales is not the follow-up guarantee. This is also the time and space for Huawei to develop itself after the sale. As for Huawei system, even if Huawei does not make its own system, Google will launch Fuchsia OS. Even Samsung actually prepared its own system many years ago, but it was suspended after Google warned. You can see that Samsung's watch is using its own system, so you can see that as factories are expanding their ecosystem {car, mobile phone, computer, etc.). I'm all preparing my backup plan and I don't want to be controlled by Google all the time. I'm glad to see the birth of the ecosystem outside of iOS and Google. Huawei should be as ready as Apple to open its own developer conference. This autumn's conference is the highlight. At the same time, software and architecture authorization belong to service-oriented products. One is that there is no problem of large-scale supply, and I can continue to use them without continuing to supply them, and I have time to continue to improve them. The other is that there is no legal problem, which is also crucial.

Android compatibility, the fastest autumn I have science and technology fantasy 05-2123:10 Huawei self-research operating system ""Hongmeng"" confirmation! Android compatibility, the fastest autumn Recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce listed Huawei as a ""list of entities"", announcing that American enterprises are prohibited from selling high-tech products to Huawei, which directly pushes Huawei ""to Liangshan"". After the incident, Hu Tingbo, president of Huawei Hess, wrote overnight that ""Huawei spare tire chips have all been corrected"", meaning that Hessi Kirin will become Huawei's main chip supplier and get rid of its dependence on American semiconductors. Soon afterwards, people became worried about switching from semiconductors to operating systems, because Google claimed that it had stopped doing some business with Huawei, and Huawei would not be able to use some of its applications in the future. What if Android didn't use them? What if you really don't use Android? In fact, the author has done such an analysis before. Huawei is the third largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and will soon become the second largest. If Huawei cannot use Android, is it not forced to ""self-supporting portal"" Huawei? It's not hard for Huawei to build an operating system in its current strength, but this kind of payment has really happened, and it's hard to say that it won't need Android in the future. Huawei has to keep its hands on it. Huawei has the capital to get rid of Android's self-supporting portal. In March, Huawei's consumer CEO Yu Chengdong said that ""if Huawei had to abandon Windows and Android systems and turn to internal solutions"", as long as Yu Chengdong said that it was very sure, including recently Yu Chengdong also said in his circle of friends that ""Huawei not only has the ability to do core work."" It seems that Huawei's internal ""secret weapon"" is not only chips, but also systems. According to the information on the Internet, Yu Chengdong recently revealed in the group of old friends formed by famous Internet personality Fang Xingdong that as soon as this autumn and as late as next spring, Huawei's OS will probably be on the market. At the same time, Huawei's OS has opened up mobile phones, computers, tablets, televisions, cars, smart wear, and unified into an operating system. That is to say, Huawei has played a big chess game in the system, which has directly opened up many fields. More noteworthy is that Huawei's system will be compatible with Android software.",23 hours ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,415,2587,5.236144578,0,5,23:10,,,,0.08381892231,0.379197995,positive

As a European I want to see hard evidence and proof of claims such as made by the US about Huawei. Without hard proof it is like an economic act of war and the international community should probably sanction the US for it rather than blindly follow. Given that the US is run now by the most obviously lying, self-serving and hypocritical conman ever to be president, my suspicion is that US companies are likely doing as much spying as they claim Huawei is doing, if not more. And even if the companies themselves are not (actively) spying (more so than they are kind of open about, their business model still is to sell access to and information about their users after all), all of the world's data in the cloud is now up for grabs by US authorities under the Cloud Act. It is quite sad to see this shift from international collaboration and trust to nationalistic head bashing. But it does point out an inconvenient truth and as such may ultimately cause improvement.

The same can't be said in China, even Xi said that the law will never be impartial to the party in his state of the union address so there is no denying that. As for who uses my information, I don't see any reason why you would have an issue with the US using your info if you are fine with the Communist regime doing so. The US actually has to adhere to the policies that it sets in doing so, the Communist party of China could murder an entire city and nobody could say anything against them as they have unrivalled power in China. The Chinese companies are already aware that any laws in place could change if the party felt like it at any time. The US is much more like the EU than it would ever be like comparing it to China, China is more similar to Iran and North Korea in how much power they have available to act as they please without any regard to their own laws. Edit: As for information purposes and what Huawei does, we have already been aware of that for years.

As for Huawei, they deserve it. I do not think that Huawei will go bankrupt to this because they are obviously under the direct control of the Communist Party of China. I do hope that it makes them lose their market share abroad, encourages other countries to ban their network infrastructure (along with the company) and for them to reconsider their policies.",1 day ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,182,1081,4.945054945,0,2,,,,,-0.08041666667,0.3370833333,negative

Whenever a tech company in the west releases a product or plans on doing so, it first has to get the money to start advertising it and making it look good from a competive point of view. So, conclusively, companies need to save up enough money to plan for products, make them have good quality and producing them. In China, companies like Huawei are sponsored DIRECTLY by the government of China. That basically means that the reason why they have become so famous and big in western markets is not really just because of good marketing, but because they were financially unlimited. They can do whatever they want from a financial perspective and dont need to focus on basic business aspects. Aspects, which are essentially for Western companies. If they dont have enough money, capacities and ressources to fastly build up 5G infrastructure, they cant accept the offer, whereas Huawei just goes to chinese government, asks for some millions or billions more and is just fine. Of course, this policy isnt really what I want. But seeing it from the perspective mentioned above I certainly DO understand that US companies are prohibited from dealing with Huawei (and likely much more coming) If you disagree or have legitimate proof that I'm wrong, comment and share your proof.

The US is really pushing its allies to restrict Huawei in their countries, but given the lack of evidence and rising tensions with the US, the EU is still largely planning to go ahead with Huawei 5G purchases. We will just have to wait and see where this goes, but I'm not optimistic on having a resolution until early 2021. China has a massive population and a command economy. They can manipulate their currency and shift production to other industries to weather tariffs and bans for years if need be.

It goes way beyond 5g and smartphones or tech... If Trump is willing to sacrifice that much of the sales income of US companies, China Is willing to face a crisis with some employments and sacrifice people and companies in order to protect their own brands, their political power and their greatest chinesse company that has become such a reference not only in chinesse soil, but worldwide. They are like the chinesse flagship company in the world. I mean, thid can actually turn things into a very dangerous direction where we have to take into consideration one thing: it has been about 5 years of WW3 chit chat, and this move from the US can make China do something to escalate things and that can get us in a very dangerous territory considering all the dues and interests between both countries.

The US Govt is known to intercept electronics to modify them with spyware and hardware backdoors. Huawei is just a pressure point for trade negotiations with China. Huawei has done everything they can to assure everyone their systems aren't compromised. They've allowed inspections, offered assurances, etc. If anything were found, they'd lose ALL their business, so it profits them nothing to include backdoors, and so far nothing has been found. Some say the very nature of 5G technology would allow Huawei to inject malware at a later date undetected, but if that's true, then so could any provider. I wouldn't put it past China to try to leverage their tech to spy on other governments, but I also know that Huawei is under a microscope and once their reputation is tarnished for spying, they won't get a 2nd chance in the marketplace which will drop them immediately.

Despite the obvious grammatical errors, which I'll just overlook (despite your name) and assume it was just a rushed edit, and say that you need to think about the effect this has beyond the handful of Google Apps. *Enthusiast's answer would be to just root and side load those apps. But that means that other apps, which won't work if you're rooted, are gone now (while you can trick some apps into believing you're not rooted when you are it's all a hassle). All of that said - you'd still have to be an enthusiast, because the majority of the market would never go through all of that. *You'd also have to trick Google into believing you're device isn't what it is, if they decide to be dicks. But what's really at the core of this are things that we can't even know yet. We actually won't know the full implications until they release a new device (hopefully it'll never come to that). Once they've lost all of their peripherals etc. It's like saying you'd buy an iPhone, even if it had a horrible screen, slow processor, inability to connect with the radio bands needed for your ISP, slow RAM etc etc etc. This is just as much about the hardware, as it is about software.

1930,jqueryrocks,UgxwACujeW4FIxgHKRh4AaABAg,"If Huawei rolls out a new OS, now it's probably a great time. I know Android may already have 1 million apps out there, but I mean come on, how many apps do you really have on your phone? I believe the apps we are using on a daily basis are mostly within the top 500 list. Plus, nowadays, a lot of apps are built with hybrid techs (PhoneGap, React Native, etc) so, it would not be so hard for app dev companies to make a new variant. Google could burn itself with this move. UPDATE: Just saw a press release from Huawei, their own OS (also open source) will be available this fall, it will compatible with all existing Android apps, so no redevelopment needed. I see some people in the replies say a new OS won't be succeeded since the MS Windows Phone failed years ago. So I need to point out that Windows Phone's failure is a result of 3 major reasons: 1) Significantly different user experience (also inferior) than iOS/Android. 2) Lacks big manufacturer support 3) Compatibility issue. Those 3 problems won't exist in Huawei's case. 1) The user experience will remain the same as their existing modified-android OS. 2) Huawei is a major player itself and highly likely we will see support from MI, OnePlus, Meizu, etc. Well, basically, all big players except Samsung and Apple. 3) Compatible with all existing Android apps. If Google doesn't allow Huawei to bundle with their apps (Gmail, Maps), just install them separately with the APK files. Maybe it will cost your extra 10 minutes.

However, your hesitation about the political struggle between these two nations just reflects what US government's complicated conclusion about China - You don't know if you should eliminate this ""honest"" potential friend, or defend this ""threat"" before it's too late. The fact is, China is always an option of both. They want all the other countries to become its dependence, to accept its ridiculous totalism ideology. They could be a friend to the ones who follow this totalism ideology or a threat to the ones who didn't agree. This duality of China's global strategy made it a very difficult rival, it is both your enemy and friend at the same time. But always remember its goal had never changed - to become the only leader of the world following its own ideology. The things you mentioned, the achievement China had reached, were mostly built on its totalism ideology. Foxcon workers had suffered a lot to produce cheap and stable iPhone for the world, and Huawei workers as well. You can even found suicidal news from both of these two companies even on the Chinese newspaper in the past decades very often. If this is the cost of the global trade goal and international influence, was it worth for? So I hereby conclude as you mentioned: This is a war. But it's not only about one company, or one industry.

The United States finally achieved a tactical victory in the war with the 1985 Plaza Accord when the U.S. argued that it and Japan should abandon the fixed exchange rates that had prevailed after the Second World War. The result was that U.S. imports dropped in price as the dollar fell and Japan entered the bubble economy, which would lead to the Lost Decade. Japan' economy never recovered from this.

Because there were separatists on Youtube trying to overthrow a legit government and China asked for a content filtering for the sake of national security, as all the countries have been doing including the US. However, Google refused to do so and got banned. Initially Google redirected their server into HongKong to keep running business under the hood. Why Microsoft, Amazon, Apple are not banned? Why Bing search works perfectly fine in China? Google basically threw itself outta China because it wouldn't abide by the laws. That being said, what has Huawei done wrong? Backdoors or spyware?

However, with the quick transition we had with 2G, 3G then 4G, investors and marketers pressured the industry for the next big thing. To answer, we implemented VoLT (Voice over LTE) and WiFi calling, but this wasn't enough. Then came 5G. However, 5G from a technical perspective is not feasible in the US due to the average free-space path distances and LoS limitations at the frequencies initially proposed. This is why US companies are not invested in building out 5G-it simply won't reliably work here, engineers know this. China can likely deploy it due to the population density there, but here it simply won't work except for perhaps convention centers and other high traffic locations. Also do not be fooled by AT&T's 5G network -- since the terms '2G, 3G, 4G and 5G' are not regulated, AT&T simply renamed their 4G network by calling it '5G.'",1 day ago (edited),isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,165,946,4.739393939,0,17,,,,,-0.007745098039,0.3609663866,negative

Thank about it in logical terms how are they pushing so far ahead when they should have the same amount of funds and same amount of intelligent people as each other it's very simple they're being backed by an external force or thats what our government believes imagine having China as your personal bank account aslong as you can get 5G out before anyone else why because China wants the Technology first just like we want it first. Then theirs the fact that the CEO of Huawei 100% had ties with the Counter Intelligence of China as in he legit worked there it's far to many what ifs and theirs unfair play happening when it shouldn't be.

Thing is amazingly this happens after meeting with Google and ""Tim Apple"". Apples sales in China has started to drop and they also lost to Huawei as no 2 smartphone seller. Here is the deal, US does not want competition when it comes to 5G, Huawei invested billions and about 3-5 years ahead of everyone else. This is not about national security, because mind you NSA, CIA, FBI all spy not only on Americans but everyone in the world, especially ""ALLIES"" if anyone remembers Merkel being tapped, while hiding it from everyone and blaming other nations for something they do themselves. Here is the deal they do not want competition, they do not want fair game. If CIA and NSA are so good at what they do, where is the proof of Huawei spying? Nothing? Surely as in a court of law, everything needs to be backed up by facts. Anyone remembers Iraq having WMD? Powel with his little bottle in US showing it as a proof? Lybia? Russian meddling? Where is a single piece of evidence. Now thinking rationally, how does Huawei become a bigger threat than Iran or North Korea, ISIS etc? They are not punishing Huawei as a whole, they are punishing smartphone users so they can switch (hopefully to Apple). Shame on Google that could not find a way, not challenge them in court. Then again considering insane censorship that Google is pushing in their search together with bias that has already been proven. This does not surprise me.

This is tacit admittance that the disruption this will cause for both in the US and with US allies will be pretty big. I have a theory: With this ban Trump is bluffing and never really planned on going all the way through with the ban, but he's so unpredictable(for better or for worse) that the CCP won't risk not capitulating on some level. Trump also knows that the hardliners of Xi's regime will try to influence him to push back at the U.S and escalate things, even if it hurts them economically(see Iran and N.Korea). An escalation can lead to global economic slow down which will affect the U.S economy and jobs, his approval ratings and his chances of getting reelected so even he will capitulate on some level. G20 summit in Japan is in June and they(Trump and Xi) will likely meet and iron things out... somewhat.

The problem with banning Apple from China is something that can't be done because of 3 reasons: 1- Banning Apple in China will force one of the biggest electronic manufacturer on the planet to fire tens of thousands of people, and we are talking of a market where the government promised that will always give jobs to people. 2- Foxconn IS NOT a Chinese manufacturer is a Taiwanese one, Taiwan can easily use their Indian (not sure if they're up and running yet) factories to manufacture iPhones only since they own the technology that makes them already. 3- China is a country based on face, iPhone is a status symbol, having the latest iPhone is the way to really flex on other people. Take that away and the people would not be happy. I'm an expat living in China, so I can see how and what is going on and, even if I'm not American, I can understand where the trade war and all this problems come from. This measures come after China declined and revised the entire trade agreement, while up in the US they used to have a real free market until some months ago. Is not easy to comment on this without getting super political, but in all honesty this can go only in 2 ways. 1- fix everything when China finally decides to follow an agreement 2- get your rifle ready, because it will go down pretty pretty fast.. As for competition, I can't speak about NA in general, but in Europe Huawei has been a major player since forever albeit in the high/mid and not the flagship segment.

4236,MAANI IBLIS,UgymUCElzYIyNtfF56x4AaABAg,"It sucks for Huawei. The US ban will compromise the company's dealings with many of the services provided by other companies based in the United States including Google and the android platform on smartphones set to release later this year. We are to blame for the rise of Chinese manufacturing prowess. Many American companies began manufacturing in China giving incentives to China to partner up for mutual benefit where they supply the cheap labor while building industries. This allowed for Chinese manufacturing to advance at a faster pace especially considering the population. The Chinese government has made sure that they have Chinese people who are working in these factories. Here is a harsh truth nobody seems to want to admit: corporate espionage is practiced daily by companies from all different countries and government espionage is a certainty. China has abetted companies who have stolen intellectual property and patents. An example is Microsoft Windows being used without licensing from Microsoft, in China... Would you have trouble saying I'm not buying crude oil from Putin even though my society is in desperate need of gasoline from Russia if that were the case? My honest opinion is that most people wouldn't support money going to Putin. The double standard applies here only because the difference is we have a better idea of the inner workings of the Russian government, and are ignorant of the inner workings of the Chinese government. We therefore are left thinking that China is the place where most of ""my products"" come from that save me money plus there stuff is as good as Japanese stuff used to be... This isn't the actual case. Let's look at what the standards for an employee are as an employee in Japan versus China, world's of differences as well as regulatory practices and laws. In the end it comes down to this: if Putin was pushing for Russian currency to become the World monetary currency people would rail that he is a corrupt enemy dictator. Tanks running over students during protests... all forgotten, at least now you can leave Russia much more easily than the USSR, leave China and you are considered a Chinese asset abroad by the Chinese government akin to the glorious KGB days of the USSR. I don't trust Huawei, Samsung, Apple, Google... Governments they will use your information and they will spy and companies want opportunities to make more money and will use personal info. You see my family came here from Russia after living under the communist regime. My friends from China are not so endeared to China. China shows the same propensities as the USSR in exertion of its perceived borders. If I wouldn't trust Putin and wouldn't want Russian currency to become the world monetary currency I wouldn't want the alternatively better organized Communist dictatorship to have their currency placed instead of Russia. I believe communist ideology antithetical to the way our societies wish to function. Communism is yet another anachronism in our society. Canadian companies including BlackBerry have had issues with vulnerabilities from way back. Companies including Huawei and other suppliers of Canadas 4G equipment and antennas have had backdoors found and dealt with behind closed doors by companies buying the products. The telecom Giants, the big 3, have hidden some of the shadier practices behind closed boardroom doors. Huawei had once been in a particular instance in Italy, that recently noted how there was a lengthy dialogue surrounding the backdoors found in their telecommunications equipment and how there were multiple instances of such behavior and how long it took to resolve. The fact is that Huawei was pretty shady and didn't immediately fulfill promises to remove backdoors. If it were leaked that these instances have been repeated when the Huawei tech was under scrutiny in many other countries by telecom companies making purchases for 4G networks, people would be very unhappy. Unfortunately telecommunications companies are trying to make billions and don't want to spend more money to begin their 5G networks, hence they will likely be untruthful and downplay the threat possibilities and deny that they have in some instances found vulnerabilities related to backdoors but resolved the issue in private in a manner they found acceptable. We tend to be a society based on perception rather than truth and the belief that a good PR campaign can cure the perception the public has of a particular thing in any instance. We rely heavily on Chinese products so hopefully our ""devil's"" ('elected' political leaders)will work out the trade war and we will have a deal. Huawei being put in the penalty box is ok if you are playing the same game, hopefully it will not be long before resolution is found.",1 day ago (edited),isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,788,4781,5.068527919,0,13,,,,,0.03937585734,0.3732853224,positive

I can't help thinking that the situation is more political than anything else. I heard China had bought the US's bad debt during the Clinton and Obama eras. I was also hearing stories that China was prepared to drop the US debt by passing it onto unwary 3rd parties at 10 cents for each dollar, to get some return on buying a bad product would be better than nothing after all. China also quite astutely negotiated access to the American markets as part of the debt restructuring of the US! I think what this is about is in part that Trump was trying to force Huawei to deliver backdoors as part of the rollout of 5G in the US. Aren't the NSA demanded/requested backdoors in modern telecommunications equipment an open secret now? So I guess Huawei weren't wanting to play ball. After all look at South Korea where 5G has been available for some time now; where's the dodgy equipment outburst from the Koreans - there is none. I think this is all about Trump using the one skill he has, which is surviving bad debt/ bankruptcy, you just need to look at his own financial dealings! You need to go back at least 20 years or so that to see the signs that perhaps inform a particular story. All Trump is doing is entrenching in the only way available to him, (even H Clinton would have to have done the same also if she'd been elected). Pretty good analysis/discussion though, I really enjoyed this particular vlog of yours. Moving on a bit Huawei happened to have had a head start in investing in future technologies. They should be allowed to reap the benefits of their prudent forward thinking. Doesn't Trump sound like a bully in the playground saying to a quietly confident person, you've made this newfangled toy and I want it, even if I didn't do anything in creating it - but by Trumps own self proclaimed rights, that it should be his, But your right it doesn't bode well for so called free markets, even in and for the west.",1 day ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,370,2039,4.513513514,2,16,,,,,0.1244727891,0.536377551,positive

Like, it was one person who made the borders of a country and everyone in it is saying ""yup, that should be like this and all others aren't allowed."" I mean, I don't think the world was born with borders right? It's literally made up by a few which everyone has to follow.

This, however, is my opinion and you have yours, so no hate please. Also, I'm not trying to be rude but I like Chinese novels a lot with Wuxia or modern backgrounds. Yet, when I read the ones with modern settings and background, the CMs are fully blind af.

But as soon as ""foreigners"" come into the picture, the MC hates them to the core and says China is number one while having numerous Chinese officials trying to kill him.

4608,Ë∞¢ÊòäÂ§©,Ugz6kr13StjCdm6nIf94AaABAg,"Someone brought up a point that the existence of Samsung destroys the argument that the US kills foreign companies competing with the US ones. Have a look at this link https://www.samsung.com/global/ir/stock-information/ownership-structure/ If you look at Samsung‚Äôs ownership structure, you can see that Samsung has the majority of their stock held by foreign investors, more specifically people/organizations on Wall Street, like Citi group, Morgan Stanley etc. The reason why Samsung isn‚Äôt banned and is allowed access to core technologies is obvious, it is basically American. Unlike Huawei, which is not a publicly traded company, and therefore is 100% privately owned by Chinese, consequently the US has literally 0 control over. If you wonder why it is this way, I‚Äôll let you in on some history, after the 1997 Asian economic crisis, which was caused by the US to suppress economic growth in Asian countries like Korea, Samsung was broken into many subsidiaries and sold off to pay off their debt. For instance their heavy industrial department was sold to Volvo, Pharmaceutical department to Johnson Wax, LED to GE etc. after taking into account all the cross holding of interest, 55% of the current Samsung conglomerate is foreign, and mostly American. It was only after it is Americanized, it successfully globalized, whereas despite of its massive influence in Korea before the crisis, it was never truly global and never pierced into the most technologically advanced industries as one of the top contenders. If you look at globally successful companies in Asia, especially the biggest ones of a certain country/region like Mitsubishi of Japan, TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of S Korea etc. they almost always had their controlling interest being American, or else they wouldn‚Äôt be allowed by the US to become anything significant. And those companies, like Samsung, also became American after a US caused economic crisis. Except in China, where the biggest companies are either state owned or Chinese owned and successfully survived multiple economic crisis basically unscathed. I‚Äôll let you figure of why the US is so afraid China and want to takedown Huawei at the risk of losing their hypocritical outlook of righteousness. Huawei might not succeed, but it is a martyr, and it‚Äôs legacy will be significant and meaningful for any non-American own companies forward.",1 day ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,377,2373,5.297082228,2,11,,https://www.samsung.com/global/ir/stock-information/ownership-structure/,,,0.1448606272,0.4045876887,positive

4850,Gu Yewen,UgxirW1HZkI3In3i8l14AaABAg,"Good video Lew. To be honest, I am not worried about Huawei too much. Will they slow down their growth, yes. Will they shut down? No. The main reason Huawei can have a fight in this game is that the market in China is so big. 60% of the 4G stations on this planet are in China and this number may be even higher with 5G. Also the one of the largest smart phone market. I am from China and have been to US and Europe and I know the 4G coverage difference between the west and China, especially in rural area. So even if Huawei just serve the demand in China only, it will be just fine. And of couse, it got many EU and south east asia and middle east orders. The smartphone department is actually affacted least in this US bullying. The chip design tool you mentioned, there are some open source tool which is less efficient than the US ones but free to use. Other banned chips can be sourced else where too, but much less advanced of course. Some produced locally in China already. But with Huawei such a new big customer, the stock price of these local chip producers in China skyrocket these days. And it is possible they will invest more in R&D with the money from Huawei and become more advanced in the future. The key issue is the laptop department. Huawei laptop actually grows very quick these years. But without Intel or AMD. It is pretty dead for now. But there is very strong discussion that Huawei may release its own OS since no one will buy its phone without GOOGLE PLAY anyway. And at least the local apps in China will 100% sure adapt to this OS due to the government presure. In the oversea market, it is hard to say. Therefore, there may be laptop with kirin chips and Huawei OS in the future, just like the macs. You cant imagine the national sentiment in China about Huawei now.

In 60's USA banned Japanese car makers because they are simply destroying US cars with their reliability, prices and low gas mileage ... US did ban their competition from 1945 in fact ... but you obviously not familiar with History at all. I can give you tens of examples for US banning competition in different branches.

They are the only company though that has another OS , and a really good , stable and advanced one Android without Google is pretty much trash so IOS would be the only real choice in this case. They would make billions just having their software on Huawei devices which do sell pretty well globally. On the other hand ,This whole bill is made to slow down Huawei(which is China's best way of making money in the US and it's far too advanced in the 5g territory .) so boosting Apple while keeping Huawei on the spot makes sense and the bill i think only bans hardware supplies from the US specifically .

That is to say, it is a communist company, that is to say it is a branch of their totalitarian government. They do not operate like American/European/Free Market companies, and the issue of Spyware and threat from that is serious. They are a country with a completely different ideology that is at odds with the West. 2) A Free Market is not totally free, the same way Free Speech doesn't mean you can threaten people. A Free Market is free, within THE RULES THAT EVERYONE ABIDES BY. If you engage in illegal activity, whether that is spying on a country or making dangerous products for the people without disclosing them, then you are NOT FREE from the law. On top of that, point to another market as free as America's. Just do it, I'm curious. And if you think they are being hypocrites and are too stupid to debate and argue within the nuance of complex systems, then what are you suggesting? Anarchy? No rules, every one is free to do what they want? Or are you just a pawn of ideology, liking things when they go your way and not when they dont? The same people shitting on Trump for blacklisting a suspicious Chinese company, a communist regime, most likely also cheered on the liberals for trying to impeach him on BS they made up about him working for the Russians. Which is it? Is Trump bad or good? Should the government protect against dangerous products, or should everything be pure capitalism, free markets with no regulation and no laws?

As for US spying on it's citizen. Continental US (CONUS) belongs to FBI. With a warrant they can surveil any US citizen.

Unlike Huawei, which is not a publicly traded company, and therefore is 100% privately owned by Chinese, consequently the US has literally 0 control over. If you wonder why it is this way, I‚Äôll let you in on some history, after the 1997 Asian economic crisis, which was caused by the US to suppress economic growth in Asian countries like Korea, Samsung was broken into many subsidiaries and sold off to pay off their debt. For instance their heavy industrial department was sold to Volvo, Pharmaceutical department to Johnson Wax, LED to GE etc. after taking into account all the cross holding of interest, 55% of the current Samsung conglomerate is foreign, and mostly American. It was only after it is Americanized, it successfully globalized, whereas despite of its massive influence in Korea before the crisis, it was never truly global and never pierced into the most technologically advanced industries as one of the top contenders. If you look at globally successful companies in Asia, especially the biggest ones of a certain country/region like Mitsubishi of Japan, TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of S Korea etc. they almost always had their controlling interest being American, or else they wouldn‚Äôt be allowed by the US to become anything significant. And those companies, like Samsung, also became American after a US caused economic crisis. Except in China, where the biggest companies are either state owned or Chinese owned and successfully survived multiple economic crisis basically unscathed. I‚Äôll let you figure of why the US is so afraid China and want to takedown Huawei at the risk of losing their hypocritical outlook of righteousness.",1 day ago,isthistheendofhuawei,asKteF1Jn_c,326,2078,5.377300613,2,9,,https://www.samsung.com/global/ir/stock-information/ownership-structure/,,,0.124034749,0.3807593308,positive

Create new OS (they already work on new software last 5 years) 2. Reactivate bootloader unlock code service and just let users to decide what they want 3. To pay for OS some other company like Xiaomi or better OnePlus - Corse this means the price of devices will be increased, but not tu much 4. To do something of this and drop the price of their awesome devices 5. Still to use Android via AOSP but withouth this Google apps. They can create some other apps on same rom. 6. To use AOSP and let users for flashing (Option 1. unlock bootloaders) Google GAPPS on their devices or creating some compatibile GAPPS for flashing through stock recovery or someedited recovery by Huawei.... 7. Start co-operation wich some developers of custom roms like Resurrection, Mokee... And creating some new EMUI rom and update using stock recovery... I know, most of this need time, but Huawei have all time because they release last P30 series already and this Google decision dosent hurt this series and older. I am someone who will use some new OS simillar to Android but better wich more features. Mabey OS wich Root preinstalled premission or Magisk module... Why not? What Google did, now most of Android users hate them. They attack seccond Android phone company. Google now can lose big, mabey biggest market if users stay and support Huawei whatever Huawei decide to do. Me personally hope we will see the birth of new OS on market and lower prices for devices.

Commies are different, to put it lightly. For them to act like they act is understandable, given their political regime. But what about the rest of us? Are we still all fucking morons in it for ourselves, because we all act like we're not (but we all know we are), like we're all so civilized in comparison. Don't get me wrong, I have worked under Huawei, I have seen first hand the negatives but also the positives. You have no fucking idea how dedicated and professional they are, especially in the telecom branch, and that's why they are #1. That's why every other technology by comparison feels like it belongs in the Stone age. I wonder if Ericsson or Nokia will ever beat them now. But don't get it twisted, they dont do it out of benevolence. Like any other company, they provide services for their own benefit, and since China is a communist country, that means it is in the benefit of the country. And it's because they're communists that they have such strict security policies (and I have experienced them fully). They're in it for themselves, but at least their political ideology reflects that, which can't be said about the rest of us. The US spies and destroys whatever it wants, but it pretends is the angel or freedom and god knows what else. The US are the definition of hypocrisy. I don't have any horse in this race, humanity is a lost cause and the majority of the people can't sleep at night if they don't exercise their right of free speech, ending up spewing absolute garbage. It is still so unfortunate to see how privileged the US appears in comparison to China and Russia. We're already being spied by Google, we don't want the Chinese aswell.

Maybe I'm just American, but I can't believe we would attach these two companies based solely on the larger picture. I agree though, there needs to be some evidence brought to light.
