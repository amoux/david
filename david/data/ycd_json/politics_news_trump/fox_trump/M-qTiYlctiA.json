Trump wanted the full denuclearization so Kim wanted the full lift of sanctions. Sounds fair so far. So what was the Problem? By keeping the sanctions up, people are at the risk of starving over there. The nuclear program is the only card NKorea can play and a card they have worked on for a decade. The deal - as they wanted it - was the only option (partly/partly | fully/fully). Why didn't they just make it? I get why they didn't lift the sanctions fully yet, but then you just can't demand the full denuclearization as well... That's just the obvious. So as it stands, this wasn't more than a step back and a waste of money and time. Nontheless I'm happy they are talking at all. And I have the highest hopes for another meeting. Though then, lift some sanctions already! And may it just be for the poor peoples sake...﻿", "time": "8 hours ago", "author": "Pedo Bear"}

Why look a gift horse in the mouth.  Trump excepted and received an oval office which he knew he didn't earn or deserve.  He never believed he would  or could win.  Even after being in the office for a while he kept saying I'm president can you believe it, which he knew was definitely unbelievable by so many.  But he underestimated how gullible Americans are and how much education is liking in this country and I'm sure he's very grateful.  He appreciated the lack of education that's why he placed Betsy DeVos over the education system to make sure it stayed that way.

NK knows that if they actually fired a live warhead targeting a foreign asset, it would be game over for the whole country.  Not to mention, the only time NK has ever openly threatened the US with a potential nuclear strike has been under Trump's administration in 2017, despite Trump's claims that we were closer to war under Obama.\n\nOn Trump's \"deal-closing:\" it's obvious he owes most of what he has to his father, from inheriting his already successful real estate business, to numerous gifts and loans totaling many millions.  He would have been an absolute failure if he wasn't able to maintain profits with a system already staffed and networked to do so and deep-pocketbooks to buffer it when it teeters.  All of his other failed enterprises, defaulted loans, and bankruptcies speak against his personal ability as a salesman/businessman in general, but he does have some skill in building and selling his \"brand\" (mostly through dishonestly inflating successes and values).

Trump & Son, was renamed The Trump Organization.  Real good job with that one.  I also love how the go-to is always \"most successful people have failures and bankruptcies.\"  Sure, some do, but successful people rarely default on so many high-value loans that they become blacklisted by all major US banks - you have to both fail enormously at your business ventures and have a serious record of not paying what's owed for that.  If Trump wasn't bailed out by the banks in the 90's (to protect their own interests) his business would have completely tanked.\n\nBetween loans (mostly un-repaid), gifts, and inheritance, Fred Trump gave Donald over $400M.  This is now public knowledge.\nAgain, Trump rebounded from the 90's and 2000's by selling his brand, not by being an expert real estate developer.  He put a lot of effort into convincing everyone, including those he was in business with, that he was worth more than he was - that the \"Trump\" brand represented elite, high-class value - and he found buyers because people still believed him.\nIt doesn't matter if you want to disregard this public information as \"hateful Trump news,\" because the majority of it is derived from court records, Trump family tax returns, and bank receipts.﻿", "time": "2 hours ago", "author": "Lacidios"}

You're mistaking the difference between companies, necessary for the success of the US economy, failing due to the success of foreign imports and Trump's inability to manage and account for his own opulence.  Not only did Trump not make good with the banks after recouping his losses, he threatened the banks in an extortionate manner in order to pay for his mistakes.  It can be said of the auto manufacturers that they didn't plan enough for an evolving industry, but it can also be said that since Trump put very little of his own money into his ventures (despite claiming to be and being hailed as a 'billionaire'), his failures burdened himself the least - something he was aware of as he continued to use the same tactic several more times as an exploit of federal law.

So, you start with an admission you had no real basis for what you said previously, then you continue with misinformation and an inability to grasp what a real estate developer is.

Donald worked for his father's company before being made president of the same company (not his own enterprise).  New construction and remodeling of rental housing remained the bulk of the Trump Organization's real estate development and management until Donald branched out to casinos and hotels.
