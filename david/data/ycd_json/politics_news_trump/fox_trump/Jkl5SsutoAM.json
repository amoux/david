{"cid": "UgwWvWuvI1A1gFyQINJ4AaABAg", "text": "You know what.. something positive...  I can honestly say, I have learned probably 10years worth of history( actions, influence, technology, media, strategy, foreign affairs, political influences, agendas,deamenors,schedules,languages) , the real thing how it has happened, how it repeated its self in the past, the process, ive learned that, from over excessive campaign,  including \"all investigations\" stuff, that was a pretty big part of influence in the past.   \"Basically how to influence a whole country\"    in about a year I learned it, a little more\n\nBefore that year, I was on this ancient belief, discoverer, re learning things influences and abilities, on my own block scheduling as I call it, but started to put all that together,  its a pretty strong influence now..   ancient stuff,  I believe anything, I don't have to read a book to figure out, so to speak.\n\n\nSo I started this off thinking,  to write  \"voting doesn't matter\"  or to question why \"voting matters\", what it fits in on the system,   because I can influence any part of the government, like senators congressmen, that's easy stuff, to make shots called, to create things..   type stuff TGB the way I mean it.    Its easy to as a \"American\" to do this, because you have Political Parties, like Democrat,  Republican that campaigned, that rely on things , other people to do there job,give them information, tell them what to say, or what words or slogans are cool. The simple stuff.    And especially, the influence that allows somebody to get away with something....  sentators, go for that one hook line and sinker everytime, specially if means \"less work\", or more temporary success.  TGB the way I mean it.\n\n\n\nThe way you guys are operating.  it seems to me, to tell you that its very important that you be American,   more the than republican, or democrat.    This is why,  when you guys make it all about politics,   it almost eliminates  any position or job title campaigned for.    SO like say you have a couple governors  who are die hard republican or democrat, have deep in there state or system.  Its almost completely eliminates, the constructiveness of the \"position\" of being governor.    It becomes Republican or Democrat..   So creating a influence line that carries decisions, biased , intelegence, influence through out a country, happends pretty quickly, very easily,    the borders of our states are kind of erased, and replaced with republican or democrat.  Just one big sea of constant voting so to speak.  but nothing ever fuckin happends, unless someintellegence influence is involved to tip scale, because we go 50-50 on a lot of things...   So it takes somebody like me, with my abilities my knowledge,  to influence things ( im good at getting everybody together on something by theway, I don't really have to tip scale, I can make a burst...  but tipping is very very easy...     What it means is... Im better at it than the politicians TGB the way I mean it.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Tyler Barker"}

This Jesus came as God and gave his life so the veil would be broken.  From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.  Jesus never spoke any hate especially not towards the samaritans.  The parable of who is my neighbor and the samaritan woman who was asked for water by Jesus are prime examples of this.  Trump spews hate, racism, blasphemy, and creates division among people.  You're right, trump is allowed to be elected by Gods will alone.  The leaders who are elected today are meant to speed the process of the end of times.  As a follower of Christ, and a son of God, I don't possibly see how this man can be a child of God.  I do pray for him however so that he may not perish.  The Holy Spirit that lives in me can sense that this man is only a means for the speeding of the end of times.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Eduardo Castaneda"}

But illegal immigrants take the scut work, the jobs that pay next to nothing. The jobs Americans don't want to do. So what's the problem?\nAm I the only person to notice that the WHOLE story has changed! \nWe're not building the wall to protect jobs, because the President now says we NEED immigrants to fill jobs. \nAnd we know that every survey done shows illegal immigrants are per capita, no more likely to commit violent crime than the average American citizen.\nSO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS ALL ABOUT?Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Rumi900"}

{"cid": "Ugz1e_n_Gn-8NcIPpsx4AaABAg", "text": "At the federal level, the impeachment process is a two-step procedure. The House of Representatives must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles of impeachment, which constitute the formal allegation or allegations. Upon passage, the defendant has been \"impeached\". Next, the Senate tries the accused. In the case of the impeachment of a president, the Chief Justice of the United States presides over the proceedings. For the impeachment of any other official, the Constitution is silent on who shall preside, suggesting that this role falls to the Senate's usual presiding officer, the President of the Senate who is also the Vice President of the United States.\n\nIn theory at least, as President of the Senate, the Vice President of the United States could preside over their own impeachment, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in their own case would be a blatant conflict of interest. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the President pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nTo convict an accused, \"the concurrence of two thirds of the members present\" is required.[40] Conviction removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring him or her from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. Conviction by the Senate does not bar criminal prosecution. Even after an accused has left office, it is possible to disqualify the person from future office or from certain emoluments of his prior office (such as a pension).Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Dan Fremont"}

A reporter walking with them asked why they came And they said because of the ads in their country ‚ÄúCome to America. We need you for jobs. When you get here vote for the Liberal Democrats who welcomed you.‚Äù  Because so many Americans did not want to vote for them they need these immigrant votes. Trump does welcome immigrants to come: but to come legally as the instant access is not fair to those waiting months, even years, for due process  because they desire legal access. Since the President came into office, he has created 4 point 5 Million jobs, 4 point 3 Million Americans off food stamps, 4 Million Americans out of poverty, and, a path towards energy and independence. America is itself a Republic which it fought hard to attain. I do not belong to your country so see it objectively on both sides and am pleased America has produced such a great man who went  personally to other leaders to make peace  through trade with those who were enemies which gives the rest of us the hope for peace.

The top two vote getters in the primaries were both Democrats, and they are both on the ballot. The east coast while liberal establishment is running 85 year old Dianne Feinstein --- again. But those 'uppity\" \"La Razas\" also ran someone and all two million illegal aliens voted for him. So this is the person who is on the ballot challenging Feinstein. Just the two of them. Normally Feinstein would win. But Republicans are angry at Feinstein for what she did to Brett Kavanaugh. If enough Republicans vote for her opponent, she will lose her reelection. But it does not stop there. It gets better. Chuck Schumer will have an ineffective, difficult to handle, rogue player on his hands -- who has an agenda and is not a team player.. If enough California Republicans figure this out and vote for the \"La Raza\" candidate, Feinstein could lose.  That is all.  Thanks.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Colin Kelley"}

We have a President who speaks directly to the people honestly, without political correctness, and limited sensitivity. We are strong.

He is just making it up. And there is not going to be any such plan, either, however much congressional Republicans may have spent time pretending to get on board with the president‚Äôs idea.\n\nWe know this because Trump and the GOP have an actual tax bill that is not only written but has already passed the House of Representatives. If Republicans hold the House in November, they will pass this real tax bill again. And if they gain seats in the United States Senate, they will stand a chance of passing it there, too. The real tax bill is not a middle-class tax cut ‚Äî it‚Äôs a huge windfall for the rich. Try telling me otherwise please. \n\nThere is a kind of entertaining randomness to the things Trump says and does. The president decides it would be smart to start pretending that he‚Äôs working on a middle-class tax cut, so he just blurts it out with no preparation. Everyone else in the Republican Party politics knows that when Trump starts lying about something, their job is to start covering for him.\n\nBut because Trump is disorganised, and most people aren‚Äôt as shameless as Trump is, it usually takes a few days for the ducks to get in a row.

And I don't even know if the people come up with the plan if the local governments will even approve it. Personally complaining and complaining and arguing about everything isn't going to get anything done.

I'm sure I know more these families and girls than the average person. And I've met the really nice Mexican drug Runners that don't use the drugs because they send it to their family the money that they've earned. In the meantime we have an opiate problem here.

How many homeless people did Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein and Maxine waters take in and care for?  It was Jimmy Carter who created this mess to begin with.  Even if every single person with financial means went out and picked up every WILLING homeless person to give them a job and a place to live (which is impossible) there problem would still NOT be solved.  Because of the laws passed by Jimmy Carter and his fellow socialists, it is against the law to force mentally unstable people take their meds!  They used to be behind walls in nice rooms and they were given their meds diligently.  Those days are gone.  Most of the homeless out there fall into the category of mentally ill.  Furthermore, most of hem will NOT go into shelters.  Now go take your meds and shut the hell up.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "george george"}
