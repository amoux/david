So yeah, your Android phone can be almost identical as the Pixel, plus every brand's own advantages (In this case Super Slow mo, 4K60, Super steady, Timelapse, but most importantly PRO mode).\nSo, if you're experienced enough both cameras you'll know when the Google Camera will do better and when the Stock will do better, as a result you're gonna get almost always the very best shot that your phone can ever get.Ôªø", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Z-Funky '"}

I had first paid $200 for a brand new in box V20, but they sent the wrong carrier, so I decided to return it for a refund & get the 'Like New' Sprint version, saving $80. I ended up with a screen burned phone that was more like a 7/10 condition, exchanged it 2x with the same seller, ending up with an even more screen burned Verizon version that's barely tolerable for recording video, not much else...

Since then my phone never lags and considering how i have used 60% of my 32gb of storage space its surprising how well it still runs and how well optimized it must be to still last a whole day of charge typically ending the night with 15% after heavy usage before during and after school. Considering you have an s8 you must not have used any of the newer iphone or samsung phones and if you have used an iphone it would have been an older version such as the 5 or 4 so im not sure what experience you have to judge these phones in their newer states. In my opinion i believe samsung is better (see how i am specific to the phone brand and not the OS) just because of the fact that my phone is working at a high standard after 3 years where as my mum who owns a iphone 6s since 2016 like myself is incapable of lasting a day on 100% charge and will take alot of patience to use as it is the slowest thing i have ever witnessed.

Simply because it has a larger user base on a single OS version. Also the facetime breach was more of a bug, and it was rapidly patched. Android wouldn't get patched so quickly.\n\nOnly thing keeping me to Android is the price for performance, option to interact with my files, and I like the UI of Google Experience more. Performance is unstable, bug amount is higher, and reliability is questionable.\n\nLately I've come to realize that as the tech is advancing so rapidly, there need to be people who take time to make sure it really works properly, and that of course takes time, and in result You get slightly outdated hardware.
