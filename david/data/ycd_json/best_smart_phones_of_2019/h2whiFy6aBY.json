{"cid": "UgwPARkoSCJBjvvanbt4AaABAg", "text": "I'm curious why NO ONE mentions the fact that you can have at least 90% of the Pixel 3 quality with GCam on the POCOPHONE F1. Especially with the last update, you have everything (including the amazing Night Sight), and the buffer issue is completely gone. Really, when you factor that in, what REAL excuse can you find to justify a Pixel 3? We're talking at the very LEAST 2.5 X the price, if not even 3X. You can literally get 3 POCOs for ONE Pixel 3. Oh, and you get a DIRAC, high quality (really AMAZING audio) 3.5 mm headphone jack to boot! An SD card expansion slot too. Oh, a 4000 mAh battery too, compared to 2915 mAh on the Pixel 3. And accurate, INSTANTANEOUS facial recognition, even in pitch black darkness, as compared to no such feature on the Pixel 3. OH, and liquid cooling (it actually DOES work, it's incredible). OHHH, AND 6GB of RAM instead of 4GB on the Pixel 3. AND the ability to unlock your bootloader officially, and put the Pixel 3 software (or Lineage OS or anything you want) on it. So far, the only real plus sides of the Pixel are the special visual core chip (that helps the phone consume less battery when taking pictures), and the OLED screen, as compared to the perfectly good (but IPS LCD screen) on the POCO. This phone was the most hyped up phone of 2018, and for good reason. In my opinion, it wasn't hyped up enough, and people still preferred to go the BRAND way and buy an iPhone, a Pixel, S9, or a Huawei. Which is I guess fine when you can afford it. But what bugs me the most is that people who can't afford the flagships still went on to buy the entry level phones from those brands, which UTTERLY SUCK in comparison to Xiaomi. I mean... picking up a Samsung J6 over a Mi A2 Lite ?! Sometimes I think ignorant consumers deserve what's coming to them.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Cosmin Gurau"}

Pocophone doesn't have glass back and its front screen is cheap to replace. When you drop Poco, chances are, absolutely nothing will happen to it thanks to plastic back. Plastic is really great for durability. You only need glass for the screen and camera so they don't get scratched.\nIf you drop iPhone, prepare 500 bucks. If you drop metal phone, there will be bumps and very visible scratches.\n\nAs for battery or lagging, there's plenty of reviews after months of usage which prove that Pocophone's specs don't drop at all with time.Ôªø", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Progeusz"}

I just received a new one and it's a 128gb model and paid 281 euros. The two combined cost me less than a Samsung note 9 and around the same as a oneplus 6T. That's incredible value really. The camera is actually supposed to be it's weakest component according to many critics. I never agreed and the camera is even better when you port the Google pixelcam apk on to the phone after unlocking the bootloader. It's not pretty. In fact the notch is very ugly but you get over it when you realise the sheer horsepower it possesses. It's incredibly quick and it can support the most demanding games as well with no problems. The sound quality is even great. I'm fascinated to see what they do with the pocophone f2. It's a difficult act to follow.Ôªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Sean Q"}

That's still an amazing cpu. It's not the sd855 but still better than 90 percent of the processors out there. Totally agree. It's a revolutionary phone.

But they did bring up a good point. Most of our photo sharing is on Instagram or Twitter and for a lot of people, just Instgram stories or Snapchat. So as long as out of camera looks good enough, they're happy with it. Which I guess was why HTC was very willing to forego resolution to having better low light performance without hdr or long exposures which works out better for indoors or for parties. But still though, manufacturers still need to keep working on a good enough auto mode that is easy to use and doesn't just do whatever it wants to like enabling portrait bokeh when taking a landscape shot in auto mode stares at NokiaÔªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Zulqarnain Aidil"}

The prophet Isaiah invites those who are hungry and thirsty to ‚Äúcome, buy and eat‚Äù (Isaiah 55:1). But then he asks, ‚ÄúWhy spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?‚Äù (v. 2). Isaiah is talking about more than just physical hunger here.                                              \n\nGod can satisfy our spiritual and emotional hunger through the promise of His presence. The ‚Äúeverlasting covenant‚Äù in verse 3 is a reminder of a promise God made to David in 2 Samuel 7:8‚Äì16. Through David‚Äôs family line, a Savior would come to reconnect people to God. Later, in John 6 : 35 and 7 : 37, Jesus extended the same invitation Isaiah gave, thus identifying Himself as the Savior foretold by Isaiah and other prophets.                   \n\nHungry? Father God invites you to come and be filled in His presence.  Precious one, acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba YHWH (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                                         \nMay God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èÔªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "msdogooder"}

They don‚Äôt take the viewfinder accuracy into consideration, or the characteristic of the stabilization, or the 3D depth layers (for computational bokeh), or the dynamic range into consideration. If they did, iPhone would have the same or better rating as the Huawei phones. \n\nTechnically, the Huawei phones have inferior camera systems in them, but they do offer a 3x telephoto zoom lens.

MKBHD should have included low light shots.\nSo he intentionally or unintentionally made these 3 mistakes and these mistakes brought the wrong results => The wrong results may affect the decisions of smartphone manufacturers and lead them to downgrade the cameras by applying oversharpening, oversaturation and over exposure => In my opinion, if he truly cares a lot about the  smartphone cameras, he should have removed the video so as to not mislead the consumers.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "John P."}

Companies like Samsung and Apple are fully aware that people tend to like bright and colorful pictures.. Even if it's shot on a cheaper phone and camera.. BUT that DOESN'T sell phones to the typical consumer. The TYPICAL consumer looks at the specs on paper. Statistics show that they go for the \"higher numbers\" you can say. THAT is what sells the phones to the majority. The salesman at Bestbuy can say \"well this IPhone camera has this amount of megapixels and the Blackberry ONLY has this.. and that.. and etc...\" and your average consumer (which is the bulk of these companies money) picks what's best on paper.. It's simple marketing.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "King Ulysses"}

But what about GPU? notebookcheck ranks the Apple A12 GPUs above even the Snapdragon 630. And fuck, man I wish Android had monstrous graphics power but it fucking doesn't. We're not gonna pass Apple because they're richer and better at it. But something Apple will never win at is with pricing. You can buy Snapdragon 845 devices for $300-$400. You will never find the $750 XR touch this price as long as its relevant with its A12 bionic.\n\nSo no, specs are not better on Android lol. it's literally out there for you to see, if not on notebookcheck, then geekbench.

Simply put it's not true. Security has little to do with any of it. It all comes down to market share, unique hardware, updating software and user created access.\n\nWhen you want to try to exploit something (unless you're an idiot) you don't choose the OS/Hardware that <10% of the world uses. You go for the one that >80% do. This is the same for phones. Since Mac's have been running the same Intel Chips as PC's, for 10+ years now, they don't have the old advantage they used to. Oh and no the A11/12 chips (in the phones) aren't safe because of this either. They are ARM architecture just like Snapdragons etc. Just look at what happened during the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities debacle last year. So it all comes down to user stupidity and both have plenty. The one leg up you could give Apple is Security patches being pushed. But this isn't on Android either. The Essential/Nexus/Pixel get them just like iPhone, \"insert other Android phone manufacturer here\" just insist on skinning their devices so the updates take a while.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Obsidian"}

The first being 3.5 GHz and the second one being 28 GHz. In order to build 5G network one needs both. 3.5 GHz one is slower but covers much wider range and the 28 GHz one is much faster but covers much shorter range. 3.5 one is built across the nation whereas 28 one is usually built in cities. Now, Huawei is better at 3.5 and that is technologically easier than 28 one. But since Huawei focused on 3.5 one primarily, it has capability of manufacturing. In fact, Samsung has better tech than huawei in 28 one. It's a matter of time before others catch up Huawei in production capability since it's technically easier. In conclusion, you are wrong.
