All I did was remove the underscores to the variables to make them easier to get to instead of the weakly private behavior modifications Python assigns with a single or double-underscored variable.\n\nAs others have said it's not actually \"private\" but as far as I can tell that's the closest you can get to the concept of private from other languages in Python. As far as the getter and setter functions are concerned, I want to say its a way for the developer to control the means by which one changes and accesses the value of these double-underscore, pseudo-private variables. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALZmCy2u0jQÔªø", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "Steven B."}
{"cid": "UgxbJ5GmqQZ_ItDGxvp4AaABAg.8gnjs0cpQNE8k7PMCJc5fj", "text": "As I can gather, Python does not technically have access modifiers but you can add a type of scope by convention and refer base classes. I struggled with this example as well but realised that the double underscore refers to private and are unable to refer by subclass. If you add a single underscore it emulates a scope of protected and will be able to access the base class properties. \n\nSo my properties are defined as:\n   _name = \"\"\n   _height = 0\n   _weight = 0\n   _sound = \"\"\n\nand the dog class method for toString:\ndef toString(self):\n      return \"Name: {}, height is {}, weight is {} and the sound is {} and the owner is {}\".format(self._name, self._height, self._weight, self._sound, self.__owner) <-- double underscore on owner in the Dog class, so would not be able to inherit the value for further child classes, so I am saying that dog can only inherit from Animal and not filter down.\n\nthis worked perfectly. \n\nAs with the comment that Derek's video is teaching you all wrong because Python does not have access modifiers, which is technically true, Derek is a Jack of all trades educator and from my personal experience of more strictly typed languages for me C#, python gives you access modifiers by convention in the case you come from one of these languages to make the transition easier and by design Python seems to more or less emulate OOP fairly accurately. So to say Derek is showing you Java python, is in my opinion not necessarily true. If that was the case Python would not allow you to create classes and add the ability of inheritance and polymorphism. OOP design is oop design regardless of language. The reason I believe that python might be a bit tricky with these methodologies is because it is such a syntactically free language and is extremely adaptable.Ôªø", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Mitch Tame"}

Take that with a grain of salt though. Thinking of a video game character also helps you imagine it. The character would be your class.

If you a.e. have code you want to collapse into a single line and this one line gets so long that it doesn't fit on the monitor anymore, in c# you can spread this single line over multiple lines and still have a obvious end with the semicolon. Idk how this works out in Python after a while, i have a hard time believing it won't get a bit messy. I think it's easyer to read but it comes down to personal preference at the end, i guess.\nFurther, i like clearly declared variables. Performance is another thing.

But for me, it makes it much faster to read code and less cognitive effort to find the end of one line of code that spans multiple lines.  For Python, you have to have a concatenation operator in order to break one line into multiple lines.  If i remember correctly, their multi-line concatenation operator is the double-backslash.\n\nbraces { } for code blocks\nSame deal here too:  Easier to read and less cognitive effort.  I swear all these trendy hipsters who like Python... it fucking seems like they NEVER have to go back and READ CODE.  Eh, I take that back... I remember programming in QBasic... your brain will eventually adjust... it just seems like it'd be much slower to read without the the braces & semi-colons JUMPING OUT AT YOU.  And by slower, yes, I'm sure we're talking about a difference of milliseconds... but still, seems significant to me (when you add it up. lol).\n\nmaps & lists\nFirst, Python is very inconsistent between maps & lists.  For maps, you use a keyword to act on the object in order to delete an entry.  For lists, you use a method of the object to remove an entry.  Why the inconsistency ?\n\nself\nWhile we're on the subject of methods... That reminds me:  Why the need for self EVERYWHERE ?  Why do you have to put self in every method declaration ?  I mean, to put this question in perspective, remember that on a language scale from concise-to-verbose, it seems like in every decision that Python has made... it has made the choice TO BE MORE CONCISE... except when it comes to method declarations ?\n\nI mean sure, under the hood, this is just how it works: It's an implementation detail... and one that most other object-oriented languages don't worry the programmer with.\n\nmaps & lists\nBack to maps & lists...  Using symbols to create these new objects is a nice convenience for experts, but I believe it's doing a disservice to beginners who are learning object-oriented programming.  One of the best ways to learn object-oriented programming is by using well designed objects over & over again... until it \"clicks\" for you... and you \"get it.\"  And some of the best designed objects we have in C++/C#/Java are the Collection classes.  A beginner can easily use these Collection classes... and start to understand how to design their own classes.\n\ntype system\nFurthermore, the problem with Python maps & lists is that there is no separation between interface & implementation.  So, that's a huge problem.  First, students aren't learning polymorphism.  That, for example, they have ask for a List in a functions, method, or constructor... then pass in any implementation later (Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList).\n\nBut that's a huge problem because in Python, there are no types in your functions, methods, & constructors.  So what is preventing you from passing in ANY OBJECT that happens to crash the whole system and your business loses money and/or clients/customers because of it.\n\nI don't think a lot of Python programmers understand the power of a compiler:  To be able to catch errors at compile-time is a beautiful thing.  For a static-type system, wiring objects together is like playing with legos ... because the compiler enforces which legos can fit together, and which legos cannot... Or, in this case, objects.\n\ncsv\nI also spotted some inconsistencies where arguments are sometimes separated by a space and other times, they are separated by a comma.  THIS IS BONKERS.  Most languages have stated goals to read like prose (as much as possible).  And in prose, we separate items with commas, NOT spaces.\n\nlanguage design\nFor language designers, they have to strike a delicate balance between being concise(& faster to type) and being verbose(& faster to read).  Me personally, having to read other people's code, I prefer verbosity.  Even with Java being pretty verbose, I frequently find bugs where the intention of the code is unclear.  Did the programmer want THIS behavior ?  Or THAT behavior ?  ...probably something that can only be answered by the original programmer (if available) or the program specification (if available).  I can only imagine how much worse this would be in Python.\n\nEven tho it seems like I've written a lot here, I could actually go on & on forever about Python & real-life arguments I've had with Python programmers... wanting to dump anything into a collection... that should be organized for retrievals... and telling me SPI META-INF/services/ was impossible !

To delete an entry in a list you simply use del mylist[x]. Objects can be deleted the same way but are deleted when you have no reference to them. No garbage collection to worry about. Don't know in which languages you have to deal with that but it's a pain. Python is simple. Which makes it great when you want to dive into the programming without having to worry about technical details. You can quickly build a prototype.

I explained very clearly WHY Python is horrible for beginners.\n\nFirst, it uses symbols for some Collection objects, which while it's a nice convenience for experts, it inconsistent & wrong.  Wrong because in a good standard library like in C++/C#/Java, the standard library will give beginners a wide array of EXAMPLES of well designed objects.  By using these well designed classes & objects, it'll help them learn object-oriented programming.\n\nSecond, there's no view, no virtual, no interface, no abstract class... there's not even a type system.  So you cannot separate interface from implementation.  In such an environment, how can a beginner possible learn polymorphism ?\n\nPssh, let's not worry ourselves with technical details like good object-oriented programming & polymorphism.\n\nTo answer your other question, a Map is a Collection of key-value pairs.  Also known as a Dictionary.\n11:30 del grocery_list[4]\nvs\n11:30 grocery_list.*remove*(\"Pickle\")\n14:21 del super_villians['Fiddler']\n\nThis is a glaring inconsistency where on one-hand, Python is using a keyword to act upon the internal state of an object... and on the other hand, Python is using a method to change the internal state of an object.\n\nDid you read anything I wrote ?  Or where you just too quick to defend MAH favorite language in a thread designed to criticize it ?\n\nListen, criticism is good.  I criticize my favorite languages too, so don't get offended.  But the topic here is Python.  The OP pointed some things that I agreed with (braces & semi-colons).  I merely added to his list:  Namely, that Python is horrible for beginners.  Really, ANY dynamically typed language is horrible for beginners.  ANY statically typed language is much better for beginners because they will be given immediate feedback of errors from the compiler.  Plus, with the type system, they will be able to learn more advanced concept like polymorphism... And separation between interface & implementation, which doesn't even make sense in a Python-like environment.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Nikolai Kalashnikov"}

Just because you typed something doesn't make you a god that can't be questioned. I understand that you meant dictionaries. Thought it would be a good idea for you to explain it yourself. Map is a common term but in Python it's dictionary. Guess you could also call it associative array if you want. You seem focused on object orientation. I see that as a subject of its own and not necessary for small projects. Object orientation can give you head ache when you start thinking about philosophical questions like what a shape is, what should inherit a shape and what has a shape. Learning to write good classes takes a long time. Instead of logic you will spend much time with loose coupling and patterns. Beginners should learn to write algorithms and understand logic. When they have the pieces they can stuff it into a class. Then we suddenly have objects that need to work together. Abtraction is moved to a higher level. Which means new challenges. But I guess we have different views on what programming is. To me it isn't even about computers but a way of thinking and solving problems.\n\nYes it's a good idea to have a strongly typed language. PHP doesn't have it. Not javascript or Python. Actionscript on the other hand, C#, C++ and Java are strongly typed. I've used all of them and never had any problem. Confusing at first but you get used to it. If I started using PHP again I would forget those annoying dollar signs.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Jerry Perry"}

That's why I like to think in terms of lego blocks:  And simply ASK for what you need in the constructor & method signature.  I also like to ask the question:  \"How can I make my objects intuitive & easy to use ?\"\n\nBut as you've pointed out, OOP is not a solution for everything... despite what the OOP \"experts\" would have us believe.  I haven't personally hit the limitations of OOP... but I've read some articles.  Two examples stand out the most.\n\nFirst example would be when Netflix refactored their codebase using their functional reactive model... they were seeing over 20 network calls per user operation... and with a functional model, they were able to make drastic improvements (i think one or two network calls if i remember correctly).\n\nSecond example would be some guy who wrote chess games... He explains how cringe-worthy this job interview question is:  \"Model a chess game using OOP.\"  He explains the actual inter-workings of a computer chess game... How a Tree data structure is used to determine moves... and how OOP utterly FAILS in this situation because of the amount of memory that the objects would take up... Versus, how it's actually done... which I don't remember exactly... but it's basically low-level optimizations using bits to reduce the amount of memory that's used.\n\nBut yeah, I'm not God.

Kivy specializes in app develop for multi-touch devices, like your smartphones and tablets. \n\nBEFORE using any framework, module, or library, make sure you learn the programming basics first. \n\n  - Variables\n  - How important list, tuple and dictionary types are in, data management.\n  - If statements\n  - Loop statements\n  - Functions\n  - Classes\n  - Inheritance\n  - File I/O \n\nThat should be a good start.

{"cid": "UgxB33E_UyHQp8f73qN4AaABAg", "text": "Warning! This tutorial is not a good Python tutorial. It is clearly written by someone who comes from a Java/C++ background, and misuses Python constructs that they confuse for constructs from those languages. For example, it uses double-underscore name-mangling, i.e. things like  `self.__myvar = myvar` , but this is *not meant to be used like a private access modifier*. You just do `self.myvar = myvar` in Python, or, if you want to signal to people that an attribute is an implementation detail, you use a *single underscore*. Second, the tutorial creates a bunch of class variables, that are immediately shadowed by instance variables in the initializer. This is totally pointless, and can lead to subtle bugs. Finally, a `toString` method?  Use `__str__` in Python, and then you can just `print(instance)` or `str(instance)`. Again, clearly someone is coming from Java or C++.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Juan Arrivillaga"}

This really showed me all I needed to know to get started. Aim is to start building Alexa skills and working (with others) to build real world solutions for people using AI, Avatars and voice activated services. OK I need lots of input from other people and have made some of those connection, but I also want to have the basic ideas on how things happen, and build a few things myself, though I probably won't be commercially efficient as a developer. Anyway this was good - and I am taking some of your other tutorials also. What is good is that with very little time commitment, I got a good understanding of all I need to start.

You need to learn to programming in general, to think like a programmer, to get a sense of what your mindset needs to be when facing programming problems. And to do this, you need to start out with a simple language that doesn't frustrate you with complex things like type declaration, memory allocation,etc. (witch you'll then have to then learn, obviously).\nThat's what python is for (partially), to have a simple language that you can use as a tool to get into the mindset of a programmer, to then advance to more complex languages like Java and C++, in witch all you'll have to do is use the same techinques you already learned, but with more language-bound complications that you'll have to get used to (witch is, believe it or not, the easier part).Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Tomas Canevaro"}

A set is made up of games.\n\nTo win a set, a player has to win 6 games with a difference of 2 games.  At 6-6, there is often a special tie-breaker.  In some cases, players go on playing till one of them wins the set with a difference of two games.\n\nTennis matches can be either 3 sets or 5 sets.  The player who wins a majority of sets wins the match (i.e., 2 out 3 sets or 3 out of 5 sets)\nThe score of a match lists out the games in each set, with the overall winner's score reported first for each set.  Thus, if the score is 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 it means that the first player won the first set by 6 games to 3, lost the second one 5 games to 7 and won the third one 7 games to 6 (and hence won the overall match as well by 2 sets to 1).\n\nYou will read input from the keyboard (standard input) containing the results of several tennis matches.  Each match's score is recorded on a separate line with the following format:\n\nWinner:Loser:Set-1-score,...,Set-k-score, where 2 <= k <= 5\n\nFor example, an input line of the form\n\nWilliams:Muguruza:3-6,6-3,6-3\n\nindicates that Williams beat Muguruza 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a best of 3 set match.\n\nThe input is terminated by a blank line.\n\nYou have to write a Python program that reads information about all the matches and compile the following statistics for each player:\n\nNumber of best-of-5 set matches won\nNumber of best-of-3 set matches won\nNumber of sets won\nNumber of games won\nNumber of sets lost\nNumber of games lost\n\nYou should print out to the screen (standard output) a summary in decreasing order of ranking, where the ranking is according to the criteria 1-6 in that order (compare item 1, if equal compare item 2, if equal compare item 3 etc, noting that for items 5 and 6 the comparison is reversed).\n\nFor instance, given the following data\n\nDjokovic:Murray:2-6,6-7,7-6,6-3,6-1\nMurray:Djokovic:6-3,4-6,6-4,6-3\nDjokovic:Murray:6-0,7-6,6-7,6-3\nMurray:Djokovic:6-4,6-4\nDjokovic:Murray:2-6,6-2,6-0\nMurray:Djokovic:6-3,4-6,6-3,6-4\nDjokovic:Murray:7-6,4-6,7-6,2-6,6-2\nMurray:Djokovic:7-5,7-5\nWilliams:Muguruza:3-6,6-3,6-3\n\nyour program should print out the following\n\nDjokovic 3 1 13 142 16 143\nMurray 2 2 16 143 13 142\nWilliams 0 1 2 15 1 12\nMuguruza 0 0 1 12 2 15\n\nYou can assume that there are no spaces around the punctuation marks \":\", \"-\" and \",\".  Each player's name will be spelled consistently and no two players have the same name.\n\nanyone can solve thisÔªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Sumamt Sharma"}

My guess is that even though we're inheriting from Animal class, we still can't access the private variables directly from the Dog class.\n\nIf you look at the cheat sheet in the video description, you'll see Derek also uses getter methods within the Dog toString method - for some reason he hasn't shown this in the video, but that's how to get around that problemÔªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lawr Leaf"}

Just change \"5/2\" into \"5.0/2\"\n\n5 is an integer value, 5.0 is a floating point one ( I suggest that you should learn basics of how numbers are coded in a computer if you haven't already). When you ask Python 2 to divide an integer by an integer he thinks that you ask for another integer and drops off the remainder. If you want a float than you should divide a float by a float (5.0 / 2.0). If you divide one type by another (5.0 / 2 or 5/2.0) then Python will transform both variables to one type that has the most precision of the two (in this case both values will become floats, i.e. 5.0 and 2.0).\n\ntruncating integer division is  rather common - C/C++ does that two (last time I checked). Expecting a floating point number from integer division is so common that modern languages start implementing int. Beside Python 3, for example, Haskell too gives 2.5 for 5/2. But I like older languages' behavior because it makes you think what happens under the hood. Modern languages try to make computer guess human logic, but there will always be surprises if you have no idea how numbers are handled.

I feel like this will stop me from solving problems myself and am not sure what I should do. Others online have pointed to reading others code to progress and get better at python however it seems like a huge step from what I know how to do and understanding how programs work without seeing the entire picture makes things even more challenging.

{"cid": "Ugh_cEdSjFFogHgCoAEC", "text": "7:15 print(\"%s %s %s\" %('quote', quote, multi )) This syntax is different than most languages where function & method arguments are comma separated. I wonder if the function declaration for print() is only accepting one parameter, then parsing it ? Because of the weird syntax with %() being passed in. Most languages would accept an array and the syntax would be print(\"%s %s %s\", 'quote', quote, multi)... Yeah, looking at the source code, it looks like there can only be one comma that does separation of args & kwargs (keyword_args like sep, file & end as shown in 7:50). Based off the function declaration, i'm guessing that if you wanted to use all 3 keywords sep, file, & end, i'm guessing that they'd be separated by spaces ?\n\n8:58 print('First Item', grocery_list[0]) Okay, now I'm confused ? Maybe I was looking at the source code for a different version of Python than the one you're using ? No string concatenation here. Just a list of parameters ? I see now that your IDE says the print declaration is an array of objects.\n\n11:30 del grocery_list[4] VERSE grocery_list.remove(\"Pickle\") \n14:43 del super_villians['Fiddler']\n14:21 super_villians = {\"Fiddler\" : \"Issac Bowin\"}\n14:59 super_villians['Pied Piper'] = 'Hartley Rathaway'\n\nPython seems schizophrenic: Sometimes it's using the methods of an object (the object oriented approach) and other times it's using an outside function or keyword to act on an object. Sure, it's perfectly fine to use a function to act on an object sometimes. But I'm not sure I can agree that this is a good beginner language because of the inconsistencies, and the use of symbols to represent real objects. Symbols are nice shortcuts for experienced programmers, but i believe they're doing a dis-service to people learning OOP.  If someone doesn't understand object-oriented programming, then i would recommend Java or C# because they have so many objects to use... And after a while of using well designed objects (like Collections, List, Set, Map), OO will start to \"click\" and you'll \"get it.\"\n\nCompare the above python to java:\nMap<String, String> super_villians = new HashMap<String, String>();\nsuper_villians.put(\"Fiddler\", \"Issac Bowin\");\nsuper_villians.remove(\"Fiddler\");\nsuper_villians.put(\"Pied Piper\", \"Thomas Peterson\");\nsuper_villians.put(\"Pied Piper\", \"Hartley Rathaway\");\nsuper_villians.size()\n\n17:38 The logical operators and, or,  not: This is a cool language feature to have these as keywords instead of symbols.\n\n20:02 for x in range(0, 10)\nI didn't see an example of a backwards for-loop, but stackoverflow has several different ways.\n\n33:22 def set_name(self, name):\nself is an interesting concept, but it's totally un-necessary to implement a language in this way. Also, i noticed that even tho methods declare self as a parameter, that you're not required to pass it as an argument (i'm guessing it gets passed automatically).\n\n40:49\nWhat about:\ndef play_sound(self):\n    play_sound(self, 1)\n\ndef play_sound(self, how_many):\n    print(self.get_sound() * how_many)\n\n41:43 def get_type(self, animal)\n\"And it is going to receive Animal objects.\"\nHow does it only take animal objects ? No type is specified. Couldn't you pass it any object that had a method get_type() ?\n\nin a strongly typed language, it's easy to see what type of objects are passed into functions & methods (the types are part of the method declaration). I'm struggling to see how you know what type of object to pass into a method without looking at the implementation details ?\n\n42:22\ntest_animals = AnimalTesting()\nThere's no view ? No virtual ?
