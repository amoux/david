{"cid": "UgxiplNH0huUWzNAzd14AaABAg", "text": "I'm pretty green when it comes to programming.  I started taking java lessons on codecademy last week, however, someone recommended I learn Python instead.  This is my first Python lesson and it is very easy to catch on to based on your proper instructions.  I have a question after watching this lesson.  It seems that with Java you learn the vocabulary, learn the syntax, write code.. whereas it seems with Python you Create the vocabulary, learn the syntax, write code.  Is this correct and does this mean that all Python programmers use custom variables of their choice?  \n\nI do have one more question.  In your video, you demonstrate swapping values with variables and how some variables that are assigned to other variables remain with the same value from earlier coding despite changes in later coding.  Some change.  My question is, if it is possible to swap values when it comes to variables, can I have two identical lines of code written in two different points of my script that will produce different results?﻿", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Phareke"}

However HTML is very easy to unde3rstand the concept and formation, however I'm assuming it can get nuts. Seems you know all kinds and have great knowledge on programming. Maybe a series on doing specific things advanced (a litle more) like putting forums on a webpage, or making a game that rolla dice. Making 21/Black jack couldn't be to confusing at all.\n\nIf I wanted to give values to 150 variables, i could use 2 and 3 as variables and 23? also A,B and AB as variables???\n\nThen if I wanted to assign the value as each 150 original pokemon, would it be a string thats just >>>A=('Bulbasour')  ???? \ncould I do also do >>>A=1   also just closed my python are the spaces I know space make a difference in some cases but dont remember.\n\n\n\nAlso adding an image to A how would that be done???  \n\nand eventually put in a random number generator and generate one of the original 150 pokemon- thats what I want to do as my first program thats unique to my self not copying someones through a tutorial, although I will be doing many prior.

Even though the value of variable a is changed later on, variable f still has a value of 1 because \"a = 1\" came before it.\n\nIf you wanted it to print out \"2\", then the code would look like this:\na = 1\nf = a\na = 2\nf = a\nprint(f)\n\nIn this case, the variable f is assigned the value of 2, so 2 is now printed. Notice how I added the line \"f = a\" after \"a = 2\". You have to do this because even though the value of variable a changed, the value of variable f is still assigned the old value of variable a, so we have to \"update\" variable f so that it is now assigned the new value of variable a.\n\nHope this helped.﻿", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "MasterrrSword"}
