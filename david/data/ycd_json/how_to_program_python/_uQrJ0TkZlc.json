Thus I believed that python would manage not to kill itself from memory overload, and as far as I can see from `top` in bash, memory is not flooded, but I can be misinterpreting what I see - and the most likely explanation, I think, is that I don't manage the memory properly.\n\nEvery example I can find with memory management uses the `Process` functionality instead, and from the examples andxproblems of others that I can find on the web, Process would in my case not be ideal to use: subset analysis function will be called upon approximately 1.5 million times.\n\nOf course, I could restructure somehow, for example I already thought about getting rid of the second input argument by getting doing each of the 4 analyses after one another, inside the analysis function. Its output could simply be reshaped, so that would work; but that still wouldn't get around my problem, if the problem is memory.\n\nThanks for reading by!﻿", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "inrevenant"}

Software, and more specifically programing, has always been my downfall. In addition to python, I'm also very interested in shell scripting and have been trying to learn that as well, mainly to automate things on my unraid server. \n\nYour lesson has been so helpful and I've never felt as confident as I do while learning from you.

We are a company that has a development language that is not open source (it is proprietary).  The licensing is nuts for the clients.  We have around 24,000 source programs that need to be rewritten.  We wrote a few of the modules in PHP and I was not impressed with PHP.   Our system is extremely I/O intensive and that does not seem to be in PHP’s wheelhouse.  Python seems, at this point, to be able to handle that well. However, I like loading database tables into memory using, as much as possible, 3 dimensional arrays.  This style significantly reduces disk I/O however the trade off is actual memory.  So, my goal is to rewrite the significant pieces in Python.    Great videos by the way.  Thank you for having them.

The explanation's are so shallow, there's no activities to make you think for yourself (it's just repeat after me, minimal retention stuff) and there's many discrepancies between Mac/windows/linux users that Mosh either doesn't pick up on or can't be bothered to mention. There's also no troubleshooting or comments section like on this YouTube video to help with specific problems you will come across or discussion board for people having the same issue. Sure you can google it but it would be nice to have a common problems section on each lesson, with such a new subject it's hard to even know what to google and i found several times i'd spend hours trying to fix what turned out to be a simple enough problem. I think Mosh needs to go back over his paid content, fix discrepancies and include some support section rather than churning out more inferior quality paid content.

In that spirit, I'd like to share something I just discovered with anyone else who might be interested. At 3:29:00, at the end of \"Modules\", you explain how to use the Python built-in \"max\" function to \"print(max(numbers))\". So I tried the same thing with the \"find_max\" function you created in your end-of-lesson exercise and I was pleased to find that the same single line of code \"print(find_max(numbers))\" also returns the highest number in the list, without the need to define the variable \"maximum\" in the previous line of code (allowing that line to be deleted). 👍 Anyway, thanks again for the great tutorial, I'm looking forward to the next 2hrs45! 😃﻿", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "TheBlade996"}

My background is in biology and social studies, so computers and I don't always get along.  I know practically nothing about hardware.  So I'm many steps lower than even an absolute beginner when it comes to modern programming languages.  It never fails that whenever the book or video you have was made the information in it for installing what you need to install to use a given language is out of date.  So, when a book or video tells the user to go to a website and download something to get started, some effort should be made to explain what specific files are needed.  When I went to python.org it was mere chance that I managed to download what I need for my particular computer and operating system.﻿", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Christian Patriot"}

I'd follow along in my editor, but it really wasn't necessary, as none of the problems he tackled were difficult (not that these are super difficult for someone above novice level, but I found the challenge here to be much better). \n\nThere are other courses there that may be better, and for more advanced stuff, I'm sure there's some meat to be found, but that course was not great.﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Patrick Enright"}

{"cid": "Ugynw-py__wbahIMq5d4AaABAg", "text": "The only reason I want to learn pytnon is because it is a very very great start for beginners. It's easy and straight forward. Much much less complicated than JavaScript that all these tuturials and developers keep recommending for us beginners. I've been working on JavaScript for the last two years and man it's freaking hard. I've gotten better at it, but I still see that python is the way to go for me. Again, very straight forward. This is one side. The other side is that I was born and raised in a very broken country. We didn't enjoy any of the technologies that are available in this world. I lived in a city of 55 thousand people and only one person in that whole city had a computer. He was a friend of mine. Every time I went to his house I'd sigh a lot wishing that I had the same. I have loved computers the second I saw them. I wanted to learn how to speak to them in their own languages. I can sit in front of my laptop for hours and never get bored nor tired of it. I just enjoy programming so much that I'd start shaking when I think about the future developer I will become. The best thing to isolate myself from our world's problems is to code. Thank you for your amazing tutorial(s). I've learned a lot from you. You and other good developers like you here on YouTube are making my dream come true.

{"cid": "UgwpgggZlLJ-pL4ue4p4AaABAg", "text": "What would I like to do with Python? Tons of things. I would like to create my start-up or close to educational unit where children would learn real world programming since sper young age, so coding/programming would be there \"native\" tounge. I would add there plenty of emotional education, enterprenurial mindsets that teach them how to sustain motivation over the long term. SO they would be exiceted about how they can solve real world problems and help people around, improve pepole's lives, by codiing and automatization. Since I am big fan of both Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla) and DeepMind in the same time. I would like to merge missions of the two. Working title is \"Einstein Crew\" - which is self learning algorithms taught how to create in any area (Mars or other planets) completly on their own with tools they have - oxygen, food, shelter, energy. Instead of risking lives of people you send robots that provide running base with all the necceseary to survival for human beings conditions. Prepare as well landing zone, and signal emiters in order to let people land safaely and in controlled way. You send something like \"lego blocks\" with algorithms taught how to process resources or use \"lego blocks\" and they build all that is neccesary for human survival. As those are robots they can be sent even to Alpha Centauri to explore and start explore and prepare conditions for humans there as well. As those are robots, no need to worry about hibernation, exposure to radiation unless it hurts the TPU's and GPU's or any integral part of their architecture.\nOther thing I would like to create is learning relation between signals (infra - red, video input, sound) for drones. Can algorithm learn just by randomly exploring the space and collecting sounds learn to understand human speech? So by no prior knowledge if human tells him \"go left\" and show him the direction with his hand(video-sound relation) dorne will fly left? Moreover - drone is rewarded for emiting sounds similiar to what he collects as inputs. Can he emulate human speech and use it for his communication? One dorne definietely would not be enough. Let's say it's 100 drones collecting the signals every day - then return the inputs for analysis to reinforcment neural nets. Algorithm is updated drones fly and collect once again. With that experiment there is another nice feature. \nEnergy needed to fly the drone. Drone controls his energy level in his batteries, automatically goes to \"charge mode\" if he considers he will run low on eergy f.e. below 30%. Drones can as well be covered with solar panels (there are felxible solars based on crystals Peroskvites) he can look for places where the sun exposure is the strongest - therefore energy production and charging. SO he can become pretty much self sustainable in terms of energy.\nAnother thing - can you fully automatize energy production. From mining Silicon - producing silicon wafers, adding Borium and Phosporus, creating wiring and collecting final production. Fully automatized production including making orders for materials.\nThat's my python motivation.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Paweł Hajdecki"}

I want to be able to use my smartphone, and fill out a form that will then store the bin-move or bin-fill in such a way that I can immediately search for key-words to find the items or any other items, and also such the office can see ONLY those items that I moved. They don't use excel, but I could probably use excel  for android, (their database, I don't know what it is and it is a dos-looking program, but it's probably very easy to export to excel docs) , search excel to find items, and then have a small app that both creates a new doc for my daily moves, and also updates my full inventory doc, and I have a web-domain that I can use to host it for personal use. (because it's just for me to learn with!! ) ,,, anyway, I'm not ready, I don't know how to use SQL, which westhost has on my server, and I can barely use html, and don't know how to run python from the web-server...... but I have nothing but time!!!

So I added CSS to my learning. So I would say I know these two languages pretty well. But you know, in every language you have still something  to learn.
