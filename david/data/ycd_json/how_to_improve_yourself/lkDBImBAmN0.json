{"cid": "Ugykt3u6kxxlbA5y4cN4AaABAg", "text": "Did anyone told you that School was literally USELESS? Team fearless, I know that we have to live our life, I know that we have to truely live every second. But, school is just here to waste your time, You can't get out because you have homeworks, you have to waste a whole year because you have official exams to pass, you have to waste 7 hours a day learning things that will NEVER help you in this life! b^2-4ac, IN WHAT THIS FORMULA HERE WILL HELP ME IN MY FUTURE?! How can I live life if Parents won't let you get out of house because \"you have to study\". I'VE SPENT 16 YEARS TO SCHOOL AND WHAT DID I HAVE?! What? Answer this question here, what did I have..? A diploma? A diploma.. Heh.. This is laughable, tell me why most of the successful people YOU HAVE MENTIONNED in this video, are dropouts, why only dropouts are successful, oh wait a second, because they knew that they had to get out of that road, what kind of road? That road where everyone is walking on, EVERYONE!!! We are living a LIE god damn it!!! That road tells us to: Go to school, go to the university, find a job that you DO NOT like just for MONEY and WORK FOR SOMEBODY (you'll be an employee in most of the cases), have a familly, and die. Is that life? Is that life?! NO AND NO this is a life of someone who is living a LIE, for the familly, in most of the cases, THERE IS PROBLEMS, THERE IS PROBLEMS, why only few people are living happily with their familly and the rest are having problems? Why..? Because they do not understand? No, because they haven't be taught how to be happy, they haven't be taught how to choose your partner, they haven't been taught all of this.. What they have been taught you say? They have been taught how to do maths, they have been taught that \"having problems in a relation ship is normal\", they have been taught to do anything for money, and not for themselves, they have been taught BULLSHIT! \n\nI have a goal in life, but too bad I have to wait until I pass those exams I have, to be free. \nThat goal, is to awake people, to tell them that they are living a lie, that they have to be themselves but not to be who they think they are, I have to tell them that if they truely love themselves, they would work on themselves: If you were obese, you would work on yourself because you truely love yourself and you don't want to die because of obesity (that's an example), if you want to have Randy Orton's body, you would WORK to have it, you would GO to the gym! I personally do go to the gym, it's been 3 weeks now, thank god my parents agreed and didn't told me to stay at home because I have exams to pass or homeworks to do. Now, how would I make this happen? How can I achieve my goal? I have a plan, I already have a plan, guys, I'm 17 years old and I clearly know what to do in life, and how to do it, I want to be a movie producer and make movies about those lies we're living  I want to make interviews, I want to talk about that on TV, on the media, SHARE IT EVERYWHERE!!! I do make montage, I do graphic designs on Blender, I want to share it at any cost. \n\nAs for love, I'm not going to search for it, no. I'm instead going to wait, until I find that this person fits with me, love isn't only by \"seeing\" someone, or \"looking\" at someone, love comes after friendship, you have to live things with that friend, you have to know how this person thinks, now, of course, not everyone can have the same thought, if you were about to argue to see who the heck is right about something, it means that you don't love the person that is right in front of you, because, who cares about who is right or who is wrong? Now there's limits, of course (am I getting off topic lmao?) if you love someone that says: killing is good, you should do something, of course (I'll just ask how you could love someone that loves killing lol, but idc love is love üòâ).\n\nJust wanted to point that out.. School is useless, it teaches you: you failed a test, you're a failure. It does not teaches you: You failed a test, you will do better next time. Nah hell no they aren't teaching you that (now there's billions of school out there, and I'm sure there's great ones that has a good system, like FINLAND school system or Khan Akademy).\n\n\"I'll not say that life isn't fair, because we haven't truely living it yet\"- S Shadow. \n\nThere, I made a quote. :)Ôªø", "time": "21 hours ago (edited)", "author": "S Shadow"}

I was trying best for thinking in which way I would do it. Don't look up my age, there maybe not tomorrow so I was the trying from before. I always used to look videos how earth is getting damaged but never looked how earth is being saved. I have watched the video maybe some days ago. In 3 minutes of videos we were 10 million years after from now. And the sun was a black dwarf and earth was nothing. I wasn't able to sleep at night. It may sound like story but it's true. But due to some kind of positivity inside I got my hopes up like what will happen when their will be no life in this universe = universe will form more happy life than our human's once. I am not saying all the thing here talked were wrong but only getting the dream isn't enough that dream should give you positive vibes than tensions. I hope it helped you!üòáÔªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Apekshya Dhakal"}

The only thing why I keeo on playing the sport I don't want is for scholarship on a university. I couldn't stop playing cuz I need scholarship on a really famous university for a brighter future. Better job. Cuz here in the Philippines , they base your intelligence and discipline to your academical status. The better your school is, the smarter you are. Well that's a bit true. Knowledge has a price. I've been on a different kind of schools so it is really much better if you study in a university. Because someday, your boss will look at your academical status and base if they're gonna hire you or not through it. Anyway I wanted to play soccer instead of chess but I'm 13 already and I don't even know how to play it. I can't tell my parents what I want cuz they will spend a lot of money there but we don't have money (we're not rich). I really want to transfer to another school right away cuz i dont like my school they don't know how to teach a student. So help me what should i do i need scholarship but i must play chess but i want to olay soccer instead of chess but i can't play soccer cuz i wont be able to have a scholarship and we dont have any money so please.

On the contrary, i failed because i was doubting myself, on my capability so i start to believe on my luck. People around me laugh at my failure, I was the person who was topper at one time and as i failed i came on the piece of a joke. It hurts, it makes me cry. But, the good things is that it gave me more courage to get back again and i have decide to give exam on Sunday next week. Like before, i have not trust on luck or supernatural power , now i believe on myself because i know my fault and i also know i will raise high. Last failure was a lesson for me that we should never stop believing on ourselves. Hard-work is more, consistency is more, dedication is more, i don't hope to go well instead i believe that i will give my best and make it my best exam ever.Ôªø", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "arni zona"}

It is a common man understand the situation and try to balance the life while a successful person forget everything , like there personal life their family and all and only focuses on success . Actually in my perspective maintaining  a normal life is success . So you can't say a common man is a failure in respect of successful people.

Let's debunk every part of this incredibly ignorant comment so this self-entitled person actually tries and inform themselves (maybe YOU need to spend a little more time on the internet doing some actual reading), hold on tight cause it's a long one:\n\n1. Millennails are lazt af.\nOh really, funny how millennials show A LOT HIGHER graduation rates from high school, and even more college enrollment than non-millennial generations. I don't know what your definition of lazy is, but in my world working hard to be a professional in something is the opposite of being lazy. Sorry we aren't a bunch of dropouts who decided living a mediocre life was enough (yeah I'm talking to you \"millennials lack purpose\" guy). I'm just shoving these facts here since you didn't really say why are we lazy exactly. Is it cause we spend time on the internet? honey, we were born in a technological era, thanks to technology we actually do have more dreams and high goals,  besides, didn't yall spend all your time listening to the radio or watching tv all day? \n\n2. That last point in 1 actually brings me to this one, what exactly do you call being in \"reality\" lmfao. Last time I checked we millennials have to deal with the fucking mess your generations made. It so much more expensive to live, to buy a house, to be economically stable.. etc. We spend time on the  internet because times have evolved, should we just sit on our asses all day playing yaxes then? And actually, news and information are SO accessible and fast-traveling thanks to the internet, we GET a picture of reality, trust me, we just don't have to wait a week till it's printed on a newspaper.  We end up making wrong decisions? is that a millennial thing really? here was I thinking that that's how a human learns and gains experience. (btw didn't your generations feel the need to spend millions on armies and guns instead of focusing on education, health and stability?)\n\n3. \"Knowing reality\" is something a human being in this society learns from experience, times have changed and yeah we didn't grow up like you did, that doesn't mean we lack sensibility, actually, I think millennials are the most hopeful,  humanitarian and socially aware generation thanks to the atrocities your generation did, thank you for showing us how it ISN'T done. The struggles we encounter as adults are not because we're lazy, it's cause of the world that was inherited to us and the systems that were taught to us that are obsolete and failed to adapt to a fast developing society, the education system is a perfect example, are you really blaming us for being shoved into these systems that don't fit us anymore? \n\nThey say that knowledge is freedom, the more you learn, the  better version of yourself you are, so  yes, it is about books and not just books, but videos, blogs, articles, etc that are available to us with a click.\n\nP.S I'm aware past generations did inherit us all these tools we can develop ourselves with, I'm just stating that ya'll created these tools and for some reason don't expect us to use them or adapt to them. We millennials are hopeful and full of creativity, you know what really gets in our way? idiots encasing us in a box with set characteristics because they are too narrow minded to actually inform themselves, you know, like the ones who think they know about you more than you know about yourself.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Marisol Zeled√≥n"}

I'm pushing my body to it's limit, and spending hours in practice. It's painful. But I enjoy the pain. No pain, no gain,eh?

{"cid": "Ugg0fFgYtstte3gCoAEC", "text": "As much as I agree with this video's motives, sometimes you need to relax, you NEED to \"waste\" time or you will burn out. You say that you need to do things you enjoy, but imply that playing video games or spending time with friends is a waste? Surely if you enjoy something, you are filling your life with more happy memories. If your goal is only to work more, then will you ever reach your goal? Surely a life spent with no relaxation or time just to breathe is more of a waste than one with less stress and happiness. Yes you need to work hard, but you need to play hard too, this balance is importance. It seems as if work or leisure are two separate things, but can't we have both? Although you say each second you \"waste\" could be used to gain knowledge to make you more successful, you could have also spent those few seconds appreciating the world around you, the people around you, the family around you. After all, a clear mind has more room to understand new things than one already crumbling under stress. No matter how knowledgable or \"successful\" you are, in the end we are all people and once our lives are over, they are equally over. I for one fall as a victim to over stress about work and have lost many opportunities in life because of it. Yes, without work we do not get rewards, but we need to spend time appreciating the rewards life has giving us too.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Ethan Hamilton"}

This is a motivational video, not \"Every parent ever\". I mean I get it that most of the people use video games as a drug of some kind and yes those people need to get their shit together and start being productive but there are some people that are happy with their life spent on video games and in clubs. If you tell them that the only way of spending time usefully is by reading books, then they will believe that they are usefull only when they read and some day they are gonna realise that they never accomplished their dreams, instead they spent their life doing \"the right thing\". What I suggest and personally do is: every day spend an hour or so doing what you really want to. The rest of the day you can do what society wants you too (read books, study, be smart, be productive and all that shit). And I suggest you to get your shit together because if you really need a motivational video to encourage you to kick ass then you are not believing in yourself.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "SvenSekulic"}

I believe in myself and encourage others but it's always me that's the least smart, least intelligent person that I seem to know. I wasn't born intelligent, I'm not good at maths, I have depression. I am stubborn. I'm 20 years old. I don't know what my life purpose is. And many people don't either. If you read all this you either have a good heart or you're bored.
