But for a guy who had a 600 series Thinkpad as his prized possession in high school, and trust me mid 1998 it was something, my t420 brings back fond and uber cool memories and then some. But what bothers me isn't just the price. The t series line was never a cheap business series. The amount of bloat that came with my t420 out of the box was frightening. Even the bing bar was installed! For some of you that fix might be to upgrade to Windows 10, that's fine. I usually run Mint Linux, so I get it. But choices aside for a business class computer in that price range, you would expect better. Yet, anyone who has had to deal with ThinkVantage, or finding a set of restore disks (because you can't simply download a Windows imagine from Lenovo until recently) knows finding the disks is just the start. As a bonus, you can avoid the bloat by using only the first disk and installing the drivers after the fact. But that defeats the purpose if you ask me of easily setting up these types of computers and when your doing 100s, thats a lot of time. My guess is this is probably why we now see mostly Dell in enterprise. Not even HP can easily compete with what Dell has in that area. But most people who love these Thinkpads have long lost all this stuff to start with or are willing to put up with the troubles to own a 2nd to none laptop. Not that I would personally recommend anything past the t430 with it's chiclet keyboard.

{"cid": "UgyQ4dzWYJlsOwoXvWJ4AaABAg", "text": "Put Arch Linux on this thing and you have my next laptop upgrade. :) Better than my old Dell Latitude E6410 am I right? It's nice to see there being another laptop made that has an actual keyboard on it. I cannot type on these crappy \"Ultra thing\" laptops these days because the keyboard doesn't feel right to me at all. You cannot type on that thing and then type on my laptop then easily want to go back to typing on a MacBook or something. It does not feel right. The keyboard on these things are great. The only thing I have to say about this. The display? Terrible, CPU? Terrible. RAM, 4GB of DDR3 is not enough for me. Hard drive? Well a 3100 rpm laptop hard drive from 2010 does not age well lets just say that. Yes, a lot of this stuff I can just upgrade for myself but just to future proof this thing would cost me as much to just buy a new laptop. OH I FORGOT THE 2 INCH TOUCHPAD! With complimentary top and bottom buttons, that are half the size of the touchpad itself. I have a mouse for this. It's that bad. I choose to sit on my couch with a mouse hooked up, beside me on the cushion. But then the viewing angles on this laptop holy shit it is the worst. I can't even look at this laptop head on, at a perfect angle without seeing discoloration. That's right. If I was looking at the display at a perfect angle, no matter what I would see black somewhere on the display. Displays really came a long way. Compared to my phone there is no single color that looks the same. Colors don't even look like that color and I have a Google Pixel 2 XL so that is really setting the bar. (SARCASM BIO\"ADVERTISER FRIENDLY CONTENT\") Compared to my Pixel 2 XL, which the reviews for this phone's display was terrible. The colors were the worst part about it, everything looked drab and nothing was right, compare that to my laptop I mean oh my god. If you pay me for the shipping to send this laptop over to you guys you can see for yourselves Linus. Put it on your videos or something and slap a LTT sticker on the back of it and send it back. Or keep it, just make sure that I have a Raspberry Pi 3 Plus cluster at the very least. Because I really do not need to spend all that money on a new laptop which I should buy me a gaming PC not a laptop but I need to be able to do my school work on it, at school. Last time I checked desktop's were not very portable. I'd take that hulking monstrosity that has that 5GHz Core i9 off your hands. I'll gladly trade you for that. But I would not take that piece of trash Core i9 MacBook Pro. I know that you guys don't even want that and I don't either. I compile a lot of software on my laptop. I don't need my laptop to be 240 F or 100C before the fan even turns on. What would even be the point of having a Macbook if you were going to put Linux on that? Not like that they have better performance or anything over the other laptops that you could get for cheaper. How much are these 2017 Think pads? Next time they come out with one I might just buy me one. If it has the keyboard. If it doesn't that's a no deal.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "xXx420PuZZiDeZtroyer69xXx"}

{"cid": "Ugwq355Fa23eDyvhdrx4AaABAg", "text": "So I am not as old as Linus (not saying he is old, saying he is older than me lol) as I am only 18, BUT when I was little I loved computers and even gaming on them, but my family was pretty broke most my life, my dad did have some older stuff laying around though. My first laptop was a Dell Lattitude CP, it had a 233MHZ Pentium 2 processor, 64MB of ram and a 5GB HDD with Windows 98SE. Now I don't remember what graphics it had, but I know it didn't have almost any 3D support. This laptop is what got me into gaming though as I found two old game discs in one of my dad's old boxes, Earthsiege 2, and Need For Speed 2, I managed to get them both running and played those for hours upon hours. Now this was back in about 2007, later I got upgraded to my dads old Dell Lattitude C810, with a 1.13GHZ Pentium 3, a GeForce 440GO with 32MB of VRAM, a 20GB hard drive, 256MB of RAM, and Windows 2000, with 98 installed as well, it also had a 15 inch 1600x1200 display I think, I know it was high for its time. I played so many old games on that such as the previous two games, Jetfighter 4, the old Star Wars Battlefront series and many more. I could even run Star Wars Empire At War on it, low settings of course but with playable framerates. The IBM Thinkpad was a good laptop, and one thing they beat Dell on was their cases, we had one just a bit newer than that 560 and me and my siblings dropped that thing so many times and it never cracked. But Dell definitely had better laptops in other aspects, their trackpads were actually pretty good, and those nipple things just plain suck, I would take even some of the worst trackpads over one of those crappy things, they were just plain crap. But Dell had the better laptops in terms of performance, reliability (except the cases were easier to crack) and usability as Dell supported many operating systems on those and you can still get those drivers from them today! I think it would be awesome to see a video comparing an old Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop to a modern one, just for old times sake.

You can buy an older T420 for under 200$, throw in SSD and it's basically the same thing (maybe throw in i7-2670QM as well and you're basically on the same level with this shite, and you're still under 400$)\n\nLenovo just had bunch of 940MX's in the warehouse and thought \"fuck it, people have boner for the retro thinkpad, they'll eat anything we throw at them\". Like seriously give me one (1!) good reason why not go for MX150 instead which has same power consumption but is 50% more powerful. And why the fuck not quad core 8th gen Intels? Lenovo was already using them on IdeaPads and Yogas long before Retro was introduced. \n\nTheir target consumers are - as Hart Henry mentioned - the oldschool guys who just don't care how much it costs and what it does as long as it's advertised as the \"good ole' Thinkpad with \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"modern\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" specs\"\n\nBut I really hate the fact that Linus is actually advertising it as a good sell to regular people. For me it's striking obvious that he sold his ass to Lenovo.\n\nAlso btw. this has nothing to do with IBM, Lenovo just added the colorful logo because people requested it...

Thinkpad themselves admit this, the next will return some of the features that made thinkpad great. The trackpad and nipple ergonomics where completely ruined for example. Impossible to not hit the trackpad with your palm if you use the nipple, this is made even worse by not having hard buttons which results in right clicking everything you don't want to. I legitimately get more work done on my old thinkpad than the new one because of the lack of life quality features from old thinkpads. Small details like lack of dedicated multimedia keys, odd laptopesque keyboard layout (unlike the desktop keyboard layout of older thinkpads), bad trackpad position in relation to the nipple, the battery which can no longer be used as a grip while standing (something that was a godsend for me in my workshop), the lack of physical mouse buttons which causes frequent misclicking, and finally the shabby build quality, which to be fair is good by today's standards but doesn't feel like a machine that will survive the tough environment i work in.

This is a modern laptop with a different keyboard. its not retro in any way. Don't think about it as a retro laptop and then maybe there's not so much to get angry about. Remember - Lenovo didn't have to do this. Its a one off. 4:3 display is impossible to source. lid is too thin for the ThinkLight. they reused existing motherboard due to it being a one off model. The only 14\" laptop with a more powerful CPU is the heavier T470p. And that has the same GPU as the TP25. There is no 14\" business laptop with a better GPU at the moment. (no XPS is not a business laptop, look at the Latitude line). And when has the Thinkpad had a great screen? Go look at your venerated T61 again and tell me again look past the 4:3 aspect ratio and thats when you realize its a crappy TFT screen with CCFL backlighting. Also this is not advertised as a workstation (a la the P series). Lets look at the specs again, now compare the ports keyboard removable battery and wwan options to other similarly priced notebooks like the Macbook Pro with the stupid gimmicky touch bar and no ports and a shit keyboard or the MS Surfacebook 2 which costs $500 more and tell me again how this is overpriced.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Tong Zou"}

IT (hence the ports, robust-ability, expand-ability), even the shelf in a mainframe is made for a thinkpad ffs! The thinkpad (with its 2 mouses etc) is designed for the IT professional. The Mac, designed for old people (I worked for Apple retail, our target market was old people hence the classes in store) with expendable incomes.\n\nI hear you about the use of Macs in design, although more of a statement then necessity (see LMG, no Macs). College, not really. Work, define? Tbh all you have said for the Mac is if you have money to burn like a design company, a student or a profitable company then you'll use one, but not ever need one. Plus most of these companies use these Macs for many years, you still see late 2009 27\" macs in design scenarios. Again status symbol, if you don't provide an office full of macs your not going to get any talented designers. Proves how stupid your argument is.\nSoldered 8GB ram, built in battery, CPU throttling with NO cooling, limited software and no ports. £2000. Sold to the idiot with too much cash to wave about ;) Even then new iMac has a proprietary CPU socket ffs! (you can upgrade the CPU in the thinkpad).\nThis video is about a ThinkPad, not a mac, or a mac wannabe. A ThinkPad. They make that very clear in the video. IT professionals and business people, not designers with coke under their noses, or housewives in Starbucks. Professionals. Simple.\n\nNot sure where these Apple fanboys came from but a Mac and a ThinkPad are about as similar or relevant as the Switch and a ThinkPad. Totally different use case and product.

I'm not discounting the capability of a ThinkPad in an IT environment, but to dismiss Apple computers to elderly citizens and idiots with too much money is absolutely absurd.\n\nWorking in a creative industry, both in photography and audio production, I can tell you that one of the main highlights of Apple products is standardization. This may seem like a drawback to the power-lusting, IO-crazed average pc user, but is one of the main selling features of Apple computers. \n\nIf you'll take a look at the industry standard audio production software, Avid Pro Tools, you'll notice they have amazing Apple support and terrible PC support (within a guideline). This is because while there are thousands of configurations of PCs that come out a year, there are a very limited number of variations for a mac. This makes it easier to design software that runs its best within a tailored environment. Many software companies in creative industries work this way because it's the most efficient way to function. \n\nI can also tell you from personal use, I'm still using a 2008 MacBook, and a 2009 Mac Pro to handle all my session work. Why? Because it simply just works still. I've had no reason to upgrade because all my software (that is all within the last 2 years of development updates) continues to function just fine for my needs. When I update one day, I'll be buying a mac again because they simply function for what I need.

For example my company just bought a batch of HP Elitebook 840 G4's with 512 GB SSD, I7 processor, 1440p screen (no touchscreen), and 16 GB of RAM for about $1700. Add extra warranty services and it comes out to about $1900. The 840 is probably a little bit nicer due to the higher resolution screen, but know that it is fairly common practice currently for business class laptops to charge a high premium compared to consumer laptops.

Any other laptop can do the same things a thinkpad can (except of the red nipple ofc, but given how good trackpads are nowadays, the nipple is more of a gimmick than a useful feature). My friend and I bought a lenovo laptop almost at the same time, while I got a deal for a thinkpad, my friend got a deal for an ideapad. The non-discounted price is identical for both model and configuration we bought, except his was an i7 quad core and mine is an i5 dual core. (my model has an i7 version, but without the discrete gpu, ofc at higher price) Both of our laptops are big 15in models, exact same specs other than the cpu, but his came in a partial metal body and was lighter while mine was entirely plastic and came with horrible downward firing speakers. As for ruggedness, I do not see reason either. The most vulnerable part, being the hdd is just a standard mounting mechanism and no harware redundancy as the features came in all as the included bloatware. It is just a scam because you are paying for a worse laptop and getting bloatware in return.\n\nNowadays, hdds are often opted out of laptops, which make vibration and drops a non-issue in data integrity. The lighter weight also helps in reducing impulse suffered by the laptop, which proves the thinkpad lineup is redundant for the mainstream. In fact I think the lower end offerings in the thinkpad line up ruins the thinkpad branding on the extreme high end where every tiny bit of extra durability is absolutely needed.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Nicholas Lau"}

I'm stunned by how few people mention this absolutely unforgivable, deal-breaking oversight. I'm sorry, but I just can't use clickpads - that travesty that Apple unleased upon the world by copycat designs. Touchpads need buttons. Thumb rests in the lower-left edge of the pad, ready to click things. Tapping is good for silent clicks (but even the Thinkpads had soft-click buttons), but beyond that? Clickpads are absolutely awful. As you go for a click, the action of pressing harder on the pad usually moves the cursor as well. Having my thumb resting on that corner of the pad almost always causes problems (as it drifts up and down, on and off the click area, it causes unwanted movement). Heck, I can almost FPS-game on a touchpad - it's so embedded in muscle memory. Thankfully, it's come back with the Dell Latitude 7480 laptop (top of my wishlist), but I can't believe Lenovo made this deal-breaking mistake on the Anniversary Edition - the one thing that made a ThinkPad for me.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Matt Falcon"}

It may be a throwback, but its lamentable lack of options with a very lacklustre CPU make this machine more of a novelty if you ask me. Also, the keyboard is a severe point of contention among present Lenovo customers who have demanded that very keyboard be put into their other lines of products. For years Lenovo have said it could not be done with backlighting, so they chose to pitch it and redesign a staple of the ThinkPad design which kept customers coming back to the line over the years. Now, the 25th Anniversary edition comes to town, and what does Lenovo include? Nothing but that same keyboard with backlighting that they claimed was impossible to deliver on models in the past! You have no options for different displays as even the old IBM model you reference did, and you are stuck with a touchscreen even if you rarely or never use it, and let us not forget the only graphics option that ships with the unit, a middle of the road dedicated GPU on a laptop that is supposed to marketed to people who need a laptop that will last for some amount of years and is built for specific tasks like CAD, 3D modeling, etc. This was a nice homage by Lenovo, but it should have come with options, been priced much more competitively, limited run notwithstanding, and the few endearing features from Lenovo should have been made available in models they were already selling four and five years ago.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Tyler Barton"}

Don't get me wrong; it's a nice option that I've missed, but when you look at the battery life on a single pack (and with a 1080p panel??) it's not that fantastic. Good, but not fantastic. On that note, for $1900 why isn't there at least a 1440p panel? This is by no means an ultra light, so there isn't an excuse for all these misgivings. You also have to remember that even with strong build quality there's still a lot of plastic in it's construction. It's just not a good deal for the price.

People like Louis and I don't just care about the keyboard; in his opinion (see his video on the keyboard and TrackPoint) and mine, the new chiclet keyboards are just as good as the old.  However, \"real ThinkPad users,\" the enthusiasts and fans who will actually buy this, are people who want usability and function (over form) for them instead of fancy, special packaging.  I do a lot of programming, and a 4:3 display, like the old ThinkPads, make a very noticeable difference in productivity; ThinkPads weren't made for media consumption, they were made (not as much so now) to be the best for work tasks, like programming.  Also the CPU and GPU are both too weak; most \"real ThinkPad users\" need workstation-level power (like the P series), not a dual-core CPU and a GPU that can't do more than basic acceleration.  Also, as Louis points out, the 1080p screen, while good enough for most people, is very outdated as of today.  And the problem with all of this is that there are no options; you can't get a quad-core CPU and more powerful GPU if you wanted, you can't get a good screen, and you can't get more than one retro feature.  And many people (including myself) would be willing to pay several hundreds of dollars more for these upgrades.  Poor specs plus poor implementation of retro (basically just a T570 with a different keyboard) equals a failed product for real ThinkPad users and enthusiasts.  (And, yes, the T470 and T470p are great laptops, but they are for a completely different market of people than the Retro; they are for mainstream business users, not enthusiasts and fans of the brand who will be looking for a Retro.)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Christopher Dix"}

Go look at your venerated T61 again and tell me again look past the 4:3 aspect ratio and thats when you realize its a crappy TFT screen with CCFL backlighting. Also this is not advertised as a workstation (a la the P series) Lets look at the specs again, now compare the ports keyboard removable battery and wwan options to other similarly priced notebooks like the Macbook Pro with the stupid gimmicky touch bar and no ports and a shit keyboard or the MS Surfacebook 2 which costs $500 more and tell me again how this is overpriced.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Tong Zou"}

Note that the T470 can not get dedicated graphics like the TP25 can. Also note: how many 14\" business laptops have dedicated graphics anyways? Another is the retro stuff, this was all explained by Lenovo in their unboxing video: the ThinkLight is not there because the lid is too thin to add it. The display is not 16:10 or 4:3 because it would have to be custom made in large numbers to be financially feasible and this is a limited run laptop. So basically this is a T470 with dedicated graphics and an upgraded keyboard, thats it. its not retro in any way. but is that a bad thing? not necessarily.

You can really tell the extreme lack of quality when there's a thinklight button, and no thinklight on the laptop. It's all of the unnecessary problems and compromises of modern laptops, for a ridiculous price point.\nDo not purchase this.

On these, ONE SCREW is all you need to remove the ram door, and open the keyboard, letting you get to all of the main parts you would need to for most services. I understand more screws isn't harder, but in places, they use less screws and replace them with these plastic click tabs, it is not very nice clicking off the palmrest that is in one piece (it used to come in two seperate pieces, much nicer when taking off), sometimes accidentally snapping off the little plastic parts. This is really bad in the screens too, normally I have to get off the little rubbery cover and unscrew it, now there is just snap into place plastic only, which I need a special tool thing that fits in the gap, which gets more broken each use, and I need to be cautions of not putting pressure on the screen and in the end, I usually end up ordering a new screen bezel, because the first one snaps or all of the little tabs on one side have snapped off. I understand I am not the most steady hand at removing these, but it really should be easier than this !\nI see that there is an OSD with the number lock and caps lock, but it fades away a few seconds after you enable/disable, and these OSD I really have trouble getting to work properly again after installing annother windows installation, and for linux users (which is large on thinkpad market), they do not get any option at all. The need for number lock light is that the number lock keys overwrite the keyboard keys, I can see problems happening where a user accidentally enables the number lock or leaves on, and then mistypes as it is left on, and for not the most knowing of the users, can get very confused of why this is happening on the keyboard, as they cannot see that the number lock is on. I do not see what you mean by the 'why would you want to know if numlock was on when the computer wasnt on', lights like number lock are not powered when the computer is on, it is a visible to see if number lock is enabled or not, without something covering the screen or taking space in the system tray.

Before I begin I will clarify that I am a computer hardware specialist in the military and use a Librebooted T400 as my daily use laptop and have a W520 with Windows 10 as a desktop replacement. Okay now I'll start. \n\"-that would still hold up today?\"\nYour point of comparison is of a 20 year old laptop. Maybe I'm cherry-picking by saying this, but of 20+ year old hardware IBM would have the best stuff that even still performs. My T400 is now almost 10 years old, and it still has the classic keyboard which is the main point drawn by Thinkpad fanatics and collectors in terms of when they stopped being good- not if they were being made by IBM. In which case the best comparison would be with a T420 or W520. Now talking about specs, my T400 outspecs half the current Chromebook market. So yes, I'd say that these computers hold up. Now, this laptop specifically I'm not sure. It is barely an upgrade from my W520- mostly with innovation in size. This is also not a gaming laptop, but if you really wanted to you could. Esports titles like CS:GO will run on those specs if at ~720p and low setting with 60+ fps. I don't know.

{"cid": "UgxiKc5qJdchTzJzAdV4AaABAg", "text": "Really was hoping for a viable replacement for my T420, I'm definitely starting to feel the age of it (Sandy Bridge/2011 era). However, it still has superior design and features to any Thinkpad models since then. Was hoping they'd go back to the pinnacle of ThinkPads (T420/520 for me, there's some differences of opinion on that of course), and just take the best ThinkPad they made, review the weak points of it and improve those, and call it a day. Basically, a T420 with a better screen (better quality panel, better resolution, better aspect ratio; the T420 screen sucked in every way)... and that's it. T420 with a better screen, that's all that was needed to create an awesome (read: useful) ThinkPad. (And, obviously, the obligatory update to internals and I/O). Instead we get the same thing as their modern ThinkPads, but with a different keyboard. Which is great, but it's not nearly enough to make it a replacement for an actual ThinkPad. So... Still waiting for a replacement. Might just swap mine for a T520 just so I can get a better screen and quad core in the meantime...\n\nLenovo markets the whole retro ThinkPad thing as a collectible memorial piece, they seem to have misunderstood completely. I have work to do. The people who want a ThinkPad with some of the older design decisions aren't asking for it out of sentiment. We don't want it because it's old, we just want whatever is better for getting our stuff done. It just so happens that their older designs are better for getting work done than their newer designs, so we want the older ones, but the fact that they're older is basically just happenstance, it has nothing to do with why we want them to design a laptop in that way. Sadly, beyond the keyboard, not much of the old design decisions have been re-implemented, and to top it off the specs are pathetic for the price. I'm kinda surprised Linus didn't rip it to shreds considering it's $1,900 for a dual-core, 940 MX, 1080p machine in 2017. I mean... good lord.\n\nAnyway, so I'm still waiting for a successor to my 2011 model.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Glenwing"}

I got mine to use as a school laptop. The stylus is incredibly useful for diagrams/written notes, the build quality is remarkable, it has a good array of I/O, the fingerprint reader is a huge time-saver, and the battery life is solid, and the keyboard is amazing to type on. It also has the trackpoint, which I actually find myself missing when I use other laptops, and the way that the keyboard border raises up when flipping the screen into tablet mode is a super-smart idea that I wish was implemented on other 2-in-1s, as it makes it easier to hold without needing to worry about damaging the keys, and when the keyboard border is up, rubber feet also raise up around the keyboard to hold it above the surface you place the laptop on (in stand or tablet mode) to prevent the keyboard from picking up crumbs and dirt from the table. It is  a brilliantly designed device and I wish more devices had  these sort of features. My favourite thing, however, is that they are super-cheap on ebay, some even brand new. Some sell as low as £200-400 if you get your bid in at the right time :)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ByteOfBlender"}

Nevertheless: ThinkPads nowadays are crapboxes, so are EliteBooks. Everything has to look good and needs to be light as f**k. No, it doesn't! The old HP Elitebooks, like the 8470w were built like tanks. They could survive drops from the table all day, they could be upgraded, the fan could be changed in a matter of minutes - even the old Thinkpads were good in that regard-, and they didn't overheat nor throttle when you pushed them all day long. Now you have to rip out the whole motherboard to even get to the freaking fan!

It's not going to be any more expensive than any other laptop, barring some price increases for a made-to-order screen if the aspect ratio they want isn't already being manufactured, which is no excuse. Even Apple can make a machine with decent specs and a made-to-order screen at $1300, it's nonsense to say making a new ThinkPad, which they do every year anyway, but just pull design decisions that they made further in the past instead of design decisions from more recently in the past, and a made-to-order screen, would make it cost beyond what anyone would pay.\n\nThe problem is the whole limited edition thing, the price is high because they aren't going to sell many units, so the development cost isn't spread out among lots of sales. If they hadn't gone with the whole \"collectors edition\" mentality and just realized people want a laptop to do work on, and approached it from a large scale main channel sale perspective, it could have come out a lot better and a lot cheaper.
