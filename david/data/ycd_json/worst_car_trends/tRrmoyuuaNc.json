The driver \n(human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. It's what \nyou've been doing all along.Level 1: This \ndriver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled \nby the driver, but a specific function (like steering or accelerating) \ncan be done automatically by the car.Level 2: In\n level 2, at least one driver assistance system of \"both steering and \nacceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving \nenvironment\" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. It \nmeans that the \"driver is disengaged from physically operating the \nvehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel AND foot off \npedal at the same time,\" according to the SAE. The driver must still \nalways be ready to take control of the vehicle, however. Level 3: Drivers\n are still necessary in level 3 cars, but are able to completely shift \n\"safety-critical functions\" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or \nenvironmental conditions. It means that the driver is still present and \nwill intervene if necessary, but is not required to monitor the \nsituation in the same way it does for the previous levels. Jim McBride, \nautonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said this is \"the biggest \ndemarcation is between Levels 3 and 4.\" He's focused on getting Ford \nstraight to Level 4, since Level 3, which involves transferring control \nfrom car to human, can often pose difficulties. \"We're not going to ask \nthe driver to instantaneously intervene—that's not a fair proposition,\" \nMcBride said.Level 4: This is what is meant by \n\"fully autonomous.\" Level 4 vehicles are \"designed to perform all \nsafety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an \nentire trip.\" However, it's important to note that this is limited to \nthe \"operational design domain (ODD)\" of the vehicle—meaning it does not\n cover every driving scenario.Level 5: This \nrefers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's \nperformance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving \nscenario—including extreme environments like dirt roads that are \nunlikely to be navigated by driverless vehicles in the near future.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Doug H.

The good part of all of this is that many many people were saved from death by autopilot and many more by the solid structure of the car where any other car would have crumpled up on them or caught fire. You always hear the distortion when a Tesla does have a fire but it's a slow and controlled fire unlike the gas-powered vehicles that explode on impact. Tesla is now the safest car you can buy...surpassing all the other makes in safety but you don't hear about those stats because Tesla is eating up the market share of gas cars as gas cars sales plummet in a spiral to bankruptcy. Anyways, thanks for your wise observation...and yes, this guy makes other videos too that are full of shit. The more you watch, the dumber you get.
