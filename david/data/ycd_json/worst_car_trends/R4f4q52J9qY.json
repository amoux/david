Firstly the Porsche is by a long, long stretch the best daily driver, the all around most accurate, communicative and best looking with probably the highest residual on resale. It is probably the best driving in most real world situations, the most comfortable, the most amenities etc. The shelby is more or less about the equivalent of a 911 GTS model so pound for pound the Porsche GTS would cost around 120k. The McLaren I believe costs around 185k making it by far the most expensive car here. Hey if you are a 1% go for it! I like McLarens but of the newer models they have poor resale values. The seats are NOT comfortable over the long hall and the car is not that practical but they look cool, sound cool etc. Wonder if the look of the front fascia will look dated in under 10 years.

Even the Germans are screwing with us, Porsche is reallllly trying to stop Chevy from fixing the vital differential on the Z06 to fix its major oversteer.

The corvette is faster, handles better, looks better, sounds better, is Miles faster, brakes harder, and is better equipped with a dozen toys and technology options the likes of which the lotus does not have- and it's only 145 lbs heavier. Meanehile the lotus base model costs 24,000 dollars more than the Vette, and the Vette comes totally optioned out at 92k- that includes the carbon discs and aero and tech packages. 89k for a base lotus or 92k for the loaded GS that's faster and better in every way. This- this is what's wrong with lotus right now. The 400 is a good car, not a great one, like the grand sport, but they sell it at that ludicrous price.

Fully loaded model is what MT tests as does Porsche for top speed on all its cars.\nGT4 is a great car but Porsche did not tune it to just under the S for any reason. They slotted each car to fill a certain performance range.\nPorsche could put a 911 GTS engine into a Cayman or even a GT3 engine into a Cayman which would be an almost perfect car. That is an \"IF\" not a reality.

A pro can push the 350 in away the average man can't without getting killed. The Porsche is so well planted that you can push it closer to the edge without dying. Secondly none of this is about build quality or materials which do make a difference in terms of how a car feels and what it costs. The 350 is a good car for the price but try sitting in one for a few min vs the Porsche and you quickly learn where your money goes. These are all new cars. Part of what you pay for ,in higher end sports cars, is the materials and build which is measured in the years to come. Find a 10 year old Mustang and see how its held up vs a 10 year 911.

And I can hear you say \"interior shmerior\" , but if you think about it, that's what you are going to be seeing 90% of the time, and 100% of the time while driving. I had the opportunity to test drive a Camaro Z21, and quite frankly as soon as I sat down I thought:\" Wow, I just don't care how good this car is to drive, this is fugly!\", no kidding, it looked like the interior was designed by a 4 year old with a box of crayons over recess :) Never mind the materials, there was really ugly plastic everywhere... \nSorry, I just don't want to drive that car, no matter how good it is. The way I see it, interior design for a car has to be either pure function, almost race car like, there is a certain beauty about that, or it has to be gorgeous to look at. \nAnd as a minor thing, but that's getting to be a bigger thing every year that passes for me, I guess I'm getting old :) A car  that is loud all the time is just god damn obnoxious,. Don't get me wrong, I love the sound of a finely tuned engine, be it a V12, V8 or V6, and it's great when you want to push it, but then I have to drive this thing around town, maybe even take it to work a couple of times, and that's when gets to be too much.. One of the reasons I sold my mint 93 camaro about 8 years ago, it had a borla exhaust that sounded great, but the damn thing would never quite the hell down! Take a trip of any considerable length on that and it starts to get on your nerves, never mind just trying to get from point a to b...

And for  that reason it is pointless to bring price into calculation.\n\nBut I have to agree that they use a system that considers many factors and one of them factors is that \"we can look past many flaws if its a good 'ol murican V8\".\n\nBut yeah, they have to put on a show because otherwise porsche would probably win every year.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Aur0n"}

So yes its a bad analogy!\nA Patek watch costing $30,000 has one task to perform not 30!\nA car has MANY tasks/ jobs that make it a bad,average,good or great car!\nA watch does not need to perform differently if I'm going to be running vs walking or if I come to a sudden stop. A car does! I don't need to drive my watch, sit in my watch for hours or insure it handles well at over 100mph! I do need to be able to drive my sports car thus the different elements. Engine,chassis,suspension,steering,tires not to mention safety and comfort! What was the last watch that scored poorly on a safety test??\nAgain poor analogy which can't be saved by comparing the number of moving parts in each.\nSecondly hate to break it to you but Porsche is owned by VW meaning its made with a great many parts it shares with other brands like Audi and VW so no its not a small car maker. Big R&D that comes from making Porsche filters down to car like VW and Audi which off set the cost of building the Porsche.\nQuote\n\"Exotic cars have manufacturing value,combined with very unreasonable prestige value that just comes from being desirable\"\nACCORDING TO WHOM??

The rest is nothing more than YOUR opinion.\nUnlike a critique of the Z06 which finished last in this competition last year. What are the odds of a brand new high end muscle car breaking? American built Muscle car that is!\nTry looking at cheap build quality and poor engineering when you think about the price point of American cars vs companies like Porsche. That unlike your assertion is supported by facts. See reliability scores on the American cars!\nAgain see the wonderful Z06 until it started breaking down at the 5000 mile mark.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Steve Jovan"}

The two have next to no overlap whereas all watches have one task that being to tell time.\nA 911 owner is not trying to get from one particular place to another in many cases. Its just the driving experience for many. Car goes out and comes back without any other goal or even route in mind. Who on earth takes a mini van out for a drive???\nSo in the end you decided to reject you initial point. Great given its means you now concede why it is that Porsche is a better car. Note that you admit that while leaving out your previous position given what buyer paid for this cheaply made ford products.\nLastly R&D is a huge part of development so yes Porsche takes a lot from its other cars and applies the technology to its sports cars. Do you need a list of what Porsche puts into it SUV's for instance that translates from their sports cars and vice versa! Yes the PDK that you find in a Panamerica,Macan and Cayenne is the same one you get in the 911.

These cars are tested on the track and on closed long California winding back roads. What about in LA,SF,Chicago,Boston,NYC,or Houston traffic,all of which are considered the worst in the US? Bet a lot of these cars wouldn't be much fun to drive then.\n\nTaking heavy traffic out of the equation,what about just tooling around town at 35~45 mph? Is that McLaren still a great Driver's car?For example, I know that almost every review has said that the GT-R(previous years)is pretty terrible as a daily driver. What about the others?The Viper was the first car eliminated because it's good at only one thing,but you guys completely left out THE most common driving conditions,and that's daily driving.\n\nI hope that next year's list and video will at least try to address this. I would give more thought and insight to how each car drives in more  normal conditions.And I'm not asking for how these cars drive in the rain or snow,but at least just cruising around town.\n\nThanks again guys.

These performance cars we talk about, they usually have sub standard build quality (that is why they are cheap) and if the price is going to increase too much, they will not find customers in Europe or other parts of the world. As a private person, very few will buy any of these big engine sports cars as gas costs a lot in Europe. Maybe if you buy it as company car or get your gas paid by the company. Even the big engine/power euro cars are bought by rich people here in Europe thanks to gas prices. We all thought the new Stingray would conquer the world. But what happened? It's nowhere to be found and I actually like that car.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Fast Er"}

{"cid": "UgjolibAutXuxHgCoAEC.8JCnKW7nxDf8MVTLl5dTQ4", "text": "+Fast Er -- Firstly, the Camaro SS 1LE is NOT a track car! It is called a track package but other than great brakes, GM magnetic shocks (which Ferrari uses) and VERY small spoilers/nose wings, it is a regular SS. Let's not go overboard there on saying it is a TRACK car. In comparison, the GT350R is more of a track package since it has large spoilers, an illegal street exhaust and the like. You also seem to forget when comparing the GT350R and Camaro 1LE to some of these cars, it is 2 wheel drive (RWD), not all wheel drive (AWD) which DRASTICALLY changes what is needed as far as tyre size. Give these cars credit because it is certainly due! They are true, cross country able cars, unlike the Viper ACR, which has no A/C and is uncomfortable as hell. Having said that, I didn't hear any complaints about lack of comfort in the McLaren 570S. It was the quickest, which is should be around this track for a driver's car which includes all the creature comforts. Why in the hell are we going on about the M4 again? LOL! Check this video if you DO care about Nurburgring times. The 2017 ZL1 Camaro w/10 speed automatic ran a 7:29.60 on a very good, but not perfect lap which is 12 seconds quicker than the last ZL1 and 7 seconds quicker than the 2014/2015 Z/28, which WAS a track model. This ZL1 has dual climate control A/C, backup camera, leather, power seats, power mirrors, etc. Definitely not a track car but it gets it done, QUICKLY and for as little as $62,000 USD! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4f4q52J9qY -- Cheers! \nEDIT: -- The MAIN reason the Mustang and Camaro don't make a dent in the European market has SOME to do with the additional expenses of import taxes, etc.along with Germans abundantly preferring German brands (Mercedes Benz is much more reliable than BMW today and was better in the past as well) but what you fail to include is a MUCH larger problem with the UK. They do not produce these models in RHD (right hand drive) nor will they ever because it would never be cost effective for them to do so. The vast majority of the world drives on the right side of the road so LHD (left hand drive) is where the money is. If you were the CEO and wanted to produce lower volume high performance cars for Ford or GM, would YOU have special tooling for these models which are primarily made for the U.S. market? I'm not a BMW hater, I used to own a M3 I6 coupe, a fine car. Later, I owned a M5 V8 w/ a 6-speed manual. It was a fun, mid-sized luxury car. I replaced it with a M-B E55 which was a considerable step up and my cost of ownership was less for the E55 as well. Both cars were purchased new so no, I didn't buy someone else's beater. BMWs are nice cars but they are NOT what they once were. Let's be realistic.\nYou stated you are 15. I applaud you for being so interested in performance cars. I was much like you when I was that age. Some of us have decades of experience owning and driving them and many other cars. Consider that instead of simply going on about things which you have no personal experience with.\nWe are all watching these videos for the same reason. We LOVE cars. Let's all get along instead of arguing. It is only counter-productive with negativity instead of concentrating on the positive. Fair enough?Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Racer"}

The last NSX took the super car formula and gave it a reasonable price tag with good reliability. This time around they took the Hyper car formula and did the same. If you two actually remember the original NSX wasn't all that powerful or fast but it gave people who weren't the one percent the ability to drive a reliable mid-engine screamer. Yes the NSX made the Italians have to deliver a working car but putting the expectation of an industry shake-up or watershed moment on a car just because the last one did it is extremely ridiculous. \n     The original NSX didn't push the bar in terms of technology as much as everyone tries to claim. Its the same thing here, it technically doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before but instead does it at a fraction of the price without monthly maintenance that would bankrupt most people.

Sure, they get paid to drive cars, but they definitely don't know a lot about them. They said the new GT350R is the first true handling and braking muscle car. In 1965 Ford (along with Shelby) took Cobras and GT350R's to the SCCA races. These were road races. BEFORE getting them on a drag strip. You know what happened? The Cobra's never lost a single A-Production championship until SCCA went flop. The GT350R's? They did the EXACT SAME THING IN B-PRODUCTION. Know who had the most factory support in B-Production, who the Mustangs destroyed was? Porsche. Heck, in 1969 the Boss 302's were named Car and Driver's 'Best Handling Production Car\" and they retained that distinction - even over all the famous Porsches - until 1981. Sure, brakes are better now than in 1965, but you have to compared car to car at the current time.\n\nAlso, did McLaren completely change their car? I thought it was known for having all sorts of computers to do most of the driving for you.

{"cid": "UggMG76iqiLJSXgCoAEC.8JBjsKBIRmw8J_gwLMbd5T", "text": "+Kabob21: It's not quite as simple as you put it, because $2400/ month lease for a McLaren is actually not the real price per month. They will also ask for 10% ($20,000) down with a minimum of a 780 credit rating. This actually is a discussion I have had with my god kids. \n\nJust because you could make the payment doesn't mean you can afford the car. \n\nMcLaren's are generally only insured by exotic car insurance, most of them limit you to 5-8K miles per year. And they're not cheap either, you'll probably have to spend a minimum of $300-400+ / month and you have to have full coverage (with super high limits) because of the lien on the vehicle. \n\nNext is maintaining it. I don't know what it costs to maintain one of these, but I know that Rob Ferretti has said he has paid about $9000 for two years of ownership on a late 90s Ferrari 360. Also usually these cars come with tires custom made for their application. Figure $3 to $4k for a set of tires, $2k if you get lucky (Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s cost $1600 + shipping + mount and balance) a set on TireRack.com and they're just normal). \n\nSo a two year lease = $2400/month + 20k down payment + 350/month insurance + $2k for just one set of tires + 10k for maintenance + Gas (say 2k for 2/yrs) = $100,000.00 for 2yrs of ownership and after all of that you then have to give the car back to them.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Erik Sturzebecher"}

I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, because when I think of attractive autos (form following function) I have never thought BMW. To me they are the utilitarian version of performance luxury, sort of like the camry of the performance/luxury market. I guess in a word, basic. \nI think people find it attractive not for it's shape, proportions, or details, but because it is a BMW and they project what that entails.\nKind of like an experiment I saw where they showed a picture of an average looking guy to groups of women to gauge his attractiveness. When the ladies were led to believe he had special talents and was successful in some way most women found him very attractive, even those who previously thought otherwise. By the same token if women were led to believe he was unsuccessful and had no known special talents, he was found to be unattractive or average at best. And before you say gold diggers, they had similar examples for men gauging women with similar results.\nHowever there are some extremes that despite the backstory are found attractive or not regardless. I think at best BMW is an extremely average looking car overall, however there are some exceptions like the old M1 or Z8.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Eric Michel"}

To begin with it looks better than the McLaren, it has a naturally aspirated engine and a stick shift. Also is way way way cheaper than what the other one is and this is gimmicks and politics here because even on the track was significantly faster than the McLaren with all those expensive specs that has. If i has the money to buy just one of these cars i will pick the Ford hands down. The definition of best drivers car is written all over it plus have you seen the interior of that McLaren? Not a pretty place to be in when your paying 3x the price of a car that can literally kill it on the streets and on a track night and day. Ford is the undisputed champ here and the McLaren is a car that will depreciate so much faster because the brand just makes a ton of them and they all look the damn same. \"Drivers car\" right?

I usually enjoy the humor you've brought into your videos since Jason joined the team, but it got very annoying here. Whenever you have a competition of any kind there's a story being told and as reviewers it is your job to tell us that story. It got real muddled. I understand why you liked the Shelby and why you didn't like the Viper. I never got any sense for why the Audi and the AMG weren't top 3 material (not that I like them more than the others, but what was the point of even including them in this video if you weren't going to say anything more than \"Meh\"?). I didn't even realize you liked the McLaren until the end and I'd suggest that twist endings aren't the best way to perform a car review.\n\nAgain, I want to make clear that I like a lot of what you guys do and that the lead up to this was fantastic.

I always like Best Driver's Car because it is about taking great cars and nitpicking at their differences to find the greatest for that year. It is also about what you can't just see in numbers, the feel, what the driver actually experiences. So why do I feel like there was so little of that in this video? For example, what we got in this video about the 911 Carrera S:\n\nNo on road driving footage or info\nBack seat bs with lots of acronyms\n‚ÄúWhat a time for a car with not a lot of horsepower! But a trustworthy car even in the backseat.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOn street tires.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPorsche added power and made their car even better. I never loved the 991 chassis 911s when they came out. They keep making all these improvements and man are they getting close to making the perfect 911 now!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve always loved this generation of 911, and this is the best one yet. In fact that thing could be our best driver‚Äôs car.‚Äù\n‚Ä¶3rd place trophy.\n\nSeriously?! There is no information whatsoever about how it DRIVES. It could maybe be forgiven if you glanced over a middle of the pack contender (not great or bad - even though each car in such an elite group deserves to be talked about), but a 3rd place finisher? And the 911 wasn't the only one.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I would have enjoyed this video even if you guys didn't give one word of info...the sound and cinematography is just brilliant! I even enjoy the humor. I just feel it could have been more - it could have been best DRIVER'S car.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Johan Joubert"}

For starters not all of us can afford a $200,000 super car with only like 50 more Horsepower than the Shelby.  But unlike the McLaren the Shelby has a true 6 speed manual which makes that car a better extension of the driver because they have to know how to drive the car right instead of letting a computer shift the gears for them. So in my opinion the Shelby is the better drivers car given that more people can afford it and have to be more involved with the driving experience.

But the other reason I think it should have one is because Ford is making tremendous steps with its cars and is trying new things and making it work out fantasticly. Maclaren is already known for making exceptional cars Ford hasn't made a car to compete like this is quite awhile.

Maybe I'm a cheapskate, but I'm looking at this in a different light--not the absolute best driver's car, but the best driver's car for the price. Looking at this field, it's pretty obvious that when you look at the value-for-money angle, the Mustang and Camaro are probably your best bets. Both of these cars are competing (and in some cases beating) cars that cost twice or more what they do. Sure the McLaren is a better driver's car than the Shelby, but is it $140,000 better?

They are always still a very practical choice. Especially in regards to maintenance and longevity.

Only time will tell with the voodoo i guess or the direct injection LT4....Still funny to think that GM/Cadillac produces magnetic rear suspension system and you apply it to the mustang and guess what it is that much more of a performer, some people dont know or understand this lmao....that gm is in part to thank to why the 350r is \"so much better than the camaro\" which the 1le/SS which they pit them against also has magneride lmao.

As they stated at the beginning of the video all these mid engine super/hypercars are way too fast for the street. They also said that the car must be usable on track and street. I don't think there are many roads that are smooth enough that you could really drive the 570S without being afraid of destroying the bumper\n\nA drivers car should be involving, exciting, great handling and also something you could really throw around everywhere... I think that's the GT 350R... It ticks all the boxes and is not so fast that you can't let it loose whenever you want. They even say that it is special no matter how fast your going.\n\nMotortrend needs to clean themselves up a bit.
