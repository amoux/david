{"cid": "UgxQm-wX_VftWyWJ9up4AaABAg", "text": "News  reports  on  14  May  ,  2019    say  that  China  has  hit  the  U.S.  with  higher  tariffs  effective  from  1  June  2019  on  items  including  frozen  vegetables  and  liquefied  natural  gas.   A  substantial  impact  of  Chinese  retaliatory  tariffs  seems  to  be  on  farmers.  Such  like  agricultural  commodities  as  ‚Äò soyabean‚Äô ,  ‚Äòfrozen  vegetables‚Äô  are  feared  to  be  impacted.  The  Trump  administration  is  devising  an  appropriate  aid  measure  to  farmers  to  set  off  or  compensate  them  against  likely  consequences  of  Chinese  retaliatory  higher  tariffs.  Closely  relevant  to  these  developments  ,  it  may  be  apt  to  bring  out  here  this  Vedic  astrology  writer‚Äôs  predictive  alert  to  the  U.S.  on  1  October  ,  2018.  The  said  alert  in  article  -  ‚Äú  Astrological  probable  alerts  for  the  U.S.  in  2019‚Äù  -  was  published  last  year  on  1  November  2018   in  monthly  Webzine  of  Wisdom  Magazine  at  wisdom-magazine.com/Article.aspx/4897/.  The  alert  unambiguously  and  with  absolute  clarity   relating   to   the  said  scenario  on  farmers  produce  as  a  consequence  of  Chinese  retaliatory  tariffs  announced  on  14  May  2019  is  found  described  like  this  in  the  article  :-\r\n‚Äú  3 .  June  -  July  Around  in  2019.  ..................................Hotel  industry  or   produced  commodities  having  taste  or  smell  may  be  in  the  centre  of  strategic  maneuvering  or  competition  between  U.S.  and  competing  nations.  These  trends  are  likely  to  be  there  during  the  course  of  the  year  in  some  hidden  form  but  are  expected  to  be  announced  in  April -  May  or  September  -  October  ,  in  2019.‚Äù    The  alert  is  clearly  relating  to  produce  of  farmers  and  is  confirmed  on  ground  by  the  trade  war  between  the  US  and  China.  \r\nLater  ,  separately  ,  through  another  predictive  article  - ‚Äú  World  trends  in  April  to  August 2019‚Äù  -  brought  to  public  domain  widely  in  March  and  subsequently  on  5  April  ,  2019  ,  this   writer  has  alerted  that  a  period  of  four  and  a  half  months  from  mid -  April  to  August  ,  more  so  June  ,  in  2019  ,  has  tendencies  to  give  rise  to  major  worrisome  concerns  ,  calling  for  more  care  and  appropriate  strategy.

I warned president Trump that the Chinese Communist Party couldn't be trusted, that they would stall as long as they could and whatever they signed they wouldn't comply with anyway just as with WTO. To make America Great Again we have to make America rich again and independent again. Bleeding over a trillion dollars a year between trade deficits and remittances by illegal aliens is killing us. The impact due to the multiplier effect of the principle of the velocity of money has reduced our GDP and GNI by two to three trillion dollars a year. We need to bring all manufacturing including the supply chains back to the US. Robotic Technology will help a lot because it reduces the need for manpower. The process of globalization robbing Americans off jobs, income, tax revenues began right after World War II and hasn't relented since. It's time to become independent of the rest of the world and now our one vulnerability, energy from fossil fuel has been solved. This is going to hurt the rest of the world badly. Whether President Trump knows it or not, the FED increasing interest rates will strengthen the US dollar nd economy relative to all other economies. One reason is that much of the world's debt is in US dollars. Making it harder for foreigners to get them will hurt and reduce their GDP and GNI. We're on the right path, keep going.

For instance, firing comey. The dems and republicans wanted him gone and the acting attorney general (rosenstien) wrote a memo recommending trump fire him. If the top cop in the land recommended you do something and you do it and he turns around and arrested you for it that would be entrapment.  The recommending the firing of mueller. The fact that trump had the constitutional authority to fire him along with the fact that there was no crime of collusion and trump would have obviously known that at the time proves trump wasn't obstructing. That would be like if you had a neighbor that hated you and that neighbor called the cops and said you were selling drugs and the police came to your house and asked if they could come in and look around. You ask if they have a warrant and they say no. You have the constitutional authority to tell them no. You know your not a drug dealer. Did you obstruct justice? And so on. As for the tax return demand by the ways and means committee, that's a little more tricky. The law does say that if they ask for tax returns the irs shall provide, but the ways and means committee are supposed to request tax returns to help write law not for a fishing exposition to try and find a crime. The ways and means and the rest of the democrats tipped their hand by announcing they wanted to see trumps returns so they could impeach him. Now it will be up to the judicial branch to decide whether or not the ways and means can use their authority as a political tool to impeach a president.

Do you pay for car insurance based on your income or based on your risk factors, the type of car, age and driving history ? When you buy your clothing,  do they change their prices based on your income ?\nSo, what makes you think that for public services or public places, roads, parks, schools the rules of paying should be different ? Why should be based on income ? Just think about. Is a rich person consuming the road more than you ? Is his children consuming the play ground more than your children ? Is he spending more time in parks than you ? Don't you think we all should pay the same for what we decided to be \"common goods\" ? We also pay for military. Why a rich person should pay more than you and I pay for the same thing, to protect our country. Please use some logic and try to be honest to yourself. Don't you think it would be fair that all of us pay the same for the same benefits, just like in a grocery store we pay the same prices for the same items, we pay the same price for exactly the same car at the same dealer, we pay the same price for the same food in a restaurant ? Ok, you say... the rich have more money so they should pay more to make up for poor. Jesus said to pay not the same but 10% each. Ok, 10% each. You think that should be fair. But no! Democrats never tax the rich enough. Different groups of taxes were formed, 20%, 30%, 40%, and now, they want to go for 80% if you listen to that lunatic Alexandria Cortez and not only. \nActually, all the democrats want to raise the taxes. How do you justify stealing those money from the rich and redistribute them however they want to redistribute them ? Not only that, but while their money are stolen away they are also vilified, like being successful and getting rich is a crime.

If all jobs went to $3 a day Mexicans or Haitians, or were automated, then nobody would have any money to buy anything from those stupid companies, and everything would collapse. Only a complete moron would think you could send all jobs to super cheap labour countries, and still survive. They need to sell in a market where people actually make enough money to buy their crap and make them a profit. So, no, they don't simply need workers. They also need people with money, who can afford their goods. They need a safe environment to sell their goods in. They need a decent infrastructure. Surely, if you used your brain, you'd see they aren't making their billions off of Haitian consumers. Some companies use $3 a day Haitians to cut costs, but do they sell all their goods to those Haitians? Of course not! It would be moronic to think that was feasible. No, they bring their product to the US to sell. So, even, those shit corporate leaders, like Trump, who outsource their labour, still bring the goods to the US to sell, and still benefit the most from doing business there. \n\nOh Jesus, the economy has been trending for the better, since 2009.

So far, there‚Äôs not much evidence of that. As the left-hand graphic above shows, U.S. exports to China have plummeted since June‚Äîwhile U.S. imports from China have continued to rise. Meanwhile, U.S. importers (many of whom are exporters) have seen their U.S. tariff bill more than double since May, topping $5 billion in October.  \r\n\r\n--Trump‚Äôs tariff war has some clear winners, however‚Äîhigh among them, Russia. As shown in the left-hand graphic, Chinese imports from non-U.S. firms have continued to grow at a robust 18 percent year-over-year rate while those from U.S. firms have fallen. Among the hardest-hit U.S. sectors have been soybeans, autos, and oil. Whereas China had accounted for about 22 percent of U.S. oil exports in the two years to July 2018, it fell to zero thereafter. This has proven a boon to alternative suppliers like Russia, as shown in the right-hand figure. And so, in the ultimate irony, Americans are paying tariffs that boost the profits of Russian firms subject to U.S. sanctions.\r\n\r\nTrump Lies Again About ‚ÄòChina Paying Tariffs‚Äô To The U.S. Treasury\r\nThe president‚Äôs threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods would hit American consumers, not China.\r\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-lies-china-paying-tariffs-to-usa_n_5ccf8704e4b0e4d757347bda\r\n\r\nEconomists have estimated that the trade war is costing the U.S. more than $3 billion a month.\r\nA University of Chicago study found that consumers paid an extra $1.5 billion for washing machines last year because of a Trump tariff imposed at the behest of Whirpool Corp. that only added $82 million to U.S. coffers.

Not everything Trump says or does I necessarily agree with. 10%-20% of the stuff he says or does I can't defend him on. Ex: What Trump said about John McCain (Not a war hero because he was captured), the birther movement about Barack Obama's birth certificate, he talks about bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., yet his products are manufactured in other countries (Hypocrisy), he's against illegal immigration and yet he has exploited illegal aliens for cheap labor in his organizations (hypocrisy), his affair with a pornstar, bump stock ban and windmills cause cancer etc. There are 2 things that I can and cannot defend him on. The tariffs and the Hollywood access tape. What I didn't like about Trump's trade war is that it hurt the farmers. What I liked about the tariffs is that it did bring back the steel industry. Also, there's 1 country in particular who I support taxing: China. For years, China has been cheating on trade with the US. These are 2 harmful practices China has been using: IP theft and currency manipulation. Trump is trying to ensure fair trade. The Hollywood access tape I can sort of defend him on as well. When men are alone with their friends behind closed doors, their going to make sex jokes like that. Also, let's put his words into context, he said that when you're a star and you're famous, they let you do it (insinuating consent). If he said that he would grab women's crotches without consent, I would condemn it completely. He did apologize for his comments. I wouldn't have said grab them by the pussy if I were him. The reason why those 9 things don't bother me that much is because it doesn't influence any policy/campaign promises while he's in office. Second of all, I will not use fox news as a reference to back my claim. I don't watch fox news. I listen to left wing networks more than right wing networks simply because I like to be intellectually honest and listen to what the other side has to say. With that being said, let's begin.", "time": "4 weeks ago", "author": "Ronald Matthews"}
