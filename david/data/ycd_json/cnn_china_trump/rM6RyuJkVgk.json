Probably those are bots that mentions communism, because Americans do not talk about communism, they talk about socialism and cannot tell the difference:  it has become obvious from the comments and questions addressed to progressive presidential candidates that  99.99% of population  has NO IDEA what socialism actually is. That''s what happens when public education is so low standard and an ideological term becomes such a taboo that it cannot be taught in fear someone goes to the dark side. (Only in America people are proud to be ignorant and stupid!) \n\n\nBut no thinking person would of course do that (get converted): I had Christian religious education at school for 12 years with no alternatives  - there weren't any worshippers of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism etc at the time - and I attended Sunday school at primary school age but I still didn't catch religion!  Later, in high school I learned about other religions, but I still  didn't catch religion: in fact, learning about different world views, religious and political as well as some rudiments of critical thinking skill and common sense was the best inoculation against brainwashing... Which is why the right wing is trying to convince that America is a Christian nation, although the constitution specifically separated state and church and gives everyone the freedom of religious beliefs without fear of being discriminated against. Personally, I think worshipping some despot in the sky is ridiculous but they have the right to do so without me trying to interfere or force others adopt my ideas as the only ones that are right. (Yes, despot: because if he is all powerful AND GOOD, he wouldn't allow wars and pestilence to happen - how could a small child or a baby choose between God and Devil?

He seems very focused on destruction, be it of the reputation of his predecessors (especially Obama and his ACA), DACA, international stability, rights of women, etc. He acts as a wrecking ball.

Here folks is the truth about the Bible and Trump. The Bible equates to evangelical votes from apostate Christians who themselves have not read the Bible, but instead have been indoctrinated by charlatan money serving ministers of which align themselves to the money serving politician. So¬†the Bible has become a political tool as only a fool would believe¬†that Trump¬†actually reads the Bible and takes it to heart. After reading the Bible, in particular the New Testament,¬†only a fool would believe these so called Christians are teaching and living according to undefiled scripture.¬†Theirs is a pick and chose religion, picking what scriptures they chose to accept and denying others in particular what Jesus and Paul taught about serving and hoarding up money (sin of covetousness) and about being arrogant and¬†boastful¬†about wealth. They certainly deny what Paul said in I Timothy 6:5-21 about not¬†serving God for the purpose of material gain and what he instructed pastor Timothy to charge or require of his rich church converts- to be ready and willing to distribute and communicate (share their wealth). Corrupt religion in bed with corrupt government brews a nasty cup of delusional antichrist tea. We have the Franklin Grahams the Pat Robertsons of the religious world pointing out everyone else's sins while denying their own greater sin¬†which is money loving/hoarding into the millions, and the sin of deceiving millions with their false carnal¬†doctrines and example. I Timothy 6:10- For the LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL, while some coveted after they have erred from the faith. So if this scripture is true, just how evil are these money serving multi millionaire preachers and have they not erred from the faith? Of course they have erred, and never were of the true faith, but are professionally ambitious to the degree of gluttony. ¬†Just how evil is the money loving President? Wake the hell up Christians. Study your scripture and take every word to heart lest you be a luke warm hypocrite to be spewed out of God's mouth, as you¬†have erred from the original¬†faith.

Oh, that's right, you don't have a clue.\" Another frequent incompetence-revealing equivocation he uses is in the form of \"Maybe [something] or maybe [not something].\" That one grates on my nerves, too. Of course, the main characteristic of his speaking is the constant lying and misrepresentation. Recently he was asked about Iran. It seemed to me, in that three minute response to a reporter, that he couldn't go ten seconds without misrepresenting or outright lying about something.\n\nAnd then there are his mindless, off-the-rails rants where he rambles from one thing to another. I have a file of several of those incoherent speeches. John Oliver compared one such speech to a cell phone's predictive text.\n\nOkay, for your entertainment, I'll post both of them.\nHere's what Trump said: \n\"Look, having nuclear -- my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer -- Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, okay? Very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart. You know, if you're a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, okay, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world -- it's true! -- but when you're a conservative Republican they try -- oh, do they do a number! That's why I always start off: 'Went to Wharton, was a good student. Went there, went there, did this, built a fortune.' You know I have to give my, like, credentials all the time, because we're a little disadvantaged, but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me -- it would have been so easy, and it's not as important as these lives are, nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power, and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right -- who would've thought? But when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners -- now it used to be three, now it's four -- but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger. Fellas -- and it's fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven‚Äôt figured that the women are smarter right now than the men -- so, you know, it‚Äôs gonna take them about another 150 years, but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed -- they just killed us.\"\n\n\nHere was the phone's predictive text, beginning with \"the nuclear...\":\n\"The nuclear test program was not opposed by the other person who knows what they want and then the delay is not being done by any other country and that is not the only way to make sure the world can do more things and things like that and gentlemen and then the other people who have been told to leave them alone with their children who are also very sad.\"", "time": "6 days ago (edited)", "author": "Astrobrant2"}

The Molokai channel is a desolate place, so we‚Äôd go 50 miles out. You know this part of commercial fishing. We chased the birds between Molokai and Oahu. Mahi go nuts on 9, 0 reels. Ahi take our lures and go deep in circles. Marlin decidedly wreck our gear, and we bat their heads. When you see an Ahi coming up from the depths you know that‚Äôs a thousand dollar fish. What we do is, give away our first thousand dollar fish to neighbors. It‚Äôs a good luck thing. We cut the fish in the yard, the dogs love the scraps, and our neighbors trade fish for Portuguese bean soup. We show up on the scene, the neighbors are already on the trade.

Not guilty simply means that the evidence presented at trial is not sufficient to reach a guilty verdict. In cases that aren't connected to sexual misconduct, Trump has been found guilty in a court of law several times through the years. He's been sued many times and has lost many times, the most recent of which regarding the Trump University lawsuits he had to settle for $25 million. Trump loves suing and countersuing, even if he hates losing and spending fortunes on lawyers and fines. Needless to say, he'd never admit to any of the matters I've described here.

If unemployment is really at an all-time low, how do you explain that 40% of Americans cannot afford a 400$ emergency? Furthermore, an economy that is based on interest and not on production is doomed to crash as we saw in 2008. Our economy in the US is mostly based on the capitalization of interest and not on production.\n2) The unemployment rate also means nothing. This was my main criticism of Obama. Trump did nothing to lower unemployment. He is riding Obama's coattails. So I'll direct my criticism at Obama: True unemployment is falling, but what is the quality of the jobs being created? Why are these jobs that pay shitty wages and come with no benefits? Why are a lot of them part-time or temporary? These are not quality jobs and they do nothing in improving the quality of life. It's almost like it's a title NPCs repeat for cheap political points.\n3) Let''s grant for a second that the economy is doing well and unemployment is low. It comes at the price of outright racism and bigotry, separation of refugee children at the border, alienation of European allies, participation in the demolition of Yemen, siding with dictators like giving MBS a pass for the murder of a journalist, and making public love with NK, ten steps in the wrong direction on climate change policies, a break in our democratic norms, blatant and public obstruction of justice, and an emboldening of fascist rhetoric. But sure, things are good for you, who cares about them blacks and trans folks?\n4) Billions returned from overseas? Ford? GM? Amazon paying 0 in taxes and getting subsidies? Hellow?\n5) The stock market is artificially inflated as I explained, and it only points to how rich people are doing, not how the average American is doing.

And Obama turned it all around and created 12 million jobs and increased our country GDP and ended the great recession that was created by Bush and his deregulation, the same deregulation that trump has prompted into our economy. Deregulation can sometimes help the economy, but it is very hazardous and can cause a recession. Just like it did under Bush's presidency.", "time": "6 days ago", "author": "James McCabe"}
