By valuable complexity I mean the nitty-gritty stuff you learn from doing this in a lower level language like C++. I made a RAT/keylogger in C++ I gained a ton of knowledge from it. It specifically targets the Windows platform, uses winsock to establish the connection, send commands, receive data. It sets a low-level keyboard hook with SetWindowsHookEx and takes screenshots with the help of ffmpeg I wanna make it stream video from the desktop. I learned a ton from this process and still am learning invaluable information.\n\nIt's a lot harder and more time consuming but you learn a lot more. And keep in mind, if you have any practical ideas for the keylogger then you don't wanna copy someone else's code. That's how modern anti-virus flags things is partly by heuristics but a lot is from a database of malware signatures. If your code has been used in the \"wild\" before and detected by anti-virus it will very quickly get blacklisted and won't work on most systems.Ôªø", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Ernesto Severinsen"}

The program prints into the log file a blank line (I think happens when the user switches from one window to another. You know how to fix it? Last thing: if the user does not presses enter, the program does not write anything in the log file. Thanks for the attention :) (Sorry for my bad English)Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "David"}
{"cid": "Ugj8gnHX6M46THgCoAEC.8L2IjaLTUf78Ned-X-jFVD", "text": "No problem :)\n\nI have commented the code quite heavily to try to make it easier to read. If you look at the \"\"\"if typing in new window\"\"\" section, you'll see that when you move to a new window, any text that was typed from the previous window automatically gets saved to the log, followed by a newline (the '\\n' makes a new line). If nothing was typed in the previous window then 'if(line_buffer != \"\"):' will be false and not run. The code below that if statement will always run. So every time a new window typed in, the log will start with a new line then the windows name then another new line. It might be possible that windows doesn't recognize the window name so just blank lines are printed but otherwise i'm not really sure why this problem is happening.\n\nIn regards to your last point, I have made the program so that it makes a long string of characters as you type so that when you press the backspace key, characters can be removed which makes the final output easier to read. For example if you try to type 'hello' but accidentally make a typo and type 'hekko(backspace,backspace,backspace)llo', it will end up as 'hello' in the final string. \nCurrently there are three ways to send the temporary string to the log. Pressing enter, pressing tab and when you start typing in a new window. You could try adding more ways to send the temporary string to the log if you wanted. You could make it send to the log every 10 seconds for maybe after a certain number of characters have been pressed or even after every character like in the video (but in my opinion that makes it hard to read).Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Hayden Moore"}
