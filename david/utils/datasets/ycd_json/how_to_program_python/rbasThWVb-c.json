I don't know Python, but I've programmed in many different languages over the years. With each new language, there was always some cool feature added that made me think \"Man, that one line can do what takes 10-100 lines of code in other language 'X'.\" (I'm exaggerating, but you get the point.) So, how do I know that there isn't some awesome construct, data type, logic, etc. that would condense this program to the point that it could be conceptualized and coded in 5 minutes? I don't know that, so I take the title at its word, until proven otherwise. Even your one-line description reinforces the idea that it was created from scratch.\n\nBut, then I see your eyes darting back and forth to your second screen and voilà! Illusion destroyed.\n\nOTH, I loved your video about showing a scammer who's boss. That looked like you actually wrote it off the top of your head. Did you? In any case, I dove into python using this. I installed the 'requests' library/module/thingy and followed your code, made a few changes - shuffled the list of names, used 5-10 different domains instead of pinning everything on yahoo.com, etc. - and off it goes! It's great! I love it.

Here is a small list of reasons why you'd still use python2:\n- You have a large complex python2 app and refactoring it to python3 is too expensive\n- You have an app part of critical infrastructure and refactoring is a safety risk\n- You depend heavily on, or would like to use a python2 library which is either not available or poorly ported to python3\n- You must operate in an environment where python3 is not available by default (older CentOS distros come to mind)\n\nI have no decent excuse for not writing the snake game in 3.
