How about BRICKING YOUR PHONE IF YOU REPLACE A BUTTON?  How about continually including JTAG connectors in their laptops right in the very front of the board, giving the luser bountiful opportunities to short connections?

{"cid": "UgxZ4CyGOCy_8sCtEqZ4AaABAg", "text": "People who don't see the differences between iPhone Xs/Xs Max and other android flagships are either blind or just overhated. And before you start the war my friends, I have more phones than you do. Currently using the note 9 and Xs Max both maxed out, then I have the mate 20X, the Oneplus 6T, Xiaomi Mi mix 3, Asus Rog Phone, Razer phone 2, iPhone 8 plus, Vertu signature touch, note 8, s9/s9 plus. iPhone has a lot more advantages than android phones do that the haters never admit. First is the Xs/Xs Max has better refresh and response time. If you are a gamer, a 1ms response is always better than 5 or 10 ms. The touch feeling on the iPhone is way more superior compared to others, the response time is instantly, software update regularly and I experience no lag at all, rendering time is top notch and battery life is good except if you want to charge fast then put down more money. The note 9 is very good also, good camera, design and so on but poor battery life. I'm saying this because I have to charge my note 9 twice aday compared to the iPhone and the huawei mate 20X, and yup Samsung has the best oled display period but sadly it's 60hz and touchwiz UI is shit so games and apps are locked at 30 fps. The mate 20X is my third daily driver, it has a battery enough for me to hit 1.5 days easily, camera is the best I ever use and the kirin 980 in my opinion is better than the snap 845 in term of CPU performance. Then there is the overhyped Oneplus 6T. Yeah I get it you get a snap 845, 8gb of ram, 128/256gb of storage for a cheap price....and then what? Nothing else...because the oled display on the oneplus is poor quality, the bottom firing speaker is boring and out dated, the camera is supar and the customer service is FK horrible. Out of every phone I have Oneplus is the cheapest and the most horrible when it comes to customer service. The best one gotta go to Vertu, you hear that right. I could book restaurant and hotel in couple of mins with a real assistant but man the price is hella high. Then there comes Apple, I bought the Apple Care Plus with my Xs Max. My wife threw the phone against the wall making the display shatter. They replaced it with a new one for me in exactly under 5 mins. Samsung's partners came to my house to replace the back glass of my note 8 in a day and that's pretty good. So after everything, I think the iPhone Xs/Xs Max and the note 9 still are two of the best smartphone of the year and not the 6T (its my opinion). I don't want my phone die if I accidently drop it in the water, I also don't want to call the customer service from Oneplus. I don't care if Oneplus ask $1000 for it. Just make sure you take care of your customer before you pay for reviewers to say good shit about you Oneplus lol.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Nguyen Luan"}

Inside Soundcloud app on my newly bought Note 9 I want to copy link of a particular song. And I can't do that with few gestures. On my previous device , which is iPhone SE, I can do that very easily because there is such an option inside Share menu, called Copy. And on my $1K phone I don't have such an option.\r\n\r\nWTF?, Marcues Brownlee? I don't think that phone that costs $1K can even have the possibility to be compared with other smartphones but you gave this device the first position. It can't be compared even with iPhone SE. small screen device.\nPlease, I highly recommend you to make videos that compare the real user experience on a phones but not cameras, display and other shit that is almost same from phone to phone.\n\nMy iPhone SE has more value to performance ratio. Or not?  What do you think, Marcues Brownlee.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Alex Belka"}

No headphone jack (when a year ago they're mocking companies that do it), No wireless charging, No IP certification, and above-average (but not awesome) cameras, along side other features that make you shake your head in disbelief. \n\nHowever, when you consider everything else they've smacked into the device itself, you surprise yourself when asked about the price. \nOnePlus is no longer \"The Flagship Killer\" but instead continues to contest all the more expensive phones by putting top-of-the-line specs for nearly half the price. They now focused on providing great value for money whilst cutting as little corners as possible and is more customer-focused, providing the essentials the community wants while omitting those that they deem we can live without. \n\nThis is why it is the MVP of 2018.\n\nAwesome video, by the way!﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Kristopher Clemeno"}

Oh it has a better camera than ur oneplus 6t as well. Sorry to break it to u but MP in phone cameras really dont mean shit unless you have a camera bellow 8MP. Things like the sensor and image processing are much more important. If the mate 20 pro has a 40MP camera and the pixel has a 12.2MP camera by your logic the mate 20 should absolutely crush the pixel 3's camera. Also, if camera megapixels are soo important, why the hell does a company like samsung put lower MP cameras in flagships like the note 9 compared to midrange phones?? Also to add on, the XR has better battery life, better speakers than the oneplus 6t and will get updated for a longer time. Yeah the display I know its obviously worse than the oneplus 6t's display but the Xr has many other advantages. The oneplus 6t charges faster, but it has a glass back yet no wireless charge.... Assuming u use the oneplus 6t you probably think wireless charging is the dumbest shit ever that is useless, but once a company like apple implements it in their phones it is everywhere. People in the tech community have multiple wireless charges, and so do I and I simply can not use a phone without it. It also has no ip rating. You probably dont care about that too and if you decide to write back you will say how ohh do u use ur phone in the shower no one needs an ip rating etc... I am not saying that the XR is much better than the oneplus 6t, both phones do some things better than the other but don't just assume that the oneplus 6t is the best possible phone at that price range.

You think these people will be like I don't care about the money, I'll buy the double price, slower, last lesser battery performance, better looking, bigger screen, I got oneplus 6t 8 gb ram, oneplus 6t 20 megapixel rear and 16 mp front camera, Samsung 4 gb ram twice the price but twice less speed, camera twice lesser megapixel, oneplus 6t front camera having more megapixel than s9 main camera.﻿", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Tashi Lyrics"}

Twice ram is NOT twice performance like come on it doesnt take a genius to realize that.... The iPhone Xs Max is faster in speed tests (Phonebuff you can check) yet it has 4GB ram. There are phones with 12GB ram that suck. Second, I think I already said this but MP dont mean shit in phone cameras. U know which phone won best camera award - Pixel 3 and runner up - iPhone Xs. Yet both have lower MP than the op6t. I upgrade my phone every 3-4 years and I am willing to spend money if I know that what I get will last a long time. Its not called being a sheep its just called getting the best phone. If you take price out of consideration the note 9 is 100% a better phone than the op6t. And I am sorry but there are people who simply want the best. Mkbhd is the only significant youtuber who actually uses the op6t as his main phone. Go check videos where like 15 youtubers tell what phone they use as their main phone - none of them said op6t. They all picked note 9, mate 20 pro or the Xs Max. And all of them have access to any phone. If money is an issue then sure get the op6t its a great phone, but saying that its better than the note 9 is complete and utter bullshit.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Marko Veljanovski"}

When you have an iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod Or any of the other Apple products, then hell yes the iPhone is worth $1000. The market for accessories is also much more developed for iPhones. That lifestyle and that ease and joy of using apples technology together is what makes the iPhone worth it. I understand you need to compare apples to apples (no pun intended) and a phone should be able to stand on its own. If I had no other Apple product in my life, and none of my friends had iPhones for me to use iMessage and airdrop, and if I was looking at the iPhone in a box without considering the rest of the world (like fair comparisons should do) then obviously no I wouldn’t buy an iPhone and obviously I could find better value.

One on one tests have shown very little difference in performance between these two phones. By the way, Huawei's can be bought in places near the US so not having them available there is not a reason not to have one. As far as Huawei not being a friendly company, people say the same about Apple and Facebook, but continue using them. The struggle is all about 5G technology since China is more advanced stages than any US company.

Although it has high megapicel camera, it's not consistent. I clicked really beautiful pictures with rear camera but the front camera is somehow not that impressive coz it's so zoomed in and it's a let down during video calling. And the screen is really big but the The screen resolution is only upto 1080p so it's not that awesome display but its big and great to watch videos. Honestly I prefer the display details of s7 edge more over one plus 6t. The colors are little lighter and not so catchy to eyes. The battery is very impressive. It's full charge lasts more than nearly four s7 edge I believe. And that's my honest experience about it using it for 3 days.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Tashi Lyrics"}

Well also, there is discussions that xs max has best screen than note9, note9 might have bright screen but bright doesn't mean best. I guess note9 can only be proud of the s pen only as others don't have it. And for those who don't have enough money for extras. So not the best but good value for money okay.

Like the Red One camera, it is an evolving machine that gets better on nearly a weekly basis- and 99.9% of the population, like Marques, just want a phone that gets out of the way and works.\n\nThat said, the Red Hydrogen One is the only smartphone that was significant in any way this year (or the last 3 years?). If no other new phones had been released in 2018, it would have made pretty much zero difference to the user other than saving them a few bucks. The functionality of the Samsungs, Apples, Huaweis et al are basically rounding error improvements over last years models and all of them would not be missed if they had never been. Other than the \"Red Media Machine\", which I reiterate is not for most people, not one of those other phones really justify their existence outside of an excuse to get people to buy a new phone they don't really need.\n\nThat was the devil's advocate, the angel's advocate would say that the incremental improvements add up over time and while 2017 to 2018 is insignificant, the 2015 to 2018 was worthwhile, as will be the 2017 to 2020.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Clint Johnson"}

Remember that HTC U Ultra that got bashed early 2017 that phone even got updated to 8.0  Oreo faster than LG v20. I had the LG v20 when it first came out in October 2016 and all the way to August 2018, I was still on 7.0 nougat. I've heard that the LG v20 just a few months ago got the 8.0 update but by then I was already done with LG. The hTC U 11 and  12 are beast of smartphones there ain't nothing wrong with them smartphone and unlike LG, HTC actually is committed to updating their phones. With LG or samsung you got to wait damn near 6 months to a year or in my case two years before the v20 got an update. I didn't even get the 7.1 nougat update. I bought the LG v20 they talked it as the first phone on 7.0 nougat then it stayed on that until they finally updated it like in September or something by then I had got rid of it. I have an LG G6 as my backup phone it's okay but I rarely use it my main phone is my OnePlus 6t. Another thing LG does stupid things like you have the LG G4 with a 3000mah battery. Then when the LG G5 comes out you make the battery smaller 2,800mah battery with the LG G6 you put a 3,300mah battery in it then when LG come out with the LG G7 for some strange reason you go back to a 3000mah battery it literally makes no damn sense. That's what's keeping LG back just stupid stuff like that. There cameras are inconsistent they come up with a phone that got 3 cameras on it with this lg v40 and the cameras are okay at best meanwhile you got pixel who just got one damn camera and it blows out LG's cameras out of the water.﻿", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "MICOLE WHYTE #Oneplus6T"}
