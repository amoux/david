Unfortunately my son got used to it playing PUBG and wouldn't want my S2 as it does lagged (due to MIUI?).  Same brand, same chipset and GPU but just isn't optimised as well as the MiA1.  The MiA1 also gets Android updates faster than the S2, whilst the S2 been only getting MIUI updates and not full Android updates.\n\nI'm now looking for a new phone as I have taken up a new job assignment in another country.. due to travelling and the telco bandwidth available, I would need a phone with 5000mAh battery and 2600 band (4G) support.. anyone with a good recommendation for such a phone?﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "David Mah"}

I don’t think that many iPhone users are that rich to care enough about the consequences of wasting 1000+ just because they can. Most people are willing spend as much as they can if it means consistent and guaranteed user satisfaction. This is something I believe apple has exceptionally delivered to iOS users over the years. Bad customer experience doesn’t create such loyalty and retention that apple enjoys. That’s why year after year the iPhone outsells any single smartphone model. In your and my opinion, should anyone be charged a $1000 for a mobile phone? We both will say hell no. But we don’t get to decide what people are will to spend for their satisfaction. And oh hey, I caved and upgraded from my 7+ to the Xs max and it a wonderful experience. In spite of lower spec count iOS give me the experience and peace of mind I need. As much as I love my note 9 android is not well developed with the end user in mind. There are a lot to thinker with to get the way I want. To get it fully secure and reliable for my use I have to do a lot more. iOS is ready out of the box. And is consistent and not easily breakable.

I'd rather have an actual tablet with phone capabilities than the Note9. \n\nThe V40 jas the same size screen as the Note9, but it has 1/2 the bezel size of the Note9, and the V40 is more than 30% lighter. I had a Samsung Note4 that I liked a lot, and the Note7 (which I *LOVED*,) and was then moved back to the S7, which was a sad transition - I would have rather had the Note4 to go back to, but it wasn't being made anymore. I had to get off the S7, so I tried the LG V20 and really fell in love with the features. It wasnt as sleek as the Note7, but had very similar stats and no one was setting their houses on fire with it 😉.\n\nSamsung then did something I couldn't excuse. They talked me into keaving the V20 for the S8+, with the promise of a 256gb microSD card and the phone at 1/2 price because I was a Note7 user. Being on a jump lease program, I asked if I was eligible for the 1/2 price and was told yes, but then Samsung backpedaled and said that lease customers wouldn't get the discount. \n\nOnce again, Samsung talked me into leaving a phone I was happy with for a scenario I didn't like, and no way to go back to the old phone. \n\nWhen the V30 came out, amd my roommate already had the Note8, I wasn't thrilled with his Note8 and decided to do the LG thing again. \n\nEverything I liked about the V20 was back, but better. I upgraded to the V40 when the first price decrease came through, and the kease for my V40 is less per month than the V30 was. Although I thought the 5 cameras were a bit silly, Inuse a good deal of the camera features now. Just like the V20 and V30, the quad-DAC in the headphone jack is phenomenal! Of course, the 2 things soundwise that the V40 added pushed me to switching. \n\nThe boombox feature is fantastic! The bigger the item you sut the phone on, the deeper the bass, and it really can fill a room with that extra bass and not sound like a loud phone, and more like a large portable speaker. The second thing was the DTS-X sound that is available with or without the phone jack, so it really opens up the sound on my wireless headphones.\n\nI know there will be something pretty great about the V50 (and/or the V45 if they repeat last year.) Whether it could make me update the phone, we'll see. For now, the V40 isn't just the daily driver, but is the phone that is making me forget the Note7 was so fantastic. Kudos to LG - I wouldn't get any other brand phone now.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Kelly Abraham"}

Those 5 cameras along with all the video special effects makes this one of the most fun and functional devices to hit the scene in a long time. With the V50 right around the corner there should be some nice deals coming down the road. Aside from the camera and audio set up, this phone has a fast processor, decent battery life and a killer display. Its like the V20 on steroids and has become my daily driver.

{"cid": "Ugz5DgYsPPHEmJBY7nJ4AaABAg", "text": "Thank you for this overview, it is quite helpful. \nI can't but notice that you often come back to saying that the camera, \"while quite good, isn't the great\" or exceptional for your use. Many of us do like to have a really good camera, but maybe can't splash out on a Pixel 3 or Samsung S9 or maybe iPhone X, so if you arrange another set of \"favourite phones\" why don't you do a \"favourite camera phone\" or call it \"camera phone special\" and line up the phones that has a really really good camera from top phones and going down to what you think is \"acceptable\" for serious phone camera work, instagram or whatever your needs are as a \"social media beast\". \nBest would be if you did it in tiers, from the expensive £1000-£1500 mark (iPhones I guess) and the sub-1000 down to maybe £700-800, then around £500-mark down to bargain phones (are there bargain camera phones around £300-£400 that cuts it in your eyes?) and honourable mentions that might be good enough. Probably it is easier for you to sort them into tiers when you know the phones that is good enough and what price they are sold at currently. \nThough prices change quickly but I think all are aware of that. \nThere are probably drawbacks, but I certainly don't play games on my phones so if I can surf and use camera, maybe Instagram and other useful apps and the phone isn't hysterically laggy or needs rebooting four times a day to react to screen input (yes, I have it bad right now and desperately need a better everyday phone and daily clicker); I'm more than happy.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "N0rdman"}

I can't remember if this correct or not BUT I believe the \"downside\" of the Mix Mix 3 (in ASBYT's case Beautifying photos) isn't really a downside. You have to take into consideration that he has bought the CHINESE ROM EDITION, hence the features in it are targeted to the Asian market. If I am correct, I believe in the GLOBAL ROM VERSION the beauty mode within the camera can be disabled COMPLETELY unlike the Chinese ROM. \nJust know that if you do buy this phone, most will be Chinese ROM version with a flashed Global ROM. Official global variant for Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is available in Hong Kong via Xiaomi's Hong Kong Website. Global variant comes only with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage though, not like the selection Xiaomi offers to China with 8GB and 10GB RAM variants with 256GB Storage.\n\nAlso be sure to note if you want a global version, make sure the box in the front has \"MI\" branded in a shiny logo on the middle of the box, whereas Chinese Version says \"MIX\" , just like ASBYT's one (check his unboxing for the phone).\n\nOther than that little hiccup, the phone is solid as ASBYT says.﻿", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "The Humble Bao"}

In fact, Xiaomi products are known for offering somewhat premium and durable products, at an affordable price point. \nLook at how OnePlus made a name for themselves. Their phone on launch was the OnePlus One, offering (at the time) TOP NOTCH, PREMIUM SPECS AND A DURABLE BUILD for prices of the Pocophone F1, if not cheaper. Till this day, people are rocking the original OnePlus One with no problem at all (apart from software because no more updates, and everything else is outdated). And now look at OnePlus. They've made a reputation for themselves that they can produce high quality, durable, premium smartphones for an affordable price. So much so that they can even increase the price of the phones they create each year and still have MORE people purchase them without hesitation. \nSo my point is, you can produce a quality smartphone with top of the line specs, amazing hardware and premium features yet not have to worry about it faulting you in the long run, all for an affordable price.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "The Humble Bao"}

{"cid": "UgznOHg7ofk57yqtsGx4AaABAg.8pF-GF2qHbP8pHd7ryKFvX", "text": "@Clint Curtis  This is just my experiences... \nPrior to purchasing the Pixel 3 XL I went from the iPhone 6s to the XS Max.. I need an additional phone for travel and instead of using the old 6S I've decided to try Android.\nFirst out of the box it feels great the Pixel 3 XL it's light and the frosted back is actually an nice addition at first.\nAfter turning it on, the very first thing that is out there is the notch, now the XS Max has an notch too but this one is in comparison really in the way, although I've set my peace with the notch during the 10 days I had the thing it was always there being slightly annoying.\nSecond thing is the chin... and instantly I felt not amazed by the design but rather annoyed.. I find the decision to accomodate stereo speakers for the price of an chin too much, and rather you see many other manufactures towards the end of 2018 going full bezel less rather than going back 3 years in design. But that is all very subjective.\nThen I've figured that if you hold the XS Max next to the Pixel 3 XL the display of the pixel isn't as vibrant also it lacks in brightness, living in Australia where the sun is always out and you sent most of the time outside rather than inside, a lack of brightness isn't really helping.\nAlso it has the blue hue something that is common in OLED displays... So in terms of hardware and how I feel about it isn't promising.\nThen the UI, Gestures isn't even close to IOS, and I shouldn't compare but knowing how it can work this is a bit disappointing... \nThe microphone then, I don't like to make phone calls but the ones I do make are very important for my business, and this is the first very big problem, is the just plain awful microphone, some say they will update the software for it in the update in December... but then I was thinking..I paid $1349 Aussie dollars for it, and how on earth is the microphone on an phone bad?! They should just stick in an better component mic in it that is possibly more expensive but just works fine... You can't cut corners on the fundamental functions of an phone.\nThen there was the ram management... It's all smooth but when I run an native app such as chrome or maps combined with Spotify, it crashed every time.. I got pulled over by the cops after maps chrashed and need to know where to go and the cops noticed I was driving a bit weird...  and that is every single day I have either maps running or chrome and Spotify is playing.. how are native apps just crashing, if it was 3rd party app I could understand, but this is google's very own OS clean, stock android no bloatware and this happens?! Unacceptable..\nScreenshots takes seconds to save as well as photos...\n\nBattery then... 5 hours on screen time was very hard to achieve, also because the brightness of the screen is 100% most of the day.\nLater I found out the data usage was quite substantial...although I haven't been doing noticeably different use of the phone. So it has been downloading tons of data I didn't ask for, or it has been uploading my data continuously.... goddamn Google!\nWireless charging is painfully slow... I have an belkin wireless charger and it charge the XS Max just fine but the Pixel 3 XL very very slow. \nLater I learned that fast wireless charging is enabled for the google pixel stand.\n\n\nAnd I thought Apple was playing dirty... well turns out Google knows the game all too well. \n\nI can keep going but that would be mostly software and my lack of understanding android.\n\nI want an phone out of the box that is stunning to behold and every time  I hold the phone I can see it why it is so expensive. And I don't have that instead I felt I've paid too much for the product Google gave me, it certainly doesn't feel like its worth the price... Having said that the XS Max was much more expensive but feels solid... I'll be using the XS max definitely for the next 3 years or more.\n\nSO I returned it and got the OnePlus 6T﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Stephen Wouw"}

Bring it on...\nIn wish there was a way to fully integrate the 6T into my Apple ecosystem... But I'm afraid that's never going to happen... And the for the price I'm smiling all the way every time I use it... And I guess that's what's it all about.\nAnd having 6 GB it makes everything just a bit more smooth, and it just leave me thinking why can't Google do the same? Anyway I'm super happy with both phones... I'm good now for at least the next 3 years.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Stephen Wouw"}

I do like it, but it doesn't look, perform of feel as good as iOS in day to day use. I still use my 6s plus on the hotspot for things like imessage and a good bit of social media apps because of how much better they look and feel on iOS. That said, I don't hate the Note but it could use some work imo. Hoping the new OS (which looks a lot like iOS) on the 15th brings it together for me. The gestures and overall less clunky look should really help. All that said, my main issue with the note is the camera. I can not get the \"blur\" to go away. Photos come out much cleaner on the 4 gen old 6s plus, which is truly a bummer. Any tips on how I can get the best out of the camera? Would also prefer not having to download some third party app to do so.... I feel like I need to download an app for every little thing on android just to make the phone UI useable. Don't like that either....imo, a \"super flagship\" should have a clean and seamless UI out of the box. Hate the keyboard too tbh and went to download the highly recommended Swiftkey and the first thing the app told me is it would keep records of ALL of my conversations and keyboard inpit... gonna be a no from me. Anyway, would love some help with the camera cause at this point I am barely using it. Stuck with this thing for at least a year...
