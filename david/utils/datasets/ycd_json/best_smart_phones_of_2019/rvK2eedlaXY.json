Underscreen fingerprint scanner is faster than Mate 20 Pro, and as fast as my 1+6T. Telephoto never been my thing so 3X optical zoom for me is more than enough.

Like too many other YT reviewers, you seem too biased toward both Samsung and Apple and possibly Pixel. Aside from the propensity to favour OEMs that dominate sales and merely because they provide free devices and merchandise, you also 2. Denigrate Smartphones from Manufacturers that make revered devices like LG (this time their G8) which you go out of your way to exhort viewers not to buy. In the case of the G8, at as low as $620US from T-Mobile, this devices checks boxes left unchecked by all of your other choices in the Top 15, including 2 Year Warranty,  Unparalleled Audio via headphones, best-in-class voice call reception and camera interface which allows for manual control that potentially outdoes image quality of the rest except Zoom on P30Pro. Add to that its snazzy colours, smooth rear-mounted cameras and performace that no lay person will be able to distinguish from the S10s and Huaweis. I have news for you. The unwashed, totally novice Smartphone buyer has little interest in your tech site. The rest of us who are fanatics or such deserve the type of impartiality that Reviewers who spend their own money tend to provide (the Flossy Carters and Juan B's of YouTube world).

I've recently notice  that besides no marketing for their  devices secondly reviewers are to blame for the the way in which the public perceives a device. Its impossible to compare budget smartphones to top ones and although lg dosen't have the best camera performance in auto it kills it in the manual settings and the  display isn't bad if not almost comparable to the l8kes off samsung so to to public  be wise buy a phone that you feels grate for you,not some one else preference because all smart phone has gimmicks and all have their short fall, but reviewers  high light it on the brands they naturally don't like because off what the prefer. But as it Is lg g8 is a grate smartphone it dose a lot off things better than the s10 and s10plus manny fear the boot loop issue from six or five years ago but for some reason forgets samsung suffers from battery swelling in devices or burning phones, so as i was saying take what reviewers say with a grain of salt its no longer a fair unbiased system it now about self preference or brand bashing, so the choice is yours as the public.   thank you.﻿", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "daniel joseph"}

And don't even think about playing games on iPhones, although they are very powerful, the power contributes into generating more heat into your device if you use processor intensive apps, especially games. There's also no liquid cooling in it, and the stainless steel frame does not dissipate heat greatly, and after just a couple months of gaming with your iPhone, I can bet you will be in the line of Apple's repair centre.

In another test, the guy said they were about the same, but showed that the battery life wasn't as good on the Exynos.
