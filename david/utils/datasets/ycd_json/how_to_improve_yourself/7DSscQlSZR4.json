It never works out in your favor paying anything off. I am still well ahead of my peers due to the fact that I do not lease anything that I can buy cash. For example the previous car I bought new I only lost 40k on in 4 years, meaning the car cost me 10k per year, the avg monthly installment is 5k per month for my car. So in buying this car cash, I effectively only paid 8 installments over 4 years vs paying an installment every month for 4 years = (48 installments) Thats a huge saving of 40 installments which I could put towards my next car.

I also read and meditate but running is the one habit that makes all the difference and makes everything else that I do less of a burden.  If I only read or only meditate I just don't get the same benefits, but if I run then this permeates in very positive ways through the rest of my life.  The result is that meditation and reading seem easier and more natural to do.  For me meditation/reading do not make me more motivated to run.  In any case I am not knocking meditation or reading.  Added in with the running meditation and reading definitely make me much more emotionally strong.  \n\nThere have been a couple of times where I have injured myself as a runner so I have to be careful in the future to maintain strength and flexibility.  In the past I've only focused on running but this time around I'm including the strength training and stretching to support the running.  It will become even more important as I get older.  This is not a 21 day habit, nor something I would just do for a year and then just stop.  It really is a habit that needs to be maintained throughout your life.   It sounds painful and overwhelming in the beginning to think that far ahead since we are so used to getting our fix without having to wait but over time you complain less and less about it and really start to see how your whole mindset shifts and you realize the putting in the effort is very much worth it.  You do get the feeling that brighter days are ahead and that even if dark days do come you'll have the strength to deal with them.Ôªø", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "meropale"}

Once you pick up the habit, you will now have some knowledge or motivation to meditate or exercise. Starting the next one would be easy. You'll be picking 2 habits at once. One result that's likely to happen is you finish reading to apply. HENCE, doing two of these habits at once ;)\n\nAnother thing that would make your life great is waking up 2 hours earlier. In these 2 hours you can do all of the 3 habits. Say you'd read 25 pages, meditate for 15 min and exercise for 20 min with 10 warm up. You will feel productive and great to have a great start of the day ;)\nWaking up early is the mother habits, if you mastered it your life will tremendously change.  \nBut for starter, try the first trick for a week or two, then try waking up early to read alone. Once you pick up reading, add meditation and fitness to the early routine. Trust me, your life will change. Be smart ;)Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Meow"}

I personally go for cheaper and older models though. I would need to see the math on it I guess, as I only paid 1500 for an 10-12 year old car that works just fine. Any problems I have I end up using it to practice mechanic skills because I know I can trash it and buy a new one in two weeks if push comes to shove.\n\nI'm going to try for the meditation habit. I believe it would be the central habit that I need to really push me into doing what I intend on accomplishing. It also aligns with my weaknesses as a fleshed out person, as my spiritual and inner peace are by far my weakest pillars. And since meditation aligns with my spiritual needs, I believe it provide the largest impact on my life of the options set before me in this video.\n\nThanks for the video man!Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "MrLastlived"}

I've read well over a thousand books by now (which is not that impressive once you realize that I read about 100 books each year) and if there's one thing that I can tell you it's that philosophical literature has had the biggest impact on my world view. Those are the real gems.... things that can't just be taught in courses. People have to actually develop themselves to the point where they are willing to do work in order to obtain knowledge. Watching a video is the easiest thing in the world. It's akin to junk food. Reading a book on the other hand is an ergodic activity. One has to wrap his mind around concepts and create mental images of their own instead of watching another persons animations.

Since Vipassana I quite smoking and drinking effortlessly, my willpower, focus and hapinness increased significantly. But i still occasionally do binge on porn. It goes like that: I have a streak of productive days and  then I masturbate and it triggers a binge of porn, masturbation, mindless internet surfing and slacking in general which takes around 1-2 days. This is one of this days. QUESTION: Can I add new habit? (Reading, probably) My meditation isn't still habitual. I think that i need to add reading because: meditation didn't purge porn already AND reading is actually fun (especially comparing to medidation) AND I could do that everytime I feel triggered to watch porn.

You either must turn the car into the dealer (where they try to convince you to trade up to a new lease) or you must purchase the car at the end of the lease. There are also hidden fees associated with leasing a car. Often the mileage limits are difficult to stay under, and you may find yourself paying over mileage charges at the end of your lease.

You also don't have to worry about repairs.\n\nBuying used is often less expensive than both options assuming you can maintain a car. \n\nIf you buy new and keep forever then you could save money buying used then keeping forever.

Not everyone has the same needs and habits as you do. Leasing a car works perfectly for those who want, and can afford, to drive the newest cars. See, for me leasing a car would be perfect if I didn't like to drive long distances multiple times a year. If all I did was commute to work day in and day out, then there would be no reason not to lease a car.\nAlso, owning a home is a stupid idea FOR ME because it goes against my current goal of living free and not being tied down to anything. At least, not yet. When I'm older and ready to settle down, I will definitely buy a home to live in. For now, the only properties I'll be buying are ones I intend to rent out.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Damian Rivas"}

When you buy a car, ITS YOURS. THAT IS YOUR LEGAL PROPERTY. A lease is essentially renting a car for two years with extreme restrictions. That, combined with the offhand comment that history is useless in every day life (when it has literally shaped our present and will continue to shape our future, and presents outliers for what's to come) makes me question the rest of this advice. This all just seems very elementary and poorly presented.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Andy Dietrich"}

What is the financial value of something being \"your own legal property\"? Zero. You have to look at this from a financial point of view. Leasing a car is usually less expensive than buying new then reselling every x years. Just like renting a place to live can be more financially beneficial than buying one.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Yann Larriau"}

I don‚Äòt understand why they allow that, but I had such a situation a few weeks ago.\nAlso, you can lease a car for 3 years, return it and lease the next car, a newer model for 3 years. I prefer having the newest model over an old, ugly pile of junk any day of the week.\nI think there is hardly anyone who doesn‚Äòt want another car or the newer model of his current car after 3-4 years of owning it.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "TDFXX"}

Owning a car, and having it as \"legal property\" means you control the title, and once it's paid off it's paid off. It's capital. The second you lease a car, all it's doing is depreciating. I personally don't know anyone that does or would \"buy a car every few years\". I have a car from 1981 that is perfectly operational - so that's a moot point. Owning a car gives you capital whereas continuously leasing is just a liability. If your cash flow changes due to extraneous situations, that lease will be a further burden just for having means of transposition. I made my first six figures at 24 but what do I know.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Andy Dietrich"}

Four years and 11 months of it I haven't paid attention to that and the last two years were just horrible. I had headache and I had no energy for anything. Whenever I came home from school (about 2-3pm) I ate something and right after that i fell asleep because as I said I had no energy for doing anything. I had also problems by sleeping at night but I anyways slept about six hours at night plus three hours when I came home after school. So I slept so much but I was anyways tired and sleepy all the day. One week ago I started becoming more healthy and to not eat any lactose products or any fructose products and if you believe or not I feel so much better and I'm not tired anymore just by paying attention to my diet. I don't sleep in the afternoon anymore and also when I have only six hours of sleep. Also I feel so happy, healthy, fit and energised for the day. Not to forget: I am more concentrated on things like when I study or even talk to someone.

Well after done with payment you could potentially have 6 years of 3-6k annual investment contribution using a 8% average rate of return(given you're young and can full equity exposure) you can potentially have 23-47k over a 6 year time frame. Thats a great return on investment rather than leasing a car for the same 6 year THorizon.

Now I'm planning to choose meditation as my keystone habit to adopt using your tamed course, but does that mean I shouldn't read or run every once in a while or try not to regularize my reading and running? thanks.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Rose A."}

The reason the person quit smoking was not self motivation, but external motivation. The most important habit is surrounding myself with people who already do what I want to be doing. Because humans are mimetic creatures / social learners we copy the habits of our surroundings. This makes it much easier to adopt new or change old habits. \n\nIt's why your example suddenly was into fitness and diet, it's also why fat people have fat friends. Reading works exactly that way. It exposes me / my brain to behaviors that can be mimicked. Same goes for video by the way. I can also listen to podcasts. As long as I am paying attention the medium doesn't matter too much.\n\nFitness is the same thing. Nobody eats healthy because they do fitness.

Read about subjects that interest you, that you feel you need to know, and that challenge you in some way. Always be mindful when reading for the best results. If you do stick to fiction then I suggest reading consecutively harder to read books with higher levels of language so you at least get wordier :p Picking up writing as a hobby would justify it greatly though. I'm a writer and a game designer, so I read and play games all the time. But I read and play with a critical eye and ensure that I don't merely waste my time with nothing to show for it.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Empress Lithia"}

I want to focus on developing the habit in fitness, only problem is that my work schedule can sometimes be all over the place because of the industry I work in, which is on big production films and TV shows. So what I would like to know is how should I go about building this habit? I always thought when it came to working out, that it had to be done at a certain time of day or done at the same time each day and with this hectic schedule that just seems near impossible. I know that I could probably choose one of the other two habits listed but fitness in my opinion is something I need right now due to my very low energy levels & poor eating habits, it's not like I'm obese or anything, hell I'm not even overweight, but im 24 years old and I feel that I should be operating at optimal capacity, but honestly I feel like an old man who barely can get out of bed in the mornings and it sucks. So do you have any advice?Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Trashbagwilly"}

Just get the habit of being active started, you can refine it later. It is much easier to keep a habit if it‚Äôs at the same time each day because the time of day acts as a reminder or trigger. But you might be able to use something else as a reminder. For me I have only one rule for fitness - I must put my running shoes on after work. That‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs a stupidly simple goal but it works like this - If I don‚Äôt feel active after work I will put my shoes on and then feel like I have completed my goal. I allow myself to not feel bad if I don‚Äôt go work out. That‚Äôs very important. Here‚Äôs the secret though. Nearly every time I put my shoes on, even if I feel terrible, I‚Äôll walk down to the park anyway. Then nearly every time I‚Äôll go for a run or do a calisthenics work out. I‚Äôm pretty much tricking myself into working out and doing something. Even a short half arsed workout is better than not leaving the house. I‚Äôve been doing this for a couple of years now and I have easily made it into a habit that I enjoy. I look and feel great and I‚Äôve found activities that I love and fit well into my lifestyle.

Entonces vas a casa o si puedes en tu gimnasio o no se , en el parque puede ser si lo haces al aire libre. Entonces en ese estado donde el cuerpo necesita estar relajado y descansar. Aprovechas a sentarte un momento a solas, un lugar donde no te molesten por al menos unos 10 minutos y te sientas comodamente pero con Atencion y Alerta, sin DORMIRTE, pues no se trata de dormirse.\nUna vez elijas el lugar y el momento, simplemente te sientas comodamente solo, sin distracciones de ningun tipo, de preferencia cierras los ojos y lo mas probable es que empezara a sonar la famosa \"vocecita\" en tu cabeza que te empezara a \"hablar\" de todo (Pasado ,presente y futuro)lo que no has hecho, etc.\nEntonces esos pensamientos que surgen, tu los ves , sin criticarlos, sin aferrarte a ellos. Igual como cuando vas al cine y ves una pelicula. Estas sentado viendo un film y solo eres un testigo de lo que acontece en la pantalla. Igual, es lo que pasara cuando estes sentado en silencio y entonces solo permanece como un testigo nada mas. Y asi lo que dure y decidas sentarte. \nDespues de esto, de ver tu propia pelicula ,sin haberla criticado, sin poner nigun comentario, etc. entonces sigues tu vida normal.\nPoco a poco si lo practicas, esta interiorizacion te ira dando mas y mas respuestas sobre preguntas que siempre has tenido.\n\nLos libros, pues lee los temas que te atraigan. Dedica un dia a visitar una buena libreria y dedica un tiempo adecuado sin prisa y tension a ver las estanterias y te puedo asegurar que al leer algunos, encontraras el adecuado, y esto sucede asi porque de manera muy extra√±a, suele ser \"El libro quien llama al lector\".Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "mecanicien37"}

Any system can be improved; and the system through which we educate our students can be improved. At the same time, the things we learn in school provide a basic foundation upon which all the other knowledge we acquire later in life is built. The lessons we learn later in life needs something to stand on when it enters our brains and that \"formal\" education provides that.\n\nPerhaps we should not sell students on the idea that their education is complete once they finish school. There's no way any of us can know with absolute certainty all that we'll need to know later in life.\n\nIf there was a tweak I'd make to the education system, it would be placing an emphasis on how to learn. In this way, when students leave the \"formal\" education system, they have an understanding that they are now taking over the responsibility of educating themselves because there's no way that any school system could ever teach all that needs to be known. \n\nStudents need to really grasp that what they're receiving is a foundation that will assist in the assimilation of everything else they'll learn over their lifetime.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sherri James"}

I wanted to recommend you three books I loved: \n\n1. \"Amador\" by the spanish philosopher Fernando Savater. He wrote it for his 15 year old son. \n\n2. \"Wide Awake : A Budhist Guide for Teens\" by Diana Winston. She is a wonderful meditation teacher. I once watched a lesson on meditation from Yale University on youtube and the professor recommended her guided meditation podcasts. To find them just search for: \n\"UCLA Hammer Meditation\" on Itunes.\n\n3.  Let me tell you a story by Jorge Bucay. He is a very beloved Argenitinian psychologist. In the book he has this teenaged patient and for every problem he tells during the sessions, Jorge Bucay tells him a very interesting story , related to that problem. That's the kind of book you would finish in one day and  never forget! \nBest wishes :- )Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lua Veli"}

When I am in the process of changing my relationship with my thoughts, I change my relationship with reality. I can navigate thoughts with more awareness, clarity and understanding as I journey through meditation.
