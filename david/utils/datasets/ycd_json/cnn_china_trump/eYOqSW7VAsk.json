{"cid": "Ugit__bHBRS3vXgCoAEC.8FsLtbWWKuz8GBiM30mKLC", "text": "@nathan osgood I'm upset of the following turn of events too. Do you see me swearing?\n\nUK does have its own points based immigration system, and those rules apply to me as a commonwealth citizen. These rules are more onerous than the aussie style; so when applied to EU citizens, we will see a huge drop in numbers due to the min salary requirement for work visa approval. With regards to high numbers from non-EU, that's not a problem at all. If you analyse the numbers that came in as at end of March 2016 from the ONS website, 170k are on student visas, the largest portion of non-EU immigration. Overseas students are good because they pay the full tuition fees of about £18k pa; so for a typical 3 year course + expenses, each would bring in about £80k. Total £13bn into UK economy. About 90k came in on a work visa and this is now capped due to uncontrolled flow from EU. The main difference between non-EU and EU migrants is that non-EU migrants cannot claim welfare benefits and once their visas have expired, they have to leave the country. To get indefinite leave to remain, there will be another set of rules. Back to main issue, mass migration from EU needs to stop.﻿\nThe UK immigration system is very discriminatory and not many remainers realise this or even care to be honest. So it's laughable when they accuse those who voted leave as racist or xenophobic without knowing how non EU migrants are treated. If anything I would say a remain vote is an endorsement for discrimination. The min salary requirement varies depending on jobs, the gov approved list of shortage jobs will state how much for each occupation. \n\nMost of the immigration from the commonwealth are students paying twice the amount of tuition fees that Europeans pay but don't have to pay because the British government loans them since they're Europeans, are kicked out after their education. The statistics are laughable for the non eu. Most of them don't stay. Also the new rules made in April that doesn't let common wealth students extend their visa for an optional placement, masters and the 35000 annual salary all give eu students and workers an edge in the competition which is unfair considering they can clean toilets and stay back and the UK is losing potential engineers and doctors﻿. All of the point system and the regulations are compromised for eu citizens most of whom don't move for high skill contribution and now eu citizens have an unfair edge since they could do the optional placement between years in their bachelors and integrated courses which were previously promised to commonwealth citizens too. 12500 and 19500, pounds and etc are huge money man compared to 9000 pounds a year. And most of them are hard earned and loaned money from their home countries that people have committed to come and study and work here unlike freebie Europeans most of whom don't even like the English culture. Personal experiences mate ﻿\n\nThe £35k salary is the requirement for indefinite leave to remain application after 5 years of staying in UK legally. Many find this criteria hard to fulfil. The minimum salary for a work visa stands somewhere at 24000 pounds mate. Europeans can earn like 11000 pounds a year non taxable self employed salary and apply for settlement. I have done my fair share of research unlike most young remainers who feel broken because they can't go tour Europe without a visa. most of the people benefiting from the eu are not even regular people but businesses and Westminster﻿.  not many people can earn over 20000 pounds for a work visa or 35000 pounds for a settlement. this is racism and discrimination\n\nAny system is better than no system which is what the EU citizens are enjoying at the moment, freedom to live/work with no restrictions. The argument that an immigration system imposed on EU citizens will not have any impact is nonsense, i hope they come up with a system which will be fair and treat all immigrants equally.﻿", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "MetalGod 1990"}

{"cid": "UgjJaFJckF12J3gCoAEC.8FqscnBxHq18Fs_2deCOZj", "text": "If I may, I have a theory as to why Boris has refused to run for party leader/PM. Thought I'd mention it since you mentioned him in passing.\n\nIf you look at his writings from back in the day when he was merely a journalist, you'd notice that not one of his works contains any hint even of euro-scepticism, let alone of any desire for this new 'independence'. If you look at how his 'outside of the EU' hopes for Britain are essentially to remain in the free market, to do nothing to immigration, blah blah blah. The only conclusion one could possibly come to is that he's not as behind the Brexit vote as he would want the public to think.\n\nSo why join it, you may ask? Well, Boris studied Classics at Oxford (at my college, Balliol, actually). So it's safe to say he's very familiar with how Augustus, first emperor of Rome, changed the state from a steadfast Republic into a pseudo-Monarchy, seemingly without anyone noticing. How did Augustus do it? To put it simply, he presented himself as the rebel against a status quo which, in the eyes of many, was a failing system (sound familiar?). He placed himself as the voice of reason, or so the sources written after his reign record, among a rabble of infighting and protracted bureaucracy (sound familiar?). He presented himself as the reluctant leader, forced into service for his country not out of ambition, but out of duty (sound familiar?). Think of Cinncinatus, the dictator of Rome in 390 BC who took on the dictatorship for three days, solved the crisis, and gave up power, returning to his humble farm - the reluctant but dutiful leader.\n\nI believe that boris is attempting something similar. He's the voice of reason against Farage and Gove's trigger happiness, he's the voice of reason against the EU which 52% of the population apparently doesn't want (that's another discussion for another time). And yet he didn't step up as an ambitious politician when Cameron fell: he's the reluctant leader.\n\nSo, what next? Well, whoever inherits Cameron's position to tide us over until the next General Election will, or certainly greatly risks, inheriting a climate of economic depression, and certainly will inherit the monumental task of successfully triggering Article 50 and negotiations. The most likely outcome is that the 'caretaker Prime Minister' will be seen as a failure, and will resign as leader when a new election comes around. Much like Gordon Brown, though he rather mucked things up for himself.\n\nBoris doesn't want that. After all, he's the supreme careerist, joining the side of the most important UK decision in over a decade he disagrees with just to get the headlines and exposure he wants. No, Boris will, throughout the period in office of Theresa May, or Michael Gove, or whoever it ends up being, will be the anti-PM. He will once again be the voice of reason, but this time against a PM who in most minds will be a failure, rather than Farage.\n\nThen, when the next leader of the Tories resigns or whatever, he will be ripe for the takeover before a new General Election. When all the worry of being perceived as a failure following the referendum will be gone, he will be able to be the successful successor to the failed caretaker.\n\nBut those are just my two cents.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "hughtubecube"}

If we can't come in then you can't come in either. Don't you even think that we will let you move freely in Europe. Nobody, not even the Americans can do that. You will be treated the same as Canadian or an American. You will have a \"favourable\" trade deal, but not the same free access to the single market,  but not unrestricted access. And if you ever think of getting retired in Spain then think twice because non EU rules would apply to you. Any non EU citizen wanting to retire in Spain and most EU countries must buy a property in that country AND have at least €200,000 cash in a bank account in that country. You also need to have a monthly pension of €50K per year, in Spain is €35K per year, you need to have private health insurance and you are not allowed to have access to pubic services. Does a Middle class Brit receives between €35K and €50K in pension per year, plus €200K cash in the bank plus cash in hand to buy property(because you can't rent)? This is why you only see wealthy Russians and non EU pensioners living in Europe. Oh! and forget about keeping your EU banking passport which made you the global financial centre. You will have to trade with the rest of the world and have no banking preferential access to the EU which is the backbone of your economy. France and Ireland will get that gig now.

If the Article 50 is triggered now, the pound sterling will fall flat again. I didn't vote because am not into politics but my girlfriend did, the main reason for the leave campaign winning, was to take control of our borders in order to minimise immigration. Am residing in Norwich, 95% of the people over here voted for leave. ''We want all the polish people out of here, Our country is flooded with immigrants and now we don't even know ourselves'' that was the mouthpiece of the people over here. They weren't even talking about the money we send to EU or the poor performance of the European economies. The main objective for the Leavers campaign was IMMIGRATION, they targeted the problems people are facing because of over crowded immigrants which is housing, working, health and security. You heard D. Cameron telling the EU leaders '' i lost the referendum due to Europe's freedom of movement rules, there was a very great concern about the movement of people and immigration'' So i don't know why you said ''IT WASN'T ALL ABOUT IMMIGRATION''.. of course it was about immigration.

When Article 50 is implemented the pound will probably fall again.  That is to be expected.  However, once full control is back in the UK's hands and starts trading under their own control the pound will rebound to higher levels.  It will happen.  Just as it did prior to ever joining the EU.  Just like other nations under their own control the UK markets will have up's and down's.  But the UK will be in control of it all and the UK will no longer be paying the EU the vast amounts of money they currently do.  Not to mention all the BS regulations you currently have to endure.  Now, I do agree that immigration was a big issue but it was certainly not the only issue.  There were other issues and everyone knows it.  Some people are trying to paint citizens of the UK as racist for voting out.  There is NO WAY that you or anyone else will ever convince me that most UK citizens are racist.

It's just a democracy of a larger amount of people than the UK, just as everyone in the UK is ruled by a government which cannot represent everyone's will perfectly so the EU can't represent all of the populations will perfectly.\n\nFarage was a member of the fisheries committee of the European parliament, he complains about EU fisheries policy yet he attended just one of the 42 meetings while he has been a member. Farage had some power which could have used to push his complaints but he didn't.\n\nHe is a dishonest man who overstates how much we give to the EU (far less than £350 million a week) over exaggerates how much of the laws that apply to us are made there (and even if there were more it is still democratic). Lies about the impact of immigrants on the economy, EU immigrants pay more in tax than they take in benefits, they do not increase unemployment or reduce wages of people already living in the country (if you don't believe me on any of these just do a quick search in google scholar, there are many studies). \n\nHe has whipped up a storm of misplaced xenophobic anger. The problems people face today have been incorrectly blames on immigrants and it is unfair and frankly nasty.\n\nBrexit will ruin London as a financial centre, without passporting into Europe London will no longer have quite the attraction to financial companies that it does now.

Some people can't possible perceive of someone having a different opinion to them, and if they do it must be because they are evil or biggoted in some way.\n\nI have a mix of friends, some voted to leave, some to stay but we all sit round, share a beer or two, and discuss calmly together how we voted and why, and there is no reason strangers can do it too.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Michael Bashford"}

You might be older than me, I neither know nor care, nor is it particularly relevant. For the record I was born in the 50's.I have read the article you posted and it gave me no insights that would make me change my view on Brexit (Leave).\"Playing the race card\" was an old ploy a long time ago. Not everyone who wants an end to uncontrolled immigration is a racist, some, like myself, happen to live in areas where the local immigrant population is rapidly overwhelming services that were not designed to cope with the recent influx of migrants. Yes, these shortages can be overcome with a suitable hiatus to enable the extra people to be catered to. That is not happening at the present as more and more migrants arrive daily. I am positive that the majority of these migrants are NOT being located in the leafy suburbs but in the cities and large conurbations. Not really surprised that many \"middle class\" Brits say they see no problem with excess immigration...how else will they get cleaners/nannies etc?Also the article you mention leans heavily on the \"fear factor\" being pursued by Brexit over uncontrolled immigration. It fails to take notice of the fear of economic collapse that came from the remain camp.Yes, sterling dropped in the immediate aftermath, as did the FTSE.Both of these have recovered most of the losses in days, let alone giving it months or years.People have stated that the EU is huge and can crush the UK with trade tariffs. It is almost as if the rest of the world, China, USA, Australia, Africa would not embrace better trade deals with an Independent UK able to negotiate better rates for both parties.Lastly, in my opinion the single most over riding reason Brits voted for Leave was that they no longer wanted people they don't know and haven't voted for dictating the way our country is run!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "tony AC"}

I am not going to speak about Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, ... because I don't have so much knowledge about it and feel it might have been handled the wrong way. Germany's immigrant problem isn't directly caused by the EU, because Merkel 'invited' them to Germany.

Surprise, you'll still have to follow them if you want to trade with the EU, look at finland and switzerland, it even gets worse, you don't have a voice anymore when rules are made or changed . No more money to EU? Again look at finland and switzerland, they pay the EU for the privilege to trade. No more free movement of persons? Again it will still be in a trade agreement if the EU makes the same agreement as with other non EU european nations. \n\nSo what do you actually gain?\n\nIs the EU perfect? No. Does it have to change? yes. Can it? yes, if not now than when this 'brainwashed' young people really get in. These young people have an image of the EU in their head that's good. We know things need to change, and we will. EU is the future, no european nation on it's own has much power in the world politically and economically. The problem now is that there has been too much expansion in too little time. It might take a while to resolve the problems caused by this, but we will. And if not we'll just have to make it smaller, back to the basics, meaning western/south european countries and germany.

Ofcourse the EU can't function if they are in charge, they don't wish to do what's good for the entire EU, but only for what is good for themselves/their countries. The eastern countries are a perfect example. If money is being distributed, they are first in line, when refugees needs to be located they oppose it harsly. The EU parliament needs more power about certain subjects. For example the environment, energy, ... these things can better be organised on EU level than national level. This is where they should start. Together with better refugee policy, outer border security and inner security (like EU FBI/intelligence). This are things they should focus on most now and where the EP should have much more powers.\n\nSomething I believe personally a lot in, but shouldn't be on EU level is a shared military of western european countries (Belgium, Netherlands, UK, france, Germany, perhaps Italy and spain too.) Reports state that this could reduce costs treefold while still keeping the same strength. Of course nationalist will be highly opposed to this idea, but I believe this is the future. What are the reason not to? independence? No one wants a new war between (western) european states, so the military should never be used for independence reasons. Risk of one country taking power? Rules need to be put into place obviously to stop something from happening. Leadership? Still ranks, even now with joined operation rank superceeds nationality (or so it should be). Language? English, most spoken language looked at all fields (internet, air, science, worldwide exposure, ...).\n\nI know this might be really farfetched future talk.

That's merely how the left wing dominated media has portrayed him. (doesn't mean I trust him, but the loony left does need to be counterbalanced) He is in favour of a points based immigration system which is identical to that being used very successfully elsewhere in the world. It's already almost impossible to emigrate from Britain to anywhere outside Europe, the USA notably. And getting a job anywhere in Europe is almost impossible despite the \"rules\" of the EU. We're one of the only countries in the EU that actually worked within those rules anyway. Unless you were transfered within a company. \nThe main message that Farage has tried to get across though, must be heard. The EU is a federal political union. A wholly unelected government. That's not what people signed up for. And we definitely did not sign up to having all our production industries shut down and moved to mainland Europe because the money we paid in was being used to subsidise our competition on eastern Europe. We didn't sign up to having to work some of the longest hours, for the lowest pay in the world while the French, German and Italians enjoyed the exact opposite. We didn't sign up to pay for the unification of Germany. We already paid for it to be rebuilt once. Something most younger people are ignorant of; British people were still living with food and fuel rationing until 1954 because we were pumping money into the rebuilding of  (West) Germany. Our taxes built Germany's entire infrastructure not once, not twice, but three times in one century. And still Merkel sticks her greedy paw out and demamds more. Not raiding our coffers she's now turning on the Greeks. Screwing them over. Though I've no sympathy for a nation where the vast majority of the populace hasn't paid any income tax for the last fifty years. Am I \"right wing\"??

{"cid": "UgifdrTabfOqcXgCoAEC", "text": "BREXIT AND THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF GLOBALISM AND MULTICULTURAL \"EXPERIMENT\" IN EUROPE\nEU was initially created to end hostile relations between European countries. However, gradually it became a promoter of destructive ideologies like multiculturalism, globalism and feminism. It also supported immigration from Muslim majority countries which now has become a menace in many European countries. Culturally, Britain is closer to USA than other European countries. So Euroscepticism in the British context is justified. I want to see all Anglophone countries to become one United States of Anglo-Saxons (USA, Britain, Canada minus Quebec, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland). BREXIT is more than just economics. It is also about anti-immigration sentiments. England is \"ravaged\" by immigration and most Britons live in England. Except London (which is only notionally English due to immigration), everywhere else in England, BREXIT supporters won. Wales too supported the BREXIT campaign. Northern Ireland and Scotland want to stay back in EU. Britain is now more divided than before. It should rename itself as \"DK\" (Divided Kingdom of Britain). The obsolete monarchy is opposed by most people in Britain. Nothing holds Britain together any more. Multiculturalism, immigration, globalist politics and feminism should be globally opposed. Monoculturalism should be promoted. The United Nations (UN) should also disappear, because it has failed to achieve its objectives. The globalist, multicultural, leftist liberal and pseudo-secular English press is disappointed with this result. Old hostilities between France and Britain may relapse after this. This will further deepen ties between America and Britain, but in Europe, this step will make Britain isolated in Europe. I hope London (Londonistaan) will lose its 'multicultural' feature. I hope London would gradually again become British by erasing the countless number of \"mini-Pakistan\", \"mini-Bangladesh\", \"mini-Poland\", \"mini-China\", \"mini-Gujarat\" and \"mini Punjab\" zones within the city.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "অরুণ বাঙালি হিন্দু"}
