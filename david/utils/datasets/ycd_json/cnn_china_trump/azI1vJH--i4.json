Americans better be prepared for more sacrifice and patriotism are needed in the way ahead when China is forced to expand its trade to other world markets to replace the US. US trade accounted for only 20% of the total trade of China. Cut it, and China will suffer for a while. But it can mend that hole within a year or two because Chinese companies are hardworking and they are willing to cut their profit margin to the bare minimum if it means survival. I was in Yi Wu Distribution Market at Honzhou and was stunned to learn that the exporter makes only $0.001 profit on each mobile phone decoration piece they ship. But they make it up by the bulk sale and the vendor is a millionaire, and a very hard working one. Beat China's work ethic if you can. But if you can't beat them, join them and both can prosper together.

Try getting one in the 3rd world country. It is like performing for a crowd (in the PAST.) The people will cheer or boo while one is doing the parking hahaha...percentages of failing is higher lol; in that kind of situation. Life is good for the Americans; so remember not to take that for granted.  China has her own advantages. My friends refused to visit China; but they are missing alot! Don't just visit the Great Wall....there are greater things eg the hanging temple  at Beijing, Yunan, Guilin....extremely beautiful. Try to search you tube for  the hanging temple.  Japan is crime free and extremely clean, Korea too. In fact, am afraid of Europe due to high crime rate. Hanoi/ Halong Bay of Vietnam is beautiful too. There are lots of Americans in Thailand. A sea of them at the Chiangmai night market.  There are scammers every where. Just be vigilant. Every country is beautiful. Make peace not war. Visit and travel when free. The Great USA should forge good ties with all countries. The people will suffer when there is war.

That's a huge cut and the Companies instead of investing the money to expand, they buy back their stocks, increasing the values that you see today.  So in other words, the stocks climb higher not because companies are doing better but because they buy them back.  So basically the economy is doing great for the rich.

Trump Did collude with a foreign [enemy] government to usurp the Presidency.  The Faithless electoral College, whose primary job is to screen out unfit pretenders to the Presidency utterly failed to do their job.\n\nHowever, none of that stuff was considered in the Mueller report.  The report detailed a minimum of Ten cases in which Mr. Trump obstructed justice- including the first case, in which, in an attempt to derail the initial investigation, he fired, for Zero reason, one of the key people who had secured his own election, former FBI Director Comey.\n\nThese are all facts, all easily proven, and- there are people in prison right now, having plead guilty to facilitating all of that.  But, totally aside from all of that- the fact is, Trump's false assertion of executive privilege, and his instruction to his staff to not comply with subpoenas to appear before Congress- That, even without the damning evidence in the Mueller Report, is more than sufficient evidence of his continued obsession with obstructing the investigations into his corrupt financial practices, and thus Those cases are sufficient evidence of obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd, yes, I've read the report.  At least, I've read the parts that the [corrupt] Attorney General, who is, mind you, in Contempt of Congress for his own obstruction of justice for failing to give truthful testimony (perjury, thy name is Republican), and for failing to comply with a Congressional Subpoena.\n\nWhat disturbs me is that the Republican Party of today, unlike in Nixon's time, would rather continue to have a blatantly corrupt man in office, than remove him for the good of the nation.  And, let's face it- it isn't as if you'll lose the Presidency, as V-P Pence will immediately be sworn in.  Admittedly, it's remotely possible he might be impeached, Too, but it's a Very remote chance.\n\nSee, all of these Facts- and they are Factual, so they will not be found on Fox, The Daily Wire, OAN, or any of the other state-sponsored propaganda channels.  Since they are Facts, they Can be found on channels that employ fact checkers (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBS, BBC, Al Jazeera, Fox News (not the part of Fox that includes Hannity and other liars), CNBC, and so on).  Sad to say, but anyone who actually believes that the right wing \"news\" channels present much in the way of Fact-based, or simple factual news, is delusional.  They present the President's words, often copied directly from whatever insane tweet he's most recently ranted and raved on, as if it were holy writ, without ever bother to check its validity.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Steven Ratti"}

Thats not my opinion, its a fact.  I understand you hate him, but at some point facts have to matter. I dint vote for him and I think he is insane, but at some point, you have to let the guy govern, use the House to block him and beat in 2020. You cant overthrow an election because you dont like the results and that is what happened from day one and before. In the next week the IG report will come out and Horowitz, a Democrat, appointed by Obama and Holder,  and will show the whole collusion story was based on information Hillary and the DNC bought from Russian officials, the whole collusion narrative was false from day one. I know you have no idea what I am talking about because CNN hasnt told you, but its been known for over a year that this whole thing was a joke. In fact FBI knew there was no collusion before Mueller report, according to their own testimony. Watch for Horowitz report, it will prove collusion was a way to overthrow an election and nothing more.

What is, in point of fact, a high crime, is Obstruction, a crime that Trump is constantly committing, and no one who is even remotely conscious of realty can deny that fact.  And, when it comes right down to it, Trump deserves his day in court; the only court that, at present, has jurisdiction, is Congress.  As soon as they announce that they are beginning an impeachment investigation, the entire judicial branch no longer has standing, except as an arm of congress.  And- impeachment is Not overthrowing an election.  In point of fact, impeachment is there to keep a President, or a Supreme Court Justice honest.  And, in Federal Government, the Only body that can remove anyone from office- is Congress.  It is their job, as mandated by the US Constitution, to provide the President with oversight- and if the President screws up, if he impedes investigations that are, at their core, intended to clear him of all charges and suspicions, then that is obstruction.  In the end, the only person responsible for the President's bad behavior- is Donald Trump.\n\nAs for the House blocking him- they are trying to get him to do his job, but the petty narcissistic twit can't even stay in the same room before storming out and then blaming Nancy Pelosi and company for his own poor behavior.  \n\nAs for Obama, Holder, Clinton, and company, well, they've got zero to do with any of this, except as victims of libel and slander on the part of the Trump Regime and its parade of crooked lawyers and propagandists.  Too bad they cannot, as yet, sue Trump and his agents for their civil offenses.  That, of course, will have to wait until he is out of office, whether that is this year, next, or when ever he finally relinquishes power (he has often said that we would not honor any election result that resulted in a loss for him).\n\nAnd, as for a CNN coverup, sorry, but they don't do that sort of thing.

He appoints the best people for his administration and they perform their jobs efficiently and with integrity. They can be trusted to act in the public‚Äôs best interest, just like Trump. It‚Äôs too bad he filled all of the appointments by lunchtime his first day. There‚Äôs a waitlist of people who want to work for him and the original appointments aren‚Äôt going anywhere‚Äîthey love their jobs and work so well with their staffs and colleagues; they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. At the mixer Trump organized, they all spontaneously pledged their loyalty to Trump, despite his vehement insistence that it wasn‚Äôt necessary and that their only duty was to the Constitution and the American people. The economy is doing well because of Trump. (The US economy stops the exact second the winner of the US Presidential election is announced. It then resets to ‚Äúnonexistent.‚Äù The stock exchange resets to zero and the deficit goes away. It all restarts the next second. So, Trump deserves the credit for the healthy economy. The fact that the data and charts show the economy is simply continuing the trend from the Obama Administration is just a coincidence. The economy reset and restarted, remember?\n\nOkay, back to reality, Trump is a loser. He fails at epic proportions. The only thing he‚Äôs been successful at is being a fraud on every level of his life. He was given almost half a billion dollars and proceeded to start and fail one business after the other. He went into bankruptcy six times. SIX! He bankrupted a casino, for crying out loud! He would have made more money if he had put it in the bank to draw interest. In other words, the only way for him to improve anything is for him not to touch it. Everything he touches turns into a big, steaming pile of üí©. He was a loser before this abomination of an administration occurred and he‚Äôs continuing the trend. He‚Äôs in his seventies and has the temperament, discipline, maturity, impulse-control, vocabulary, and intelligence‚Äîboth emotional and mental‚Äîof a toddler. He is a malignant narcissist and a compulsive liar. He seems incapable of basic decency and integrity. \n\nI truly do not understand how any decent person could support Trump. There‚Äôs no excuse for it. His many, many deficiencies have been uncovered and reported. This isn‚Äôt about perfection, it‚Äôs about an expectation of basic, ethical behavior in an adult.The majority of people still supporting Trump are doing so because they are just like him. It‚Äôs appalling that so many Americans are so lacking in sense and morality but it‚Äôs a reality we have to deal with. The majority of them are blinded by some flavor of bigotry: For some, it‚Äôs racism against minorities. For others it‚Äôs sexism against women in power and in control of their own lives and bodies. For still others, it‚Äôs the xenophobia and arrogance of looking down on people from other countries. Of course, many have more than one affliction. \n\nThere is another recurring phenomenon I‚Äôve noticed about many Trump supporters that may explain their baffling connection to him: their inability to understand anything other than the most simplistic facet of a situation. With some it‚Äôs a lack of factual information or the refusal to accept factual information but with others, it is honestly just plain stupidity. Yeah, that‚Äôs right; I said it. More importantly, I won‚Äôt apologize for saying it. Some of the stupidity can‚Äôt be helped, but there are some that refuse to put any effort into understanding and rationally addressing an issue. Some mistake their strong emotion for fact. I don‚Äôt care how passionately you feel about abortion or homosexuality or whatever bogeyman du jour the Republican Party is using to manipulate the general public. There are always going to be people doing or existing in ways that frighten or anger you. TOO BAD. They have the God given freedom to figure life out for themselves, just as you have. If you don‚Äôt like it, ignore it. Better yet, tend to your own business and let others do the same.", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "Dark Iris"}

I grew up hearing adults disparage those rich Republicans and now we have rich DEMONcraps and that isn't talked about. We have people leave the Whithouse millions in in debt and become millionaires and Billionaires and that's not a problem when they are the Clinton's or Obama's. The truth is most or all politicians are somewhat crooked and that is the culture. The American people usually vote or the best liar or the one that might benefit them most. There are few real patriots that vote for who might be best for the country as a whole even if not best for them. I expect 2020 could prove my point that DEMONcraps will get a lot of votes with all the promises of free stuff regardless of the fact that they will tax you to the grave and piss away those tax dollars, they won't support the President on border control which costs a few billion to fix or many billions every year that it doesn't get fixed.\nTrump has taken a hard line with friend and foe because everyone before him just kicks the can down the road because it's difficult to deal with.\nIs the economy soaring? yes, is unemployment at all time low?, yes has anyone kept as many campaign promises as Trump ? ,no.\nIs America better and stronger in the first two years with Trump ?

Patriotism in this country isn't  about you, you, you, you. Its the common good for the entire country as a whole, not selling out to fucking China. You buy things made out of steel and aluminum.

You think its tough now, wait until your libtards make you go back to farming with horse and plow with the green new deal. You want to do something patriotic, plant something that benefits this country because your mistake was going down the soy road. Lets go up against Brazil and flood the market with soy. Yah, lets push a product that becomes some kind of shit processed filler. Come on over to Wisconsin our Iowa neighbor and lets talk about how tough it is for dairy farmers. Lets talk about your overhead cash cropping compared to a farm with livestock. Stick to corn in Iowa and flood the market with corn along with soy so we can keep eating soy byproducts pumped up with high fructose corn  syrup. I do realize soy, corn etc., isn't just used for food purposes, but you get the point. What doesn't go into fuel or manufactured products, gets put back into food and we end up with the shit byproducts. I bet your britches got mighty big in soy selling to the Chicom market for years but when the going gets tough you want to blame Trump. Just fucking wait when AOC has you farming with horse and plow again. My construction company, or that factory doesn't get subsidized year after year. Better get your crops in on time so you can take a loss on it and collect that insurance and subsidies.

Over 300,000 jobs were lost. Steel mills would not upgrade their production lines, and wanting to cut wages to be more competitive with Japan didn't work out. The Carter & Reagan administration refused to bail them out. With Trump trying to bring back steel jobs by adding tariffs to imported steel, has backfired when countries countered his moves with tariffs on our agriculture. From my personal view, I don't believe this was a good deal on Trumps behalf. While negotiations continue with some of these countries like China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU, until a deal is done that doesn't disrupt our farmers it's not a win.

But when there is an abundance of product on the market with no buyers because they don't need it, what do expect. in 2012 the US & Brazil each produced about 90 million metric ton of soybeans, Argentina 40mmt, Canada 5. The world produced about 275 MMT.¬† 2018-19 the US & brazil are in the 120MMT alone and the rest of the soybean producing countries are at roughly 350MMT. There is no price cause there is to much available. Looks like poor planning from year to year.¬†2012 also at the time¬†when the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) ended and millions of acres came back into production. Sure, farmers made a fortune a back then, but if they can't look ahead and see what is still on the market and figure that out, its not Trumps fault, taxpayers fault, its their fault. isn't the procuct coming out of south America easier to produce and cheaper. Until the cheaper product comes off the market there will be no price. Am I wrong? I looked this up on the internet and heard Dean Graner (a futures analyst)¬†on the radio talk about this during winter. There was plenty of time to plan ahead. They will get a subsidy payment to keep them going. In fact in 2010 every American paid $1200 in taxes to finance the farm bill. Yes, it is bipartisan too. People with barely enough money paid tax dollars to millionares in land and equipment because they can not make it. What did you get? Clinton created the current climate with trade because he thought china would become a more humanitarian country if it had money. How did that work out? Now Trump has to fix it. Both parties supported it alng with past presidents. Clinton even had them all together to sell it to the country. it did not work, millions of jobs lost, and china is now looking to take over the world. Trump has to stop it.

This drop has created a severe labor shortage in many key parts of the country vital to American farmers and iconic crops. It has also had an impact far beyond rural America: The lack of workers has not only hurt the ability of U.S. farms to grow and expand, it has cost our economy tens of thousands of jobs in related industries like trucking, marketing, and equipment manufacturing.\nFindings include:\nThe supply of workers available to U.S. farmers has been rapidly declining.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2014, the number of full-time equivalent field and crop workers has dropped by at least 146,000 people, or by more than 20 percent. Wage patterns indicate that this caused a major labor shortage on U.S. farms.\n\nThe labor shortage has hurt our country‚Äôs ability to produce labor-intensive fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts.\n\nHad labor shortages not been an issue, production of these crops could have been higher by about $3.1 billion a year. Given that farm revenues often trickle down to other industries in our economy, that $3.1 billion in additional farm production would have led to almost $2.8 billion in added spending on non-farm services like transportation, manufacturing, and irrigation each year. That spending would have created more than 41,000 additional non-farm jobs in our economy annually.\n\nThe number of potential farm workers immigrating to the United States has greatly slowed over the last decade.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2012, the number of new field and crop workers immigrating to the United States fell by roughly 75 percent. This led to a drop in the number of entry-level workers available for difficult jobs like hoeing, harvesting, and planting.\n\nSome parts of the country were particularly hard hit by the recent labor decline.\n\nThe number of full-time equivalent field and crop workers in California declined by about 85,000 people between 2002 and 2014. The vast majority of this decline happened before the drought started in 2011. The southeastern part of the United States was also hard hit. Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina lost about 8,500 workers total, or more than one in four of the crop workers employed in 2002. Colorado, Nevada, and Utah lost 36.7 percent of their full-time equivalent field workforce, or 7,029 people.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Jack D"}

Two types of subsidies given to commodity crop producers come in the form of¬†direct and counter-cyclicalpayments. ¬†Counter-cyclical payments are tied to market prices. Farmers will get paid when the price of their commodity is less than a price set by the government. Direct payments, on the other hand, are paid to a producer regardless of the market price of the crop. The payments are based on the number of acres the producer was growing when the subsidy program began.\nThe direct payments program allows a producer to plant anything he or she wants¬†except for¬†fruits and vegetables and still remain eligible to receive payments. Why would fruit and vegetable producers be excluded from receiving direct payments?\nThe short answer is that the fruit and vegetable producers did not want fruits and vegetables to be subsidized. A look back at Congressional records from the 1990 Farm Bill provides some interesting insight into how we got to where we are today.\n1990: A ‚ÄúFlexible‚Äù Farm Bill\nIn 1990, the farm bill debate centered on whether to give farmers more flexibility in what they plant without jeopardizing their eligibility for farm payments. Traditionally, eligibility was based on a farmer‚Äôs ‚Äúhistorical planting patterns‚Äù so that if the farmer switched to a new crop, the farmer would lose eligibility for farm payments.\nThe notion of allowing a farmer to plant a different crop and remain eligible for payments, or¬†‚Äúdecoupling‚Äù¬†payments from production, was quite controversial. A June 14, 1990, Reuters article reported that the Senate Agriculture Committee rejected an amendment that would have allowed producers to rotate crops on 25 percent of their base acres without losing payments or program eligibility. Then-Senator Tom Daschle said, ‚ÄúThe issue is not flexibility. The issue is decoupling. I think it‚Äôs a big mistake from a policy standpoint.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs About Flexibility: ¬†Any Program or Non-Program Crop\nDespite Daschle‚Äôs disapproval, the July 6, 1990, Senate report included farm bill language that would have allowed producers the flexibility to plant any crop on 25 percent of their land without suffering a reduction in base acres used to determine payments.\nIf producers wanted to grow fruits or vegetables on a portion of their land, the producers would remain eligible for farm subsidies.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Jack D"}

The problem it is so good as a chelator it binds so tightly to heavy metals that it becomes very stable in the environment and will not break down easily. When it combines with arsenic or heavy metals, it takes on nephrotoxic properties. Nephrotoxic means destroy the kidneys.  Arsenic is naturally in our soil, and is harmless, not so with Roundup.\n\n\nLook here for the rest of the patents; http://www.gmofreepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/glyphosate-patents.pdf", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Beeman Minnesota"}

There used to be a video on Youtube but was removed, too much truth. The Scientist showed all it took to was 1 part per/trillion of the pesticide used on GMO corn to wipe out the memory of  Honeybee so it could no longer find home. Bayer is the manufacturer of the poison, never passed a valid test for safety of the bees. Two test done both fail, but was still allowed to stay on the market.\n\n\nBeekeepers sued and won a lawsuit forcing removal. But what does the EPA do? It allows a new pesticide by Dow that is a 1000 times stronger than the Clothianidin pesticide. Their claim is that it is saver for the bees because when bees come into contact with it it will die on the spot and not carry the poison back to the hive.\n\n\nThese pesticides work on the nervous system,  when a bee comes into contact with it it goes into convulsions before death. Is it any wonder we have a new type of disease attacking the nervous system of children? It's called  acute flaccid myelitis, thought to be a virus attacking the nervous system, I think they are lying. We have roundup destroying our immune system, because of the chelating effect and it also destroys all good gut bacteria allowing the deadly Candida fungus to cause a slow death. Then this pesticide attacks our nervous system because of our compromised immune system.\n\n\nLook how much roundup is in our cereal; https://cdn3.ewg.org/sites/default/files/u352/EWG_Glyphosate-2_Table_New_C01.pdf\n\n\nLook at what happens when too much roundup comes into our bodies; http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Sri_Lanka_partially_bans_glyphosate.php\n\n\nWith the proof of the first patent and this scientific paper is proof that GMO's are deadly to all animal life. Need more proof watch the documentary Franken steer, cattle can not live for more than 3 years on a complete diet of GMO's.\n\n\nI always believed we Americans are heading for death for allowing this crap on the market OMG even Oreo Cookies have almost 300 ppb of roundup. It only takes 700 ppb to start the destruction of our liver and kidney's.

After WW2 so much of Europe's gold reserves were required for infrastructure rebuilding and getting the population back on its feet that the countries were forced to go off of the gold standard.  As long as their currencies were tied to the dollar (which was gold backed) they could maintain reasonable stability with respect to their currencies.  In the early '70's our European allies needed to expand their money supplies.  As long as their currency was tied to the gold backed dollar they could not do this without triggering hyper-inflation.  We capitulated to their requests and removed the dollar from the gold standard and worldwide fiat currency was given birth too.

Notice the Pig has now given in to Mexico and Canada on the steel and aluminum tariffs.  They would not agree to NAFTA II  (the Pig doesn't like to call it NAFTA, but that's what it is).   The Pig actually lost the trade war to Canada and Mexico because  he had to give in or they would not come along with NAFTA II.  He lost.  He's also losing with Europe, basically, backing  out of the automobile tariffs.  All those tariffs were really  stupid to start with.   I really am scared to have somebody who is such an monumental failure at business,  and such a crook, frankly,  acting like he's some kind of business genius.   I predict the economy will crash prior to the election unless he does something really horrible to stall it, like a trillion dollar infrastructure investment which will actually kill us now with the Republican  tax breaks for the rich.  We cannot afford to do another  stimulus package after the poorly timed Republican tax breaks,  but he will do anything  he has to do in order to  try to win..   This is because,  as Geo \nConway and all the shrinks have said,  his fundamental problem is his narcissism, and he cannot tolerate  failures that are so obvious he cannot deny them,.  Losing the 2020 election would be such a failure, so he will do anything  to not lose, including a horrible stimulus package and including going to war with the most convenient enemy at the time, maybe Iran, maybe N.

He was candid and said sure he took the $20 K assist, but he's not and idiot he's up on his business. He made his political choice but was open minded and that's the way it should be.  And I even watched CNN for a change and found it to be very inspirational.  Look where's the $$$$ coming from he said, certainly not China. Yep that's on you taxpayers or taken from somewhere else. Maybe the wall, as has been quiet for a while now. Farmer Cobb bailed on Trump after Helsinki and the Putin meeting. So what's wrong with the rest of people affected by insane shoot from the hip tariffs with no plan but to say \"I'll show you how to go bankrupt, it's only a game\" Farmers always complain but that's not a negative comment it's just the way it is. No rain, too much rain, failed crop(s) and no matter what your doing  a tough go, or just getting by or doing well.(not to mention farm equipment costs) He takes about steel and aluminum costs. And how they affect him (us) But that is not on China alone. So if you think 45 is doing OK take another look.\nTrumps own assistance for farmers goes against what he said about NAFTA and goes against capitalism and support for any business to be competitive.  Is this not called subsidies or protectionism as he aluded to within NAFTA  or  and other trade dealings with any country. Divide and conquer works doesn't it!!! VENI VIDI VICI Y'ALL and I ain't no pisano.\nFarmer Cobb mentioned Helsinki and Putin! And for my money the commie bastards have got a lot of what they want due to the current POTUS. Destabilization, economic upheaval, and distrust of each other can hurt any society and bring it down. If the USA was any less of a country than it is you'd be toast already. If your pissed off cause some one is a Dem or a GOP supporter WTF is wrong with you. You should be pissed of at Putin and Kim or the PRC and get back to can do. And look hard at anyone who claims they didn't do anything wrong or is flaling around trying desperately to get off the hooks or out of the net and web of lies they spewed.

The Department of Justice said that black \"testers\" were sent to more than half a dozen buildings and were denied apartments, but a similar white tester would then be offered an apartment in the same building.[9] The government alleged that Trump's corporation quoted different rental terms and conditions to blacks and made false \"no vacancy\" statements to blacks for apartments they managed in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.[10]\n\nRepresenting Trump, Roy Cohn filed a counter-suit against the government for $100 million, asserting that the charges were irresponsible and baseless.[9][11] A federal judge threw out the countersuit, calling it a waste of \"time and paper\".[12] Trump settled the charges out of court in 1975 without admitting guilt, saying he was satisfied that the agreement did not \"compel the Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant\".[13]\n\nTony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, said that the housing case was \"a classic example\" of Trump being \"a counterpuncher\": someone accuses Trump of doing something horrible, and he \"goes back at them with all guns blazing.... And admits nothing.\" If Trump loses, he will \"declare victory\".[14]\n\nThe corporation was required to send a bi-weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, a civil rights group, and give them priority for certain locations.[15] In 1978 the Trump Organization again was in court for violating terms of the 1975 settlement; Trump denied the charges.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "racerxc70"}

Hugh Carey and Robert T. Dormer of the Urban Development Corp. at the launching ceremony of the New York Hyatt Hotel in June 1978.\nAP\nDuring the presidential debate on Monday night, Hillary Clinton raised a 1973 federal lawsuit brought against Donald Trump and his company for alleged racial discrimination at Trump housing developments in New York.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Donald Trump, his father, Fred, and Trump Management in order to obtain a settlement in which Trump and his father would promise not to discriminate. The case eventually was settled two years later after Trump tried to countersue the Justice Department for $100 million for making false statements. Those allegations were dismissed by the court.\n\n\"Donald started his career, back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination ‚Äî because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy,\" Clinton said on Monday night.\n\nClinton And Trump Clash In Tense First Presidential Debate \nPOLITICS\nClinton And Trump Clash In Tense First Presidential Debate\nTrump responded to Clinton by emphasizing that the case was settled with no admission of guilt.\n\n\"Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company ‚Äî had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens,\" Trump said. \"And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country ‚Äî it was a federal lawsuit ‚Äî were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Division, which alleged that black people who went to Trump buildings were told there were no apartments available, while white people were offered units.\n\nBack then, Sheila Morse worked as one of those testers. When a black New Yorker was turned down for service and racial bias was suspected, Morse, who is white, would be dispatched to see if she received different treatment.\n\nIn this case, a black man in search of an apartment in Brooklyn in 1972 saw a sign on a building: \"apartment for rent.\"\n\n\"He met with the superintendent, and the superintendent said, 'I'm very sorry, but the apartment is rented ‚Äî it's gone,' \" Morse says. \"So the gentlemen said to him, 'Well, why is the sign out? I still see a sign that says apartment for rent.' And the superintendent said, 'Oh, I guess I forgot to take it down.' \"\n\nHow The Man Created The Brand In 'Trump Revealed'\nPOLITICS\nHow The Man Created The Brand In 'Trump Revealed'\nWhen Morse went to the building to ask about the same apartment, she says, \"They greeted me with open arms and showed me every aspect of the apartment.\"\n\nMorse says she reported her experience to the Human Rights Commission, and then returned to the apartment building. After she was offered a lease, the black man who had tried to rent the apartment entered the office with a city human rights commissioner, and the three of them confronted the building superintendent.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, I'm only doing what my boss told me to do ‚Äî I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,' \" Morse says.\n\nThe commissioner asked the building superintendent to take him to his boss. That turned out to be Trump Management.\n\nWashington Post reporter Michael Kranish, co-author of the book Trump Revealed, tells NPR's Robert Siegel that the Justice Department considered the case \"one of the most significant race bias cases\" at the time.\n\nIt was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\nMichael Kranish\n\"They signed what was called a consent order,\" Kranish says. \"Trump fought the case for two years. ... He says it was very easy, but actually he fought the case for two years.\"\n\nThe Trumps took essentially the first settlement offer the federal government provided, Kranish says; the Trumps did not, in fact, have to admit guilt in settling the suit.\n\n\"[The settlement] required the Trumps to place ads in newspapers saying that they welcomed black applicants,\" Kranish says. \"It said that the Trumps would familiarize themselves with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibited discrimination. So it also specifically said they don't admit wrongdoing, but they did have to take several measures that the Trumps had fought for two years not to take.\"\n\nTrump claims the Justice Department lawsuit was just one of many housing cases against many landlords, but Kranish says this description is misleading.\n\n\"Well, there were cases brought against various companies, but the point here is that Trump has said in the debate ‚Äî and he also told me when I interviewed him at Trump Tower earlier this year ‚Äî that this was part of one massive suit.\" Kranish says, \"And in fact, this very specifically is a case that charges Donald Trump, Fred Trump and their company of race bias in housing rentals. ... It was one of the largest cases of the time. ...\n\n\"It was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\"", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "racerxc70"}

He's another Trump-worshiping flunky, lackey who just wants to stay in power as a senator.  He'll never obtain any powerful governmental leadership job beyond senator.  Very few minorities would vote for any Republican in leadership today, even if they were to switch party to the Democratic Party.\n\n\nThis farmer that is being interviewed, and others like him, thought he saw more in Trump than a person who could help his business; he thought he saw white power and intelligence too; however, because things are not going so well for his livelihood, his business seems to trumps white power--no pun intended.  Additionally, all of the right-wing business people see the same as this farmer saw in Trump, and most of them are doing extremely well with the exception of agriculture, coal and mining businesses.  People with 401Ks, including myself, are doing better than average to outstanding with regard to our money making money. \n\n\nI've always considered stock to be somewhat fake money making money and that is why people lose so much of it when the stock market crashes.  Making easy money on stock during times like these when the world's economy is doing well could give one a sense of utmost confidence and satisfaction; howbeit, when the stock market begins to crash hard, a sudden and eerie heart-wrenching sensation just seems to enveloped you for days, knowing you had a false sense of security that that money wasn't going to be there for a very long time, but you took a chance anyway--other words, you gambled and you lost!  I believe there will be another serious stock crisis soon--either in mid-2020 or within the first cycle quarter of 2021.  We haven't had a real masses of people dying type of war yet, and if we have the kind of war we had like WW-I and WW-II where millions of people died, I don't think the stock market could rebound so easily.

I didn't vote for his Democratic opponent either. As far as I'm concerned both major parties did the nation a monumental disservice by putting two untrustworthy people on the stump.\nAs for China, trade restrictions, tariffs and embargoes have always been in the toolbag of statecraft. This ain't nuthin' new, folks.  And every POTUS has used them in one form or another. China has been waging an undeclared economic war against the US for 75 years. She has repeatedly stolen trade secrets, refuses to recognize copyright laws, manipulated markets to effect the US economy, and has been relentlessly attacking our internet infrastructure. That's not hyperbole, that's historical fact. And everybody from the CIA and the FBI all the way down to Dept. of Labor will tell you so.\nSo, I don't like Trump. He's a serial sexual predator, a failed businessman, an embarrassment as a leader, and lousy human being. Were he to run for reelection I would not vote for him.

Soybean prices plummeted from 16.80 bushels to $8 John Wesley Boyd, farmer stated and thatthey are on the losing side of the stick. There also have been an uptick in suicide calls by farmers. He also stated the President has no clear direction and only playing \"footsie with China\". How do you believe a man now up to 10,000 lies being told. Con. He may keep milking those farmers til election day. Calling patriotism. It's now been discovered recently that some of the money  supposedly for American farmers that they are waiting on went to \" foreigners\".  In addition the farmers can't get loans because of the uncertainty and going under. You want to support a decent man but how much  or where did we come from supporting a person or backing, with such shady business practices past and present. And no collusion with some 150 \"contacts\" with the Russians understand \" BEFORE\" the election. What school do I/you need to attend or have attended.  as they say do I need a rocket scientist? There is enough \"contact high\" here and somebody's smoking it. There is so much smoke here and the President is hoping we dont see it. And now wants to arrest eventually everyone who found it.  Per William Barr and family at the White House (on record ). What comes next? Is it the jailing of all suspected or \"created suspects\" being lined up by the President. Putin during Helsinki gave, as you know The President  a copy of his hit list or enemies list. Now this received national coverage. And he brought it back. Now and with any other President it wouldn't have left Putin's office, exactly. \"Or brought it back\"! But we'll just sit back and take all of this rhetoric and say nothing. Do you see it coming up to reporters  not safe being jailed or as Khashoggi butchered for his comments. Or the Wikileaks person just happened to have been murdered in the US.  Oh yeah just common day activity it's becoming now. And children being held in cages. That's just a prelude to \"other camps\" coming around the corner we want to ignore now as \"nonsense\" A Stalin era is on the horizon. And we need to wake up. Yeah \"FAKE NEWS\" to keep you quiet. Yeah be for the/this President you'd better take 10 minutes and think about what is headed  our country's way at High Noon. You can't even think of a time when folks would go into a meeting or summit and notes taken, nonsense! And you dont even know what happened.  And now he wants you to think he,Bolton and Pompeo aren't together. It's a tactic to keep you in the dark and guessing . And now \" no press\"  conferences are being held.  \"Ask me no questions and I tell you no lies\".  And war decisions being made at the top by \"one man \" Putin/Trump. And the President not wanting his taxes \"evaluated\" or the full Mueller report  ' is of no value ' per the WH ,our government . So which of us is being fooled me or you.

He just spouted the Democratic propaganda.  \n\nEspecilly the lie that tariffs are paid by the consumers. Yes u may end up paying more. But that is just the price going back up to where everyone other manufacturer is at. The price is only low to start with because The Imports (such as steel) are being dumped below cost in order to put our manufacturers out of business. Its a common Business tactic.\nExample: Cost of steel to make Widget here is 10 dollars (with like 10% profit for the company). An importer brings in steel for $5 (at a loss). The steel makers here can't compete so they close shop. Imported steel goes up to $12 because they are the only source.\nSame situation but with tariffs: Government puts $5 tariff on Imports. Their steel is now same as Ours. You can buy either one and the consumer pays nothing extra. Our steel manufacturers stay in business. The Government would only be taking $5 of ur money IF the manufacturer still bought imported steel.\nIf the tariff is $6 dollars so now imports are higher than Domestic steel. Now everyone would be buying domestic and NO tariff fees go to government. <--- this is the desired outcome.\n\nNow the problem is that China (and others) have been selling cheap here in the USA for YEARS. And yes we get cheap stuff that way. BUT our domestic companies close shop, people out of work and New Companies never get started because they can't compete.\n\nTariffs can generally raise prices but it levels out after a while. This hurst some, but in the long run Domestic is better. I remember the days when Import stood for something exotic, different. it dosens work that way today.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Armastat"}

The Trump tax cuts for example have lead to a round of stock buybacks and haven't prevented major layoffs by some of the main beneficiaries of said tax cuts.\n\n\nHell, even when the corporations do invest some of that money into their business, it is often to automatise and/or delocalise, which if anything tends to destroy jobs, or at least domestic jobs...\n\n\nAs for me calling the Grifting Old Party \"Rethuglicans\", I fail to see what the problem with calling people \"thugs\" would be, considering said people have been mugging the middle and working class for the benefit of their corporate masters since at least the Reagan years.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Adrian Libis"}

When I walked in there were colorful lights flashing, all kinds of bells going off,  the sound of coins falling and it kind of got the ole' adrenaline going. I was excited and looking forward to that \"big jackpot.\"  I finally settled on a machine and began to put some money in and pulled the lever. There were people around me doing the same thing all hoping for a big win as well, I'm sure.  This is before the paper slip payouts... I had 2 cups, a play cup and a keep cup. When I won, I put part in the play cup and part in the keep cup. As long as I had money in the play cup, I played. When the funds were gone, I took my keep cup and just enjoyed the sights, sounds and food.\n\n\n Here's the thing. What appeared to be machines paying off all over the place and the sounds of coins falling and people winning was an illusion. If you put $20 in a machine and it gives you  0.75 is that really a win even if the lights flash and the bells go off?   That is what trump represents to me. The promise of a big payday, but a .75 payout.  A carnival barker, a snake-oil salesman.  \n\n\nI appreciate the candor of the farmer and respect him for acknowledging what he expected and what he got as opposed to what he was told he would get.  I takes a smart person to  know what he doesn't know and surround himself with people who have the expertise and knowledge that they lack and trump is NOT that person.  Perhaps things are going great for you and that's awesome. For every person who says things are great, there are many more who things are not going so great for.  It's going great for trump because he is profiting, majorly.  \n\n\nWhen I think of real billionaires, I think of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and Oprah...when you have it you don't have to try to convince people of how great you are, typically they do what they do without fanfare. In my humble opinion, trump is an insecure man-child, a liar, and a con-man. There is no question that he has or had more money than I will ever see in my lifetime, and I'm fine with that. He was elected as the PresentResident.\nThe challenges I face may be far different than a farmer or a coal-miner, but I can still have empathy for their plight. One's problems doesn't negate the problems of someone else. Therein lies our humanity... which sadly  seems to be eroding daily under this administration.\n\n\nThis was just my 2.15 worth.

In effect, it IS PATRIOTIC to impose those tariffs, for the country as a whole.  This farmer guy is stuck in the crosshairs.  China put those tariffs on his crop, not Trump... you are shifting blame the wrong way.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Ian Buell"}

PERIOD.   so,  XXXXXXXXX  - try again.   Daddy didn't bail him out - he bailed himself out & made most of his money after 'daddy' was DEAD.  HOW THE FUKK did he bail him out AFTER HE WAS DEAD ?   stop FUKKING LYING.\n\n\nand ya know, there's almost no point in responding to the rest of yer comment -- but I will -- Ur obviously a partisan HACK, who believes everything the Lamestream Media throws out at you.  Trump knows EXACTLY how the fukk tariffs work, and he is leveraging them perfectly against the unethical immoral thieving CHINKS, whose STATED GOAL is Economic Dominence over the ENTIRE PLANET !  Trump has STOPPED THEM DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.  Production has already shifted away from China out to many other countries, and if you don't respect that, you are an ECONOMIC IMBECILE.  \n\n\nand WHAT FUKKING DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE whether the Saudis ordered $1-billion or $500-billion dollars of shit from us ???  WHO FUKKING CARES ?????????\n\n\nthe fact that you can't see thru the 'bullshit' - YES I KNOW HE'S A BULLSHITTER !  He's from New York --   EVERYBODY IN New York / New Jersey / Florida (New York- South) IS A BULLSHITTER !   NO SHIT SHERLOCK !!!!\n\n\nAnd the only reason he even gets close to Putin, is a) Putin obviously wanted him to win, to there's that..  b) you'd rather have a BAD RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA, and have th constant possibility of WAR with the only other power on the planet that can even come close to our nuclear arsenal ?????   REALLY ?  and not only that, Trump has single-handedly just about crippled Russia financially by keeping oil prices low..  (another reason we need a good relationship with the Saudis, capisce ? )\n\n\nSounds like, to me, that you're the one with Cognitive Decline and Mental Conditions, and U definitely are the ANTI-INTELLECTUAL, ANTI-AMERICAN VALUE douchebag in this conversation...

TELLING HIM WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR !!!   Trump is to BE RESPECTED for not taking everything the 'intelligence' community as 'fact'.  Cuz the whole 'intelligence' community is full of Obama plants, and they are all political HACKs, as is the entire FBI.   The only thing I don't respect about Trump and the 'intelligence' community, is that he DIDN'T FIRE THE WHOLE LOT OF EM !!!!!   They SPIED on him, at Obama's behest!  Guess you're OK with the FBI SPYING ON Americans ???  I am NOT.   FUKK THEM, and FUKK Obama, and FUKK U.

My pops fought in World War II, in China, and we saved those bastards from becoming Japanese SLAVES, and they turn around and do the crap they've been doing to us for the last 20-30-YEARS.

I have been quite factual and there is no denying much of what I said, most of which is on video or officially documented. Now that being said, you can tell me, which I have heard from others, that nevertheless that part simply doesnt matter in terms of your support for Trump.\n\nI kind of get discouraged when I hear the reasoning for voting for Trump is to upset the \"opposition\". Its a shame you need to vote against something instead of for something. \n\nAs for China, actually what he is doing is not good at all. Unfortunately Trump doesnt understand how tariffs work. I am not saying this in a derogatory sense, simply a factual one. He believes that China pays those tariffs into the coffers of the US, which is simply not true. The US companies bringing in the products and consumers are the ones to pay the tariffs. That is not to say tariffs can't be a good weapon to use, but when you dont understand how they work or how to use them it becomes very dangerous. Tariffs are only for short term gain, but Trump believes its an end game scenario.\n\nAs for the Southern border even democrats have been pushing for reform and to bolster up immigration policy and any informed person knows they dont believe in open borders, that's absurd. The sticking point it that wall, which Mexico isn't paying for obviously and that will take funds away from more important security measures. For such a national emergency you dont hear much about it anymore. Even Trump himself stated this isnt really an emergency he had to call. Not certain how one determines who is an idiot or not in order to allow them into the US. imagine had that system been implemented 100 years ago, the US would be far different than it is today and for the worst. \n\nSo in the end I am not quite sure what Trump has done or is doing to garner him such unwavering support aside from not wanting to see a Democrat win the presidency.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "accounting sr"}

LIE #1) Trump doesn't know how tariffs work. <- FUKKIN BULLSHIT ! - he knows EXACTLY how THE FUKK they work, and fortunately, FOR US,  he's going BALLS IN to fukk China up.  U'r just believing what U WANT to believe, Bubba..  First off, what he 'BELIEVES' and what he 'SAYS' are two different things -- I know it's difficult for y'all dipshits, but you have to 'read between the lines' of his comments.  Your comment:  \"He believes that China pays the tariffs..\" -- XXXXXXXX WRONG - OK we both know he's a BULLSHITTER right ?  I mean he is from NYC - enuf said. (EVERYBODY IN NYC IS FULL OF SHIT! - EVERYBODY in the rest of the country KNOWS THAT !!! Even if they, 'in flyover country', are dumb, they STILL KNOW that EVERYONE from NYC, New Jersey, and Florida {New York/South} are FULL OF FUKKING SHIT !  U ppl think they don't know that, BUT THEY DO..)  SO, YES,  that particular comment is a little 'bullshitty' -- China DOES, however, PAY SOME OF THE TARIFFS, in that they discount their products SOME to make up for the tariffs, so as to not lose sales. That's how they pay SOME of the tariffs in the 'short-run'.  It is, factually more of a 'cost' to them (an 'opportunity cost' to be 'FACTUAL'), and not an actual 'paying of tariffs', but still, it benefits US, and fukks them out of money..  so GOOD !  OF COURSE, again,  THAT's in the 'short-run' -- And most of th actual tariffs, that are P-A-I-D DIRECTLY, will be paid by Americans buying the products.  HOWEVER,  In the 'long-run', China will seriously PAY UP after the new trade deal is inked, becuz in the new trade deal, China's markets will be opened up in a major way to American exporters and corporations who will do business with/in China in the future, meaning that China's 'future opportunity costs' WILL BE HUGE, becuz American companies will be making money there that the Chinese always thought would be theirs.  Also, the financial benefits to American companies will be HUGE,  in effect giving America/ Americans kindof a 'rebate' on the meager tariffs that they paid in, in the meantime.. There's also the FACT that Americans will buy more from other sources, that are cheaper without tariffs, instead of the Chinese products they used to buy that now are taxed (with tariffs).  So yet ANOTHER NET LOSS of income to China, still yes an 'opportunity cost', but A COST, nonetheless.  \n\n\nso AGAIN, I understand your interpreting of the statement - IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT YOUR INTERPRETATION IS WRONG.  He said WHAT HE SAID to fool some STUPID CONservaTARD Americans that can't think for themselves - IN OTHER WORDS, HIS BASE !  -- that's why he said it -- you know, 'pandering to his base' of fukking moron CONservaTURDS ??? (YES I said reBUBBAkins are MORONS- SO ARE MOST DUMBocraps! even a higher percentage party-wise, probably, much MUCH higher..)  So bottom line, just becuz he said what he said, doesn't mean he \"doesn't know how tariffs work\" -- He knows EXACTLY HOW THE FUKK THEY WORK !  China has been using TARIFFs against us for DECADES, and now fortunately, they are getting a SERIOUS TASTE OF THEIR OWN FUKKING MEDICINE, from an American President with the intellect, balls, and power to FUKK THEM UP....\n\n\nAnd last but not least, there's the fact that China has been subsidizing their manufacturers by manipulating their currency, and in other ways, and I'm not even gonna get into that - if you don't already understand it, it would probly take too long to explain it to you, or your pea-brain would be in-capable of understanding it, and I would be COMPLETELY wasting my time -- I've already wasted enuf time here -- I'll simply refer U to a pair of Trump-tweets from earlier this month :  (THE TWITTER MASTER says it much more succinctly than I could..)\n\n\n--> May 13, 2019 10:55:22 AM\r\n\"There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be..... [Twitter for iPhone] \r\n--> May 13, 2019 10:55:22 AM\r\n...completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That‚Äôs Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That‚Äôs why China wants to make a deal so badly!...\"\n\n\nSo, DUMBASS, apparently he really does know how tariffs work.  so  LIE#1 - BUSTED.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Kevin Holtzendorff"}

Not one thing you‚Äôve said so far is true or correct and I‚Äôm not saying that as a general statement, but a literal one. \n\nSo this begs the question, why have you and so many millions of Americans gone down this path.

My uncle was one of the wisest men ever and he fought against tyranny just like many thousands of true American`s during WW I, WW II,  Korea, Vietnam, while scared cats like your tyrannical leader ran and hid under the guise of having a bone spur in his foot. I heard from many Vietnam vets who want to see the X-rays as a bone spur never goes away and as one Vietnam vet stated \"Trump sure looks like he gets around now\"...i.e, bone spurs are very painful and if had one when he was eligible for the draft at 18 then he would hardly be able to walk now!  Trump is married to a woman half his age and in my book I would refer to him as a lech and if you know how look it up in the American standard dictionary. I don't see how you can call a man who failed at several businesses and had to have his dad bail him out a \"Genius\" your IQ must be low from all the low information you've been gleaning. America fought against tyranny and always will fight against it and in fact my family fought with George Washington  at \"Valley Forge\" and in the war of 1812, in the Spanish/American war, WW I, WW II, Korea, and Vietnam, and every war America ever fought, wow now that I think about it my family didn't get along with anybody. My first boss was a Native American/original people as my Lakota friends like to remind me, who fought in WW II along with some of my Navajo cousins as \"code talkers\" ... My uncle said we would have been fighting a lot longer in WW II if not for the \"Tuskegee Airmen\" and the Nisei \"Japanese American\" soldiers of the 442 along with the men from the \"Red Ball Express\"  of which were 95% American men of African decent. So please go take your 2 1/2 IQ points and rub them together and try to keep a bug worm for a nanosecond or so.

{"cid": "UgzF3olM9_44tyvFEMd4AaABAg.8v-Z6FyZZIT8v2NucBdQQb", "text": "@Alex S Well Alex it is not that simple. Insurance companies set the standard for what care they will pay for and the length of time they will pay regardless of the care needed. This is true for individual policies and group policies as well. Except in emergency situations all treatments must be APPROVED for payment by the insurance company who will not only determine what they will pay but whether on not the procedure that the doctor is contemplating is NECESSARY. In other words some fucking bean counter that you have never met is deciding the course of your medical care, rather than your own doctor. Also you will find that not only will your premiums rise almost annually but prices will vary significantly for medications. Sometimes they go up and sometimes down but mostly up and sometimes by a LOT.  Furthermore not all businesses have to provide health insurance and business can bargain with insurance companies to craft plans that the business can afford. That means that many necessary procedures or medications may not be insured and you won't be informed of that fact until you or your doctor call them to have a procedure or medication approved.  I know , I've been there. My daughter has been going to Mayo Clinic for the past seven or eight years and recently got a bill for a procedure that she was told had been approved.

Dos personas cercanas a la Casa Blanca han dicho a The National Interest que Bolton podr√≠a ser expulsado de la Administraci√≥n estadounidense por los peligrosos excesos cometidos en su af√°n por derrocar los Gobiernos de Ir√°n, Venezuela y Corea del Norte.   ‚ÄúSe dice que Trump quiere que se vaya‚Äù, dijo el martes al portal norteamericano un ex alto funcionario de la Casa Blanca.   La publicaci√≥n recuerda que la semana pasada Trump dijo de Bolton que tiene ‚Äúopiniones rotundas‚Äù sobre diferentes asuntos y que √©l lo modera. ‚ÄúYo soy el que lo templa. No pasa nada, tengo distintos lados. Tengo a John Bolton y (tambi√©n) a otra gente que es un poco m√°s blanda que √©l. A m√≠ √©l me gusta‚Äù, dijo el mandatario.  Sin embargo, pese a las observaciones de Trump, tanto los estadounidenses como el resto del mundo saben que es Bolton quien est√° llevando a Washington a ‚Äúconfrontaciones mundiales, en particular con Ir√°n‚Äù, resalta el portal.  Se dice que (el presidente de EE.UU., Donald) Trump quiere que se vaya‚Äù, ha declarado un ex alto funcionario de la Casa Blanca sobre el posible despido del asesor de Seguridad Nacional John Bolton.  Otro pol√≠tico consultado, recordando el recientemente anunciado despliegue militar de EE.UU. en el Golfo P√©rsico y los ataques de los combatientes del movimiento popular yemen√≠ Ansarol√° a instalaciones vitales de Arabia Saud√≠ y sus petroleros ‚Äîen represalia por la agresi√≥n saud√≠ a su territorio con luz verde de Washington‚Äî, tach√≥ a Bolton de ‚Äúpir√≥mano‚Äù.  Muchos en EE.UU. comparten esta perspectiva sobre Bolton y su belicismo, en particular contra Ir√°n, y no piensan que sus esfuerzos para ‚Äúintimidar‚Äù a Ir√°n con un portaviones vayan a funcionar.  ¬øQui√©n es John Bolton?  Bolton, abogado y pol√≠tico republicano de 70 a√±os, fue uno de los arquitectos de las mentiras sobre armas de destrucci√≥n masiva en las que bas√≥ la invasi√≥n de Irak en 2003, seg√∫n distintos expertos. En pol√≠tica, mentir es corrupci√≥n y deber√≠a inhabilitar de por vida al mentiroso, m√°s all√° del castigo judicial.  Adem√°s, es la mente que est√° detr√°s de las crisis creadas contra los √∫ltimos dos presidentes de Venezuela ‚ÄîHugo Ch√°vez y el actual Nicol√°s Maduro‚Äî, y est√° empe√±ado en derrocar al l√≠der norcoreano, Kim Jong-un, y atacar Ir√°n, un objetivo m√°s complejo y peligroso, a juicio de la mayor√≠a de pol√≠ticos y analistas.  El asesor principal de Trump tambi√©n fue uno de los primeros en defender la decisi√≥n del presidente de trasladar en mayo de 2018 a la ciudad palestina de Al-Quds (Jerusal√©n) la embajada de EE.UU. ante el r√©gimen israel√≠, luego de reconocerla como ‚Äúcapital de Israel‚Äù.  e igual modo, Bolton se ha mostrado m√°s a la derecha que el propio Trump, reclamando mayor dureza contra Rusia, mientras el presidente norteamericano enfatiza la necesidad de mantener buenas relaciones con el Kremlin.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "LAS DAMAS DEL DOLAR MERCENARIAS VENDEPATRIA"}

Machinery wears out you dunce eventually it will get to the point that you CAN'T repair it anymore. You have no idea how wealthy this man is because even small farmers have to buy tractors and combines and all of the equipment to turn over the soil and that shit is Expensive, a farm tractor will cost you anywhere from $100,000 to a quarter of a million dollars and combines start at $300,000 up to half a million bucks for one basic piece of machinery. Even a used tractor or combine will cost you $100.000 and then you have the added potential expense of no warranty. And none of this includes all of the accessories that are required to actually combine and the same goes for tractors. So how far do you think that he can stretch $20,000? I don't want to hear any whining about him donating money to charity either, that helps others who aren't as well off as he is even though he isn't doing that well himself. Maybe if more people tried it this would be a better world. And finally, I am calling YOU jethro because you think that you know a lot more than you actually do. I was raised on a farm and joined the service to escape that shit it is hard physical work for 12 to 24 hours a day every day, there are very few days off om a farm and if you raise cattle for beef or dairy there are NO days off. And you're always broke. REAL farmers farm because the farm has been in their family for generations and that's all they know, the only farmers that get rich are the big truck farms that supply Del Monte, Green Giant and the like.

This farmer knows the main reason Soybeans are down in Price has very little to do with tariffs and trade War with China. There is a glut of Soybeans around the globe.  In addition, China is experiencing a swine flu among their herd of pigs that has wiped out one third of stock with no end in sight.  Because of this, China's purchase of Soybeans has slowed significantly, less need for Bean Meal, the feed for pigs.  Even if the tariffs were removed, they'd still be in a fix. Also, the President did not question his patriotism, he in fact praised it. Where the money comes from to help the farmers is a moot point, especially when it comes to the way our government is run, and that doesn't fall only on the President.

The American people do pay the tariffs, but the countries that are selling the goods don't get to sell them in America because the prices become too high.  So places like China are greatly affected because their sales drop and Americans find better sources of goods either here or elsewhere.   A tariff does not mean we don't want trade with China.  It means we want a better deal with China.  They have been taking advantage of us for decades.  When China cannot sell in America because the tariffs make their products cost too much their economy goes down just like it is doing now.  Trump is right it puts us in a better negotiating position.   I am sorry for this farmer that he is having so much trouble BUT understand that all businesses are ultimately responsible for their own business.  I have never liked farm subsidies.  If food cost more it just cost more.  It is a socialistic practice to give farmers subsidies.  It lowers food prices for everyone but the intent is not to help farmers, it is to make food more affordable for poor people.  Increase their food stamp benefits directly and let the farmers learn to manage their businesses on free market principals.  This farmer is ANGRY but he ADMITS he took the money (subsidy).

If the trade war escalates further, the conflict can make a considerable number of consumer goods more expensive.\n\nFor example, not only Chinese clothing and bags become more expensive for American consumers due to the higher import duties, but also fire alarms, laptops and furniture (pdf). And so far, a large proportion of consumer goods that the US imports have not been taken into consideration.\n\nBut if Trump continues with a 25 percent tax on almost all Chinese goods, as he has threatened, then more and more Americans will be confronted with higher prices of all kinds of products.\nResearch into the first wave of higher import tariffs shows that the extra tax of 10 percent was then mainly passed on to the American consumer. The American importers were also sometimes hit, but foreign exporters would still get the same price.\n$ 69 billion extra paid by import tariffs\nA group of economists calculated that consumers paid 69 billion dollars (more than 61 billion euros) through all import tariffs that the US introduced last year. This also includes taxes on steel and aluminum.\n\nTrump claims that China will pay the taxes. According to his reasoning, Chinese companies must lower their prices to remain competitive. But probably Trump relies on historical figures, economist David Weinstein of Columbia University in New York told Bloomberg. In practice, it appears that Chinese and other foreign companies have not lowered their prices.\nA closer look at the figures also shows that the damage on the American side is mainly suffered in areas that voted Republican. This was mainly due to retaliatory actions by other countries that scoffed at the American agricultural sector.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "panthera50"}

Hugh Carey and Robert T. Dormer of the Urban Development Corp. at the launching ceremony of the New York Hyatt Hotel in June 1978.\nAP\nDuring the presidential debate on Monday night, Hillary Clinton raised a 1973 federal lawsuit brought against Donald Trump and his company for alleged racial discrimination at Trump housing developments in New York.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Donald Trump, his father, Fred, and Trump Management in order to obtain a settlement in which Trump and his father would promise not to discriminate. The case eventually was settled two years later after Trump tried to countersue the Justice Department for $100 million for making false statements. Those allegations were dismissed by the court.\n\n\"Donald started his career, back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination ‚Äî because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy,\" Clinton said on Monday night.\n\nTrump responded to Clinton by emphasizing that the case was settled with no admission of guilt.\n\n\"Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company ‚Äî had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens,\" Trump said. \"And we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country ‚Äî it was a federal lawsuit ‚Äî were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was based on evidence gathered by testers for the New York City Human Rights Division, which alleged that black people who went to Trump buildings were told there were no apartments available, while white people were offered units.\n\nBack then, Sheila Morse worked as one of those testers. When a black New Yorker was turned down for service and racial bias was suspected, Morse, who is white, would be dispatched to see if she received different treatment.\n\nIn this case, a black man in search of an apartment in Brooklyn in 1972 saw a sign on a building: \"apartment for rent.\"\n\n\"He met with the superintendent, and the superintendent said, 'I'm very sorry, but the apartment is rented ‚Äî it's gone,' \" Morse says. \"So the gentlemen said to him, 'Well, why is the sign out? I still see a sign that says apartment for rent.' And the superintendent said, 'Oh, I guess I forgot to take it down.' \"\n\nHow The Man Created The Brand In 'Trump Revealed'\nPOLITICS\nHow The Man Created The Brand In 'Trump Revealed'\nWhen Morse went to the building to ask about the same apartment, she says, \"They greeted me with open arms and showed me every aspect of the apartment.\"\n\nMorse says she reported her experience to the Human Rights Commission, and then returned to the apartment building. After she was offered a lease, the black man who had tried to rent the apartment entered the office with a city human rights commissioner, and the three of them confronted the building superintendent.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, I'm only doing what my boss told me to do ‚Äî I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,' \" Morse says.\n\nThe commissioner asked the building superintendent to take him to his boss. That turned out to be Trump Management.\n\nWashington Post reporter Michael Kranish, co-author of the book Trump Revealed, tells NPR's Robert Siegel that the Justice Department considered the case \"one of the most significant race bias cases\" at the time.\n\nIt was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\nMichael Kranish\n\"They signed what was called a consent order,\" Kranish says. \"Trump fought the case for two years. ... He says it was very easy, but actually he fought the case for two years.\"\n\nThe Trumps took essentially the first settlement offer the federal government provided, Kranish says; the Trumps did not, in fact, have to admit guilt in settling the suit.\n\n\"[The settlement] required the Trumps to place ads in newspapers saying that they welcomed black applicants,\" Kranish says. \"It said that the Trumps would familiarize themselves with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibited discrimination. So it also specifically said they don't admit wrongdoing, but they did have to take several measures that the Trumps had fought for two years not to take.\"\n\nTrump claims the Justice Department lawsuit was just one of many housing cases against many landlords, but Kranish says this description is misleading.\n\n\"Well, there were cases brought against various companies, but the point here is that Trump has said in the debate ‚Äî and he also told me when I interviewed him at Trump Tower earlier this year ‚Äî that this was part of one massive suit.\" Kranish says, \"And in fact, this very specifically is a case that charges Donald Trump, Fred Trump and their company of race bias in housing rentals. ... It was one of the largest cases of the time. ...\n\n\"It was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about.\"", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "racerxc70"}

He is just like most of them I guess. I still don't know Trump at all, and I probably never will because of the simple fact that I never met him. Don't know the guy other then just watching stuff about him and doing my own 'background-research', like you. \nI couldn't care less about Trump to be honest. \nBut I really do like almost everything in the world that happens BECAUSE of Trump. It's hilarious, deep, interesting, human research worthy, confirming, exposing etc. etc., hence my comment. Great stuff! People are definitely drawn out of their comfort-zones, a good thing to progress as humans I feel. Reading your post you probably think that people are waking up to the danger and craziness of Trump and his posse and that we're on the brink of something terrible. Fair enough. I think that a lot of stuff is already being exposed and maybe some more is there to come. Let's see whose 'crystal ball' is more accurate. \nTo hell with the division, let's transcend the party-thinking, let's observe the (verbal and physical and intellectual) violence, let's be aware of the pains we people have to go through to get somewhere constructive and, again, transcending. \nThe decisions and people from America's ''new'' administration and president, so far, are not worse than the decisions and people from former administrations and presidents, in my humble opinion; We can argue about that till the cows come home obviously but I feel that will always remain a personal thing; The so-called facts and evidences, in my opinion again, are often highly overrated because most people have the tendency to pick out that stuff that suits and justifies their own, conditioned or 'put in by others' believes and narrative. And, on the other hand, people in powerful positions all over the world the last 5,000 years, and especially those who 'govern' others, have been lying their asses of to stay in those positions. Nothing new under the sun.\nAnyway, I guess the decisions from this administration, where you and I form our opinions partly on, are just brought a little different; Probably less subtle or sneaky, less in a way people are used to (not) hear or find out about them, less politically substantiated and more in the face of the people, due to that. New Yorkers?\nAnd of course the anxious need to find something negative around those decisions, from, mostly, the mainstream media and/or shows like this one, also helps bringing them to the public. \nDiscussions/opinions about those national and international decisions will be more interesting and find a broader foundation/audience and will increase the awareness of human beings about these decisions, and the importance of law-making and government(s)-behavior in general, no matter which side your on (let's stay nicely conditioned in our own 'duality-thinking', right?); A good thing I guess, in spite of the increasing heated arguments, name-calling, bad jokes, easy jokes, preconditioned thoughts, ideas and statements and so on surrounding it.... \nAn increased and/or increasing awareness eventually always leads to a decrease of tensions, although the tensions, often stronger felt than before, unavoidable have to come to the surface first (from any direction), to dissolve afterwards; If they stay under the surface they can be covered up, but they'll always be there.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Marc Jacobs"}

While I agree that the political institutions and citizenry of the United States needed a wake up call, I don't agree that you have to break something for it to be improved. Perhaps I'm in the minority and people do need something to break for them to pay attention to it. Only a fortune teller would know.\n\nMy concern is not with the economy. A bad economy is just the difference between owning a Lexus and owning a Toyota. The market will always cycle and right itself one way or another. \n\nMy concern is with foreign relations and the one duty (of many) of the President to be Commander in Chief. The current president doesn't have public administration experience, diplomatic experience, or military experience. All of these necessary to lead the diplomatic corps and the armed forces. \n\nIf you mess up in business (as he has done multiple times) you file bankruptcy, get a tax break, and start over. If you mess up diplomacy, people die.\n\nSo again, I have nothing personal against the man but for the most important job in our country and one of the most important around the world, I would prefer someone qualified.

Just not my thing.  Personally I don't believe human beings have 'souls' any more than my cat does, BUT I try not to argue with anyone about that anymore, cuz what harm does it do if believers wanna believe, right ?   Except for the CRAZY 'believers', Muslims for example that think they're going to 'heaven' by MURDERING non-believers -- I have a HUGE problem with those frikkin fruitcakes !  But the strange thing is, someone like me, pretty much 'anti-religious', has more in common with a lot of conservatives than I do with Liberals these days, and I USED TO CONSIDER MYSELF A Liberal !   I still think we should have things like Universal Healthcare, and don't understand why Conservatives won't even compromise on having say a 'Public Option' ,cuz if we'd done that instead of Obamacare, we'd a been a LOT better off !   U'll see what I mean when the 'Left' comes out in the future 100% on the side of getting rid of insurance companies COMPLETELY, then it's gonna become a WAAAAY BIGGER ARGUMENT than it was a coupla years ago..   It's GONNA HAPPEN -- MAY ALREADY BE HAPPENING !

GLAD to be on the same side with ya (FOR NOW!) brother !   Right now, the 'conservative solutions' to a LOT of problems is the CORRECT ANSWER..   Just remember, we coulda SOLVED the health care MESS a few years ago under Obama, if the CONservaTARDs woulda JUST FUKKING COMPROMISED, and accepted the 'Public Option' instead of being dirtbags and making the left-wing shove Obamacare down our throats.   Now it's too late for that, meaning that either in 2020 or 2024 FOR SURE, the 'Single-payer' option is likely not gonna be an option anymore -- it's gonna be MANDATORY -- MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY --  the 'Public Option' - the BEST solution in my opinion, won't even be considered !  and you think we're a 'divided population' now, well JUST WAIT !!!   cuz me & a LOTTA ppl like me will be siding with the LEFT CRAZYCAKES then, cuz that's one issue they are RIGHT on --  our current healthcare system is BULLSHIT, and needs to be taken out with the trash and BURIED FOREVER . .

Pro-choice is all fine and dandy, but killing something that has a chance to make its own choices isnt pro-choice at all. You might think im a crazed bible thumping christian (i admit i was raised in a loosely religious house) but thats the farthest from the truth you could possibly get. I believe the harvesting of stem cells is a good thing for fucks sake. But the difference between killing something to help and heal and killing something to escape a choice you made is obvious as fuck, and if none of you assholes cant look past your own problems made from your own fucking choices, your no fucking different then all the idiots who were duped by trump who you keep insulting and calling out. Stop being hypocritical selfish dipshits, and put your support towards adoption and orphange systems, as abortions dont solve the cause of your pregnancy, just the result of yours and your partners lack of planning, self control, and overall intelligence.

[ONE OF] Trump's end-goal(s) is to LOWER Chinese TARIFFS on our products, and open up their market for TRUE FREE TRADE with the U.S., something that we've NEVER HAD ! BECUZ OUR POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BALL-LESS IDIOTS !  NO OTHER President OR U.S. POLITICIAN HAS EVER HAD THE BALLS (OR THE INTELLECT!) TO DO WHAT TRUMP IS DOING !  You and all yer hillbilly-intellectuals SHOULD THANK HIM !   Instead of making up a bunch of ridiculous HORSESHIT like you just did to try and make him look bad.. You're just making yourself look like a FUKKIN IDIOT.   Up until recently, the Chinese tariffs on automobiles was 25%, while our tariffs on Chinese manufactured autos was ONLY 2% !    IS THAT 'FAIR' TRADE ???   I think not.  TRUMP is simply trying to level the playing field, and he will accomplish just that !    FUKK those thieving Chink pieces of SHIT !   GO  T-R-U-M-P !!!   You are correct about ONLY one thing - we should depreciate the dollar some, and we should do it, by simply saying to the rest of the world, OK we, the U.S. from now on are going to print money -- a fixed amount  - say 1% of GDP, and we're gonna use this money, every year, to improve OUR INFRASCRUCTURE -- We're no longer gonna give money to the rest of the world for their purposes -- we're gonna GIVE MONEY TO OURSELVES from now on, for being the mac-daddy country, with the World Reserve Currency.   There's a REASON the Almighty DOLLAR is the World Reserve Currency, and we should take serious advantage of it to improve our lives, not the rest of the world's !", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Kevin Holtzendorff"}

They raided pensions, improperly rating bonds - scoring them as top AAAA ratings when they were worthless paper and THIS in turn caused MANY to lose their homes under these horrible subprime loans, which were definitely driven  by greed.\nWhen Bush came into office, Republicans almost immediately lobbied to lift the Glass/Stiegel Act. This was a measure put into place as a provisions of the United States Banking Act of 1933 separating commercial and investment banking. This was done to ensure that the collapse that happened in the stock market crash back then, would never repeat itself. Republicans knew this and proceeded to remove these protections anyway!\n\nIn other words, this act protected the citizens and the country from situations that we found ourselves in again in 2007 BEFORE President Obama was elected. \n\nAND I must also mention how they SQUANDERED an actual SURPLUS left by President Clinton's Administration. Further, they started an unnecessary AND unfunded war. However, they did fund the very banksters that robbed the country blind and caused these people you speak of to be thrown out on the streets!!!\nEverything President Obama did to try and help those affected - they obstructed. Do we see a theme going on here?! \n\nSo let's be very clear - President Obama saved this country from the brink of disaster and as a result, also many other nations in the world's economy from total collapse. And THAT IS A FACT.\nHe did great things and could have done more if hate weren't so blinding and destructive.\n\nIf you want to make points about such critical discussions and matters; please come armed with the truth.

This isn‚Äôt the first time farmers have been through something like it and it probably won‚Äôt be the last.  I didn‚Äôt hear you throwing a fit when Obama bailed out Chrysler and Chrysler isn‚Äôt even a US company anymore. He basically gave away your money and got nothing in return. The last time a president did tariffs like this my salary tripled. Oh isn‚Äôt that sad.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Lilly Taggert"}

Cooperations and Manufacturing companies pay these tariffs so do Americans in their taxes and China doesn't pay for the tariffs in taxes they only pay for what they export to the U.S. but meanwhile the American Tax Payers are the ones who are paying for the tariffs! This'll also affect our Groceries we buy as well as other goods we purchase everyday as American Consumer's so we will all pay for this even Donald Trump's uneducated support base also Donald Trump is slowly crashing the Stock market which doesn't only affect Cooperations or the Rich and Wealthy the Stock market also affects us. My late mother Jane Wuertenberg  was Born in 1929 she'd be 90 in August if she were alive today she was born the same year the Stock market crashed Wich caused the Great Depression. My late Father Joseph Bernard Wuertenberg was Born on December 2, 1934 so my parents grew up early on during the Great Depression and I heard the Horror Stories growing up my both of my parents. In 2008 The Banks here in the USA crashed the Stock market and Then Treassury Secretary Henry \"Hank\" Paulson and then Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanky bailed out Wall Street and AIG let Lehman Brothers fail then Paulson reluctantly bailed out the Bank's so for anyone who thinks that crashing the Stock market doesn't affect them and me as well as the Rich and Wealthy think again crashing the Stock market affects all Americans so what Donald John Trump is doing with a Trade War with Chin, Canada and the EU (European Union) or any future Country he shoots tariffs on we are seeing that in a Trade War no one wins!

While you at it, also look up the speech given around 2014 by FBI director Comey and a study and report the FBI released that basically said that their national crime statistics are largely skewed based on systematic bias which is also called systemic racism. I don't know why you people continue to push this narrative that black people are inherently more criminal than others but we are not. It is based on who has the power to lock up other people. Ask yourself who is largely in the power structure, sheriffs and judges and lawyers and people in places of Power? Exactly, white men , and many likely have inherent biases against blacks like you do. therefore black are far more likely to not only be arrested but stay in jail longer even though there are plenty of statistics that show that white people commit just as many crimes and do just as many drugs as blacks. It's not that difficult to understand that if one person can have a bias about a group of people like where you assume that I am poor and likely you assume that I am uneducated and you probably assume that I am more violent than you would react to me differently than you would a white person in similar situations. You're more likely to call the police on me for things that you wouldn't in similar circumstances with a white. The police are more likely to arrest me. The police are more likely to stop me in cars. The police are more likely to not believe my statements. And you magnify that reality hundreds of thousands and millions of times and it skews the numbers and that is basically systemic racism. When enough of those in power have a general bias against a group of people then their bias will negatively affect that group's outcomes in education and health and crime rates and financial stability. All of those things are affected when everyone who makes choices are white. That is what systemic racism is. If most of the people in power who are in charge of charging crimes are white then who do you think is going to suffer the highest crime numbers in the country ?it won't be white people. It will be black and Latino men because we are seen as a threat by certain whites. It won't be Asian men because they won't be seen as a threat. This is not that difficult to understand. All you need to do is have a willingness to try to. Stop spreading stereotypes and lies about black people please. That's all I'm asking. Get some actual understanding of how racism affects statistics and skew numbers and stop with the hate.

Sure consumers will pay more for Chinese goods but the manufacturing base moved to China or Mexico. That was bad for the US worker along with competition from illeagals for jobs that have lowered wages. \n\nChina wants to be the #1 superpower and is securing raw materials and resources from other countries. They claim all of the China Sea which infuriates the other countries that are in the China Sea. They often capture Chinese fishing boats fishing in their waters. \nChina has 51% controlling interest in all foreign factories,joint venture partnerships,ect. China also claims the intellectual properties of these foriegn partnerships so they can use them in new and existing Chinese companies. The military can start and own businesses to help fund their military needs.\nI have been to China 8 times and spent a little over 6 months there. If my Chinese friends want to say how they really feel about their govt they would go down an alley it make sure that others in public would not hear them. One of my friends in Kunming said when she was going to college some of her friends went to Beijing for the protest in Tiananmen Square. She never saw or heard from them again. \nTrump is doing what is best in the long term by taking on these unfair trade deals. And the tens of millions of illeagals that have poured in the US over the last few decades hurt American workers. They do lower the costs for employers,but decrease the standard of living for the blue collar workers in many sectors if the labor market. \nI went back to driving a truck all over the US but 3 years ago I was working in Texas as a supervisor in a construction related bussiness. They payed the workers $8.30 an hour to dig ditches and work in the hot Texas climate. They never had a problem finding workers and they were from Central America and Mexico.

Another type of welfare is \"Trickle down economics\" Remember that ol' chestnut and how well did that go for EVERYONE on a long term basis (the rich got richer and the middle class paid for it. So you can stop waving your accusing finger at any ONE side of politics - they are both guilty as fuck for protectionism (otherwise known as bail outs).

Dont get me wrong, I do not know even half of what any president has ever done in terms of their policies including Obama. I believe our crisis in this country is due to the issues that come from a aggressively capitalistic market. I see the government under trump taking the power and freedom from the American people and government and undoing regulations ment to cap and help the consumers and American people. Obama helped put caps on payday loans as an example and now people in the trump administration are trying to roll back those regulations. Payday lobbyist and their company's are sending out emails with links to the public comments section for the new \"regulatory changes\" and are giving premade copy and paste comments for people to put on there. Debt and loans is what helped usher in the 2008 crisis and if regulations get rolled back, these companies would end up putting us back in the hole of 08 we recently have climbed out of. 4 year terms are a lot of time and not enough time to get stuff done but the trump administration has maximized this term in hurting consumers and trying to maximize the benefit of those in his corner as well as his BIG BEAUTIFUL BUSSINESS so he can put his name on more failed entrepreneurial ideas.

Cause i was looking into recently and there doesn't seem to be an actual increase in numbers.\nAnd sure some might abuse welfare but that doesn't mean it doesn't help a lot more people. Look at it like this. Would you get ride of the courts because they sometimes convict innocent people? A recent pilot project in Ontario actually helped people get health treatments and jobs by giving them small amounts of money. \nBut i don't get the diesel comment.  Like rolling coal? Doesn't that horribly stain your stuff?\nAnd as a Canadian obviously I don't want our gov to charge you tariffs for steel. We want to work with you.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Phillip w"}

I understand feeling the pinch of losing financial access to China, but to try to argue that American farmers are so dependent on China that farming is no longer a profitable or viable business venture under these conditions is absurd.\nYeah, there's obviously been some disruption in the market, but that's an obvious consequence of this trade policy, and farmers affected by it should be pro-active in figuring out where they need to reach out to in order to compensate for these changes in market conditions.\nConfidence can only be built upon when the market reaches a point of predictability and stability, and President Trump lost confidence in the fairness of China as a fair trading partner.

Oh dear.. what a mess. Kim is back bombing again...\n\nTax Cuts - what a fuck up! Did you make pennies in the trickle down... cos the rich got richer and the poor got crumbs. Companies are treated better than people in America. Daft country. \n\nClimate change - the rest of the WORLD is on board but OILY Trump the Moron is still going to send people down a hole for coal or fighting for oil... He doesn't care what country he has to invade to get his oil spoils... fuck humanitarian efforts...\n\nWarhawks...... Ooooh... Hillary will start a war... NOPE. Trump hires yet ANOTHER Fox TV pundit - this one a chickhawk squawking for war in the Middle East\n\nCronyism... so many of Trump's cabinet have been corrupt and incompetent... Betsy de Vos, Scott Pruitt (what a joke!), Ryan Zinke and Omarosa and Steve Bannon... not to mention Stephen Miller...\n\nHe's used taxpayer's money to jet to play golf and get money for the security detail at Mar-a-Largearse... he's already played more than Obama did and wasted FAR more taxpayer's dollars while pocketing the money himself!!\n\nRepealing and Replacing the ACA. Abject failure. Healthcare was going to be \"so easy\". I guess not then... ?\n\nYou're going to have to raise your game if you think a lie about your doctors, a tan suit and mustard is going to compare to the flaming shitstorm that is happening in the Trump world and cabinet. \nBring it. I can match every one of your Obama \"flaws\" with at least five of Trump's if not more if we include his personal life and his lying... ;)", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Jewels Star"}

I have a corporation, but it has just a few people. I don't get any welfare from the government. It's irritating to hear that corporations are somehow bad in America.  It's also just as bad to hear that somehow everyone in a political party is supporting corporate welfare. There are plenty of corporations and yes, some are actually bad.  There are also bad politicians in all parties.  There is a difference between the government paying for goods so that pricing can be maintained at a certain level (I disagree) vs government giving tax incentives to encourage certain businesses to start (I'm in agreement.)  If you count money that you never had in the first place as welfare, that's fine, but I don't agree.  That's an AOC mentality.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Alan Crane"}

The employee's wife would have a fit just as the shareholders and owners of businesses would if managers used that strategy and under the rules that govern corporations would be legal grounds for shareholders to file legal action to seek and win monetary  compensation for their loss.

The Japs changed their strategy to using high technology coupled with a highly educated, skilled workforce and modern manufacturing process to make a superior product at a lower cost.

You can easily look into the Popular Vote matter, along with why and how the 12 states have signed on. \nThe brilliance of our Founding Fathers' design can and will be realized when We the People each do our part, and ask friends and families to do the same. We can each choose some civilized, civic action. The causative factor in all our most difficult challenges is the poison intrusion of Big $ upon our elections/govt.*  Overturning Citizens United, which put our elections/reps up for sale, restoring properly drawn district maps, so our votes count as cast and so we can, once again, vote out of office reps who do not represent. We are also the only large nation remaining that has not outlawed voting machines, due to their frequent malfunctions and ease of hacking. Turns out, hand marked, not hole punched, paper ballots are the most accurate, most tamper resistant and least costly method. Oregon is doing this with great success, by mail. No struggles to get to the polls, no crowd or security concerns or lack of proper ballots and direction/guidance at the polls. These imperatives, once accomplished, will return the EC to proper condition and functioning as well. Check out the amazingly un-, non partisan group of everyday people called American Promise. We will see our govt. cleaned up and restored, our proper place reclaimed in our govt. of, for and by the People when We the People show up. I believe we will. \n*See how some of our best former Presidents, both Roosevelts-R, Eisenhower-R and Kennedy-D, faced, and faced down, these same intrusions. A 15 min. video provides an excellent decumentary of this, an enlightening and encouraging reminder of American History, although you likely won't care for the title, anyone who sees this will be exceedingly glad they did. It is called, \"Bernie Sanders: A Presidential Comparison,\". BTW, the vast majority of the video is of these former Presidents, not Sen. Sanders, although I will state that he is very highly regarded and well known in DC as a person who tells the truth, always, and one who cannot be bought-ever.

That's just not true!\"  --- Well looky here. A farmer, one of thousands who voted for Trump (a group who invariably always vote Conservative no matter what) is finally waking up from the kool-aid and realizing his Orange Overlord is a liar. Sad that it takes having a hit directly to their own pocketbook before these guys start coming out saying mistakes are being made. Shame that over ten thousand lies from their President can be ignored and even in some instances DEFENDED, but this here particular lie is where they draw the line.\n\nLook, it's great to see a guy like this \"telling it like it is\". He and any of his agriculture cohorts are very much welcome on board the sane train. But damn, people, can we not do better than this -- refusing to see a President for what he so is until his stupidity finally comes around to negatively affecting you? With some of the Trumpers out there it's as if the entire rest of the country could be falling in on itself but as long as \"I'm\" okay it's Trump all the way!\n\nBravo to this guy for speaking out. Better late than never I say. Hopefully more from his line of work step up as well. You guys may take some heat like I've just given you, but make no mistake your open candor now is heart-warming, and tells me that there is yet hope for the future, if more like you just...wake....up.\n\nNote to Trump: yes Mr. President, handing out billions to any industry to make up for fallout from your backfiring policies is very much a form of socialism. If it flies in the face of the spirit of pure capitalism that you espouse, and it does, then it most assuredly has an aspect of socializing the economy. You and your horde of minions will, of course, replace it with the word \"stabilizing\", trying to paint over the glaring truth, and your remaining FOX-watching everTrumpers will eat it up and repeat it like it's gospel. Rinse-repeat.\n\nOnly a rational outcome in 2020 will save everyone from this merry-go-round of madness.", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "CD Smith"}

To me, the Trump tariffs and their effects have done just the opposite of what we're being told. \nhttps://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html \nhttps://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c2010.html", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Rudy P."}

It's so hard, I promised myself that I would not make the statement that I just made, but I cannot help it. It's like trying to let a bird out of the house through front-door as it keeps ramming its head against window pane. It's annoying...but I digress.\n\nCorporations in the USA buy products in China, then sell those products to Americans. The spread between the buy price from China and the sell price in the USA, is their profit. When a gadget is cheaper in China, that is, generally, NOT good for the USA. The USA, as a whole, loses money when that happens. The reason is that any profit that the Chinese get by selling that widget to an American corporation goes directly into the pockets of China. \n\nIf you understand the concept of wealth, then you understand what's going on. Take trade deficit. Let's say it's $500 billion. This means that the \"cash register\" for all of China, when selling junk to the USA, shows yearly total of of say, $1.3 trillion. The cash register when USA sells to China will be, say, $800 billion. This is where the $500 billion number comes from. Assume an average profit on each widget (marginal profit) of 10%. This means that China is sucking $50 billion worth of WEALTH from the USA, each year, no matter what. PERIOD. There is no economic model where this is not true (If you are an economist...shut-up...I know about the exceptions, trying to explain something here).\n\nTrump wants that $50 billion/year to stay in the USA, or better yet, we \"win\" by, say, $10 billion a year. If China were to allow its currency to float, according to market forces, all the prices of crap in China would skyrocket naturally. I don't have time to explain why here, but if you connect two tanks of water, one high-water, one low-water, together, at their bases, by a hose, over time , water will eventually flow from high-water tank to low-water tank, naturally, until levels are in equilibrium. What China is doing with subsidies and currency-manipulation is preventing the equalization. They do this because it allows them to bleed wealth out of the USA.\n\nAbout the idiot farmer: Yes, China will raise the prices, but, over time (I estimate 20 months), it will NOT cost Americans more. The reason is that those gadgets will be made here at HIGHER prices. Before you Lefties have an I-TOLD-YOU-SO!! fit, the prices are not really higher. I have a meeting to go to, so, again, I cannot explain things that you should know if you're over the age of 20, but basically, all the prices AND wages in the USA will readjust, automatically, so that though the prices are higher, the pay rates are higher, making them effectively lower.\n\nI had a talk with a friend who owns a Mexican restaurant yesterday, and told all of the staff about their business, without seeing their books...about how it's busy, they cannot find people...then I proceeded to explain to them why it was happening (Trump).\n\nTrump knows what he's doing. This farmer is an idiot who uses words like stochastics to hide his ignorance.", "time": "2 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "David Williams"}

The \"Green New Deal\" starts down that path, but when people understand how much change is required, it becomes  clear that \"we the people\" could never cooperate intellectually and materially to pull it off.  Not a hope in hell.\nNone the less, in the interests of a futile effort to 'save the planet', these large farms have to go anyway.\nBiologically they are already on life support, having denuded the soils of nutrients, and growing crops in industrial quantities that rely on 'intravenous' supplies of fertilizers and nutrients, or they would die in that barren ground.  The rains and droughts are 'having' their way with that soil, that blows away in the wind and washes away during floods.  And the floods will come every year, each year worse than the last.\nMaybe it's time to wind up the whole thing anyway?\nOur last communities will be pockets, large and small who have learned how to live sustainably, because they have to.

Still no vanity wall for this fabricated crisis, which is odd because as much as he gloats about how rich he is I didn't see him putting any of his own money into helping fund this wall that would supposedly protect millions of Americans. So while he still golfed on the weekends, flew around in his private jet, and slept comfortably-- millions of Americans were struggling to figure out how to pay their bills, put food on the table, pay for medicine that they would die without. You've been conned into believing that this rich 70 year old man child who inherited everything he has, been bankrupted multiple times, lost billions in a year, is somehow the answer to your problems. Is somehow going to put Americans first. He demanded Americans to make sacrifices but what sacrifices has he made? NONE. I semi get why people initially voted for him.

These people are not immigrants, they are ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, big difference. Just like your false claim of how more children are being raped by Americans than illegal immigrants do to Us citizens. Illegal immigrants have broken the law and violated the constitution by not coming here properly. In addition to this, many illegal immigrants are committing egregious crimes and idiots like you turn your head when you hear about it. Kate Steinle, a beautiful 17 yr old girl was brutally shot and killed by an illegal immigrant deported 5 times under Obama under his catch and release policy. A police officer in California was slain by an illegal alien last march, his baby will never see his father growing up now. You need to settle down and stop defending these people. And stop it with this white privilege, it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. These people are breaking the law and therefore they need to be punished. No one is above the law, regardless of your race, so stop trying to make this all about race. Now go back to your country you illegal alien.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Marco Buglione"}

Are you the only one here that doesn't realize that Trump us Putin's puppet and he owes lot of money to Ruusia and that's why he allowed them to hack our democratic 2016 elections so Hillary would lose and he would win. Trump didn't win the populat votes remember. He was losing the elections. I watched the polks that and he had no xhance of winning. But a little help from the 29 Russians hacjersxwho were arreste DC and a cused of creating a massive snear xampaign against Hillary and it worked.

It in fact illustrates multiple offenses of obstruction, and in fact does outline multiple events or series of events that very much points to some very questionable ties to Russia and Russian interference.

The choice between waffling Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a tough one. Whilst it was perhaps more obvious to we outsiders that Trump was full of hot air, the light burns dimmest at the base of the candle. So I can understand why Mr. Christopher Gibbs voted for Trump based on the reasons he noted. However, I do feel that those who continue to support Trump at this juncture do perhaps deserve everything they get. By now, it should be apparent that he is incapable and a culpable lier of the most extreme proportions even for politicians who have always spoken in half-truths and innuendo and will continue to do so. However, looking from afar, the Democratic Party still does not appear to have grasped that they are still relatively weak and without a strong leader. That creates a dangerous situation where Trump may very well be elected to a second term. A second term for someone like Trump is extremely dangerous as he will no longer be under pressure to garner votes and he will see reelection as carte blanche for executing the most extreme of his ideas. There is also the possibility that he will improve in the second term as he will no longer need to appeal to his base, but I think that you and I will perhaps agree that this scenario is unlikely. In any case, the people of the United States who oppose Trump need to prevent his reelection at all costs but you will not achieve it by knocking and bashing people who voted for Trump on social media.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Andrew Jones Productions"}

They obtained 10 years of his tax returns from 1985 until 1994 from Deutsche Bank, the only bank that loaned him money when all other banks refused to. It shows that he lost more than $1 billion during that time. There are videos about it here on YouTube too? It was all over the news including the NY Times. How did you ever miss that important news???  He didn't want them shown because it proves he's a big loser and a terrible businessman.

Why is it that he's the only president who's ever refused to show his tax returns?? If our president isn't financially stable nor ethically honest nor law-abiding well that reflects negatively on his character, don't you think?? Well by your logic, there was no reason for Obama to show his birth certificate to the nation. And Trump sure bitched about that and made it a huge deal just because Obama is black and Trump didn't want him as president. There was no other reason for his unfounded conspiracy theory!!! Obama eventually showed his certificate which no other president has had to show. Even Trump admitted years later that Obama is a US citizen. That is a more  personal and intimate document than some tax returns. Us lowly American citizens have to show our tax returns for different reasons so why can't the president of the US do the same??? Isn't he supposed to be an example as the most law-abiding and  honest highest ranking government official??? He's a piss poor example for our chimdren and young people.  He always has something to hide which just makes him look more guilty in the long run.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Juana Torres"}

It's not looking good for the trump train, as a matter of fact it appears to be derailed by trump himself, who would have guessed that. To be completely honest I believe that trump is going to lose by one of the biggest margins in the history of this country. And even the most ardent supporters in the Senate and the house of representatives are starting to see this train wreak. So my question is, how long is the republican party going to stand by and watch trump destroy there party, and I also believe that at the republican convention, you'll see some of the frustration with trump come out into full view.
