It had no teeth in it, problem was being most of those areas was across the redline called redline  districting which was created back in the last world war where Gov drew a line in cities knowing across the line loans would be at high risk, sub prime loans. But it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Then came along Pres Clinton where even in his speech he wanted everyone to own a home, but still the same problem. What changed that was the U.S. during Clinton ear went through a technological Revolution, economy was taking off as housing was during that time the Ins Co and banks wanted to partner up but had to clear it with Congress as to it not being a monopoly. This was when Clinton in a nut shell said to the Banks I will not block this partnership BUT you Banks have to have make so many loans across the ‚Äúred line‚Äù which was put in place during the last world war. Where Gov was offering Vets cheap homes loans but said NOT across the Red line Meanwhile he banks told Clinton those people cant meet the basic criteria to qualify, Clinton said my people will work with you people (banks) to streamline the loan process so people can qualify Banks said what if they go sour Clinton said Fed will back the loans Banks were required to make so many loans across the red line to get ‚Äúcredits‚Äù that Clinton wanted to regulate that enough loans were made in his Dems poor voter base. This worked for a very short time until Clinton did his China Trade act causing over 42,400 Factories lost, millions of workers lost their jobs by the day and now couldn‚Äôt pay their mortages. Dems FAKE NEWS to protect Clinton Lied and said it was the Banks that did all those sub prime loans LIES U.S went down hill so quick now the assessments of those homes values tanked by the months  Another Democrat player was Franklin Delano Raines Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, who served as White House budget director under President Bill Clinton. His role leading Fannie Mae has come under scrutiny. He has been called one of the \"25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis\" according to Time\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Raines", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "john knowing"}

The Trade war and the recession was SOLELY because of Democrat Pres Clinton and started in 2000 When Dems Pres Clinton spear headed and created the China trade act didn‚Äôt learn from NAFTA he signed in 1993 Clinton wanted ti stop the sweat shops in China Dems bleeding heart B.S. China didn‚Äôt even want the deal which was Clinton will historically lowered U.S. import Tax with China if they joined the WTO World Trade origination so they can monitor how China treats its people By Dem Clinton lowering the Import tax, U.S lost its wage buffer to compete with China. China didn‚Äôt even want the Trade deal. It went to the 11th hour as Clinton mentioned in his southwest lawn speech proclaiming how this will help the U. S. Selling to China‚Ä¶ Because U.S import wage buffer gone, according to Gov website chart ,US lost lover 42,400 factories from 2000  to 2009 U.S had LESS factories in 2009 then before the bombing of Pear harbor Dems HIDE this and LIE LIE first blaming Brush for the recession, Then it was point the finger at Reps etc saying Business was greedy and sent the jobs overseas FALSE. U.S now could NOT compete with China cheap labor because of Clinton. Business had only 2 choices, farm out the work to cheap labor and mostly that went to China OR shut their doors  Clinton Killing U.S. factories also caused millions to lose their jobs and savings. Democrats also caused the housing collapse because people lost their jobs", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "john knowing"}

{"cid": "Ugx_ouk2wjEwyVQKsIh4AaABAg", "text": "The USA is one of a handful of CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES.   Free trade has made America weak and dependent.   Free Trade has destroyed American manufacturing and cast into perpetual jobless-ness or 'you want fries with that' minimum wage , millions of everyday Americans.  Illegal immigration and under the table wages has destroyed the opportunity for the 'working poor' to obtain long term gainful employment.  The illegal Mexican or Central American immigrant working under minimum wage, without workers compensation gets the jobs the working poor citizen might get.   This illegal employment has a triple effect (1) it removes taxes from the American system (2) it makes American citizens more dependent upon government aid and (3) the illegal immigrants who seek medical care or injure an American can skip out on that responsibility.  The USA is one of the few CONTINENTAL SIZE Countries that is independent on outside food supplies, has sufficient water,  independent energy resources and has EVERY strategic or industrial metal within its borders (save three - one of which is titanium).  The only countries that are similarly resource independent are Russia and Canada.   The three areas where International trade outpaces the USA is (1) cost of labor (2) lack of environmental protection laws and (3) the legal cost of complying with America's employment laws.   To compete on ground (1), the cost of labor ACTUALLY HURTS the average American as it is a race to the bottom on salary and benefits where in the end the American citizen must live like a citizen in Haiti to beat out the low wage and that is a STUPID RACE that we can not win and should not want to win.    The only way to MAINTAIN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE USA...which has dropped for at least 2 decades in relation to the Worlds other countries is to develop a fully functional N. American production and demand economy where we are able to keep the standard of living high and attain full gainful employment at a living wage + benefits.   FINALLY...AMERICA SHOULD NOT NOR SHOULD IT SEEK TO COMPETE WITH THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD REGARDING COST OF LABOR AND THE ONLY WAY TO NOT DO SO IS.....MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND SELL IT IN AMERICA.", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Bambi Able"}

He's still letting them be imported and sold here. What he did was make it a bit more expensive for a knockoff, did B&T industries no real favors, and the extra money from the tariff goes to the treasury to help cover the massive revenue loss and infrastructure damage his Rich Fucker Tax Cut is going to cause this country for decades to come.

{"cid": "Ugwt877sLg0zVJb9Kux4AaABAg.8us46lX3mq58uxsQhMQqbq", "text": "@MegaEdouble1 ,\n\" How much this affects the everyday working man,\"  lets see how this plays out.  Here we have an everyday working man. His expertise is assembling washing machines. Currently , washing machines are a little bit cheaper because they are made in China. But , everyday working man can not afford to buy the cheaper washing machine ! Why is that ? Because the job of assembling washing machines is in China. And our everyday working man is NOT working.  There are no jobs for him.\n  Who else might be affected by this ? Well , washing machines are made of steel.  The steel for them is being made in South Korea. Not the United States. Which means many former U.S. steel workers are just that, \" former \" steelworkers. Former well known steel cities such as Youngstown, Ohio now look like  ghost towns. Lots of boarded up stores in Youngstown. Why ? Because steel is \"cheaper\" from South Korea. If the steelworkers are not working it also means they are not buying cars. At least not the more expensive American cars. If the steelworkers are not working it means that the iron miners of Minn. are also not working.  Nor are the iron ore ships on the Great lakes.\n  Washing machines are not the only businesses like this. There are many and the effects spread out like the ripples on a pond from EACH one of those former businesses. \n  I've seen comments about wage stagnation. If a company is not selling enough of it's products it cannot afford wage increases. The Democrats like to blame President Trump for that. It's not his fault. It's been going on for a long time.

{"cid": "Ugx-ADZ_tlIkPikgHGF4AaABAg", "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but not ALL of the tariffs will be passed onto American consumers. Chinese sellers can't simply increase their prices by 25% as that would make them less competitive. American consumers/companies would simply buy their products/supplies from other countries or locally. Of course, the costs would likely be higher since China sells cheaper than everyone else due to cheap labor, economies of scale, etc, but it will NOT be 25% higher. Other countries also have scale and cheap labor and it would be no surprise that they are selling at anywhere between 2-10% more expensive than China. In the end, Chinese firms would also have to cut back on profits OR business costs in order to stay in business. We already see many small/medium Chinese factories flocking to Vietnam where overheads are cheaper, in an attempt to lower business costs while preserving as much profit margin as possible. So how much of the tariffs WILL be passed to American consumers? That would depend on the prices that the competitors of China (including local American firms) are selling at. If they sell at 10% more, then American consumers pay 10% more. And that assumes China does not try to compete by undercutting, which if they do then Americans will be even happier. More importantly, we are only talking about the short term. In the longer term, other countries as well as local American factories will increase their production volumes to accommodate to higher American demand and as a result will lower their prices, pushing the extra costs that Americans bear even lower. Again, correct me if I'm wrong, but American consumers will not bear even HALF the costs of the tariffs. Instead, it is China that will be severely impacted and will come out as the bigger loser because for every 10 goods America buys from China, China only buys 2 goods from America (or some similar ratio to that). Therefore, China will be hit 5 times as worse. In order to win, China would have to find other countries to sell to, and this is where America and China will have a fierce competition on bilateral trade agreements (which Trump is very fond of) to try and bring as many countries over to their side as possible. As it stands right now, China has a pretty bad reputation for getting developing countries into debt-traps, plus their style of governance is at odds with those of Western democracies. In the PR war for the worlds nations, it does seem that America would have the upper hand. Long story short, things will be okay in the long term, and even in the short term it ain't that bad. Not to mention, while all this is happening, large amounts of tariff revenues will be pouring in to help with the short term losses. Love to see what the rest of you all think. To clarify, this isn't a scholarly article so obviously I have simplified some things and left out disclaimers, exceptions, etc,  and am just making the main point to keep it short (as if it isn't long enough already).", "time": "3 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Xavier Cham"}

They may stop using China, but switch to another lower cost center; this is happening inside the States now were Customer Service Call Centers move from city to city, looking for depressed local economies with infrastructure and tax breaks to move into, until the next cheaper area is found.  The only way jobs come back is:\n1) Produce something cheaper than anyone else  (Cheap labor, Cheap materials; Can you say FoxConn?)\n2) Produce something that no-one else technically can (Intel, but they produce the chips outside the country\n3) Produce something that has artistic value or a desired quality that no one else has.  (The Luxury Items... )\n\n\nThe issue is not just faced by United States, it happens to any economy that allows trade with other economies of lower cost. \nDo you want to close all the borders and ports and force things to be built here?   Then all you have to look at is the inflation of Japan, this move would make the US GDP as more worthless than an African nation.  No one wants inflation...  But it happens.\n\n\nPersonally,  here's what I would do to address the mass exodus of manufacturing and wealth protection rackets.\n1) Modify the Intellectual Protection (IP) laws that they can only be protected in the United States courts where the company's profits and taxes are collected and invested in the United States.   (IE, none of that off shore 'Headquarters' to route profits.   Sorry Google, and everyone else)\n2) Modify the IP laws to offer protection for a shorter period, we've become stagnant, we need to foster continuous innovation. \n3) Stop babying/Protecting the old ideas, Do you know how many stupid things are done to satisfy the protection of old guard models, look up what Taxi Unions have done to cripple progress to keep their profit running, heck, Coal and Oil fighting anything electric and cheaper recurring costs.   We'll cut off a limb because a freaking MBA retard is crying about their dying profit model.   Why do you think that computer printers are so cheap?\n\n\nLife is a moving target, we're looking for the ultimate comfort and ride it, but with out taking some control we may not like were this ride is going to end.\n\n\nOk, I'll get off my soap-box now.   :)", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Jay Long"}

It took decades to get those other countries to undo those tariffs.  And the depression drug on and on.  It took WW2 to really undo it.

The quote tax cut is evaporating with increase energy costs and now consumer goods, stoves, water heaters refrigerators, autos, clothing and other import items will have price increases. These items mentioned will either be hit because of energy costs (oil) or import taxes (tariffs). Plus supply chains will be affected and companies will realign productions and recieving points. So jobs in America will be affected, good example Chinese placed tariffs on soybeans and nut products. So the almond producers and soybeans growers lost a large market because china is sourcing from other locations. So equipment sales are down, chemical and fertilizer sales are down and a increase in delinquent loan payments.

They own the Guinness beer company, were members of the UK Parliament, and also bankers that established Guinness Mahon Bank which they later sold off. The Guinness brewing business was involved in rigging the stock market known as the Guinness share-trading fraud however only the executives were arrested and not the family owners. J Rothschild Holdings was involved with the insider trading but were not charged with any crimes. The Guinness family have intermarried with the Furstenberg and Rothschild families and do business with the British Rothschild branch. Jonathan Guinness is a British Peer and worked as a banker. Patrick Guinness is a Catholic Knight of St. Lazarus and holds a claim to the title of Kingdom of Jerusalem which makes him high level. Patrick Guinness is involved in blood trafficking like many distillers involved with royalty. Many members of royalty and nobility are involved in drinking adrenaline filled human blood. Patrick Guinness holds the title of Count of Neuchatel, Switzerland. Some of these Irish clans are working with both the Catholic Vatican and Protestant British Crown. Members of the Guinness family include Arthur Edward Rory Guinness the 4th Earl of Iveagh, Kenelm Edward Lee Guinness the 5th Baron of Ashford, Sir John Ralph Sidney Guinness, the very evil Desmond Guinness, Jonathan Guinness the 3rd Baron of Moyne, Daphne Guinness, Aster Guinness, Valentine Guinness and his ex wife and witch Lulu Guinness who is insanely evil, as well as Tom Guinness. Valentine Guinness is a ruthless psychopath that sends me constant death threats. Baron Ken Maginnis of Drumglass is a British politician, baron, and former soldier. The Guinness family branched off from the Maginnis clan. The Guinness family claim to be related to the McCartan family. A ruthless and pure evil gang stalker named Alison-McCarthy Senatro works for the Guinness family. She is evil in every way possible. The Guinness Partnership founded by Edward Guinness the 1st Earl of Iveagh is a subsidized housing company that owns 65,000 homes in England. This is modernized form of feudalism. Wealthy families conspire together to monopolize wealth, land, and industry and then provide small homes for the people they are oppressing and call it charity. The right thing to do is to lock up these criminals and seize their monopolized wealth and assets obtained through fraudulency to be distributed among the people they are oppressing.\n \n\nThe Hennessy family is influential Irish bloodline. The banker Edward L Hennessy Jr. was a financial adviser for the Vatican, Roman Knight of Malta, Papal Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, and a Papal Knight of St Gregory. Edward Hennessy Jr was also the director of Lockheed Martin, Traveler‚Äôs Insurance Company, Automatic Data Processing, New York Stock Exchange, Union Texas Petroleum Corporation, the United Way of Tri-State, the Coast Guard Academy Foundation, Inc., DNA Plant Technology Corporation, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the United States Export and Import Bank. John Leroy Hennessy is called the \"Godfather of Silicon Valley\" and he is a board member for Google, Cisco Systems, and Atheros Communications. He was a president of Stanford University and still has authority at Stanford which oversees most major tech companies in Silicon Valley. A gang stalker named Derek Warriner works for these Irish bloodlines and he like a member of the IRA. He creates homemade explosives and he has sent me about a thousand death threats since Whitey Bulger died. Matthew Hennessy is an Irish computer scientist involved with coding. John Pope Hennessy was an Irish and British politician who was the Governor of Hong Kong during British rule. The Hennessy family own Jas Hennessy & Co the largest producer of Cognac in the world. They merged their Cognac business with Moet et Chandon champagne and created Moet Hennessy and Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton which is ran by Bernard Arnault who is worth about 37 billion. Bernard Arnault does business in London and with Diageo which partly owns LVMH and Hennessy and produces Guinness from London. Bernad Arnault is a Knight of the British Empire so he can do business in London. Bernard Arnault serves the House of Bonaparte as Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour which was established by the still existing House of Bonaparte and they are serving Rome. Jean Hennessy was a French politician descended from the branch that created Hennessy Cognac and also part of a French political dynasty. Jean Hennessy appears to be the father of Kilian Hennessy who merged Hennessy with Moot et Chandon champagne. Patrick Hennessy ran Ford Motor Company in London for decades. John Hennessey created the well known Hennessey Performance Engineering in Texas.\n\n \n\nThe Bailey Family are another Anglo-Irish bloodline involved in British banking as well as a political family in the United States and United Kingdom. The Bailey family are British Peers as the Barons of Glanusk. Andrew John Bailey has been Chief Cashier at the Bank of England and is currently Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Alan Bailey is a Knight of the Order of the Bath and worked for Her Majesty's Treasury. Alice Bailey was an occultist and developer of the New Age religion as well as the co-founder along with her husband Foster Bailey of Lucifer Publishing Company later renamed Lucis Trust. Lucis Trust finances occultic teachings. Many videos promoting the occult on the internet are financed by Lucis Trust. They are financing Luciferian cults fronted as \"seminars\" around the world and have operations in the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The Lucis Trust has Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. There is an extremely evil and ruthless child murdering satanic witch in my region named Jamie Cahill-Bailey and she is married into this family. There are dozens of British and American politicians with the name Bailey through out the centuries. Bailey's Irish Cream is a popular cream liqueur owned by Diageo which was partly created and owned by Guinness. Bailey's Irish Cream is named after the Bailey's Hotel and its owner James Bailey. Mansfield Brewery was an English brewery established by William Edward Baily and was bought by Marston's Brewery which has over 1700 pubs in the UK with yearly profits of over 20 million. Anthony Bailey is a delegate for the Bourbon-Two Sicilies Constantinian Military Order of Saint George, Knight of the British Empire, and Vatican Knight. Anthony Bailey works in public relations, politics, and charities and his wife Marie-Therese von Hohenberg is of Austrian nobility. Thomas H. Bailey who is worth over 1 billion founded Janus Capital Group which is now Janus Henderson operating from the City of London headed up by the British knight Richard Gillingwater with manage assets at over 300 billion.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Izreal Zeus"}

China is nothing but a red communist controlled country that steals anything they can, and has slave type labor. So many people that there is unlimited available. They sensor things all the time and terrified of losing control. Most all of their companies are state backed, so they can sell under cost but have jobs available. \n\n\nThere are lots of things in the older trade agreement the USA should have never agreed with. It's really all in China's favor. These trade agreements were created to help develop third world countries while somewhat hurting others. Its worked well and suppose to help stabilize peace. But China only cares about itself with long range plans. Easier to do when the government has total control. No idea why the people there want to live under that mess and pretend its great. So yeah, they need to get a better deal and hold to it. Plus the greedy American companies should wake up, but of course they are not.

Its made in China because of the supply chain. Because just about every single material, part, conponent, many of the silicon fabs - these things they're all made there too, \"right around the corner\". Making these products in the US still means cross-continental import of 90-98% of the materials and components from China, South-Korea and Taiwan. All you'd really do in the US, would be assembly. And that extremely more costly supply chain, would ultimately make the finished product cost a helluva lot more than 25% extra. Meaning you're nowhere near competitve, and you go bust.\n\nFor your vision to work, the US would have to have an extremely diverse, huge, well-estsblished industry that make all those required components and materials domestically. We don't have that. Building that essential supporting industry would take decades, not months. And still we would need to sell to the rest of the world for that kind of industry and scale to make sense and be viable. Meaning competing with Asia on their de facto global leader turf, where they have half a century head start.\n\nWe're better off playing off our own strengths, cultivating and improving those, solidify that in the global market - than clinging to a fantasy about companies that serve a global customer base, would be moving manufacturing away from their sweetspot and to the US, to make their products, t utopian level best case scenario, 5% cheaper for 4-5% of their customer base. While making it more expensive for 95-96% of their customer base, and ultimately lose both competitiveness, money and jobs.\n\nAutomation is here to stay too, and US industry is rapidly adopting. Manufacturing and manuf. jobs aren't coming (back) to the US. Ever. Many new jobs will come of the inevitable push towards renewable energy, cleaner industry and trsnsportstion etc, but automation will be the foundation there. Net sum, manufacturing jobs will continue to plummit. People need to learn new trades - and it's never to late to teach an old dog new tricks. What we will be in desperate demand of, is health ans care workers as living age increase, electricians, plumbers, hydralics workers, builders, electrical and mechsnical engineers... and people to assemble, maintain and repair automation equipment.

In other terms, a budget is an organizational plan stated in monetary terms. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the purpose of budgeting is to: \r\n\r\nProvide a forecast of revenues and expenditures i.e. construct a model of how our business might perform financially speaking if certain strategies, events and plans are carried out. \r\nEnable the actual financial operation of the business to be measured against the forecast. \nSo  in other words, when you take money away from projects that is already allocated for other projects, then something else has to go wanting.

And that, fellow citizens, is what will make America Great Once Again!\n\n\nTrump brags how much the IRS  is taking in on the tariffs from American importers:  \"Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind.\"\nDoes he understand this money is coming out of the pockets of US consumers...which will not bring wealth but transfer it from their pockets to the government?   Is this one of his schemes to fund the tax breaks for the rich?   \n\n\nHe added: \"Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped.\"  Huh?  In fact, American farmers are suffering because  China is meeting US tariffs with tariffs on US goods, including agricultural, which is driving farmers into bankruptcy.\n\n\nTariffs Drive Farm Income Down and Equipment Prices Up - The Atlantic\r\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/tariffs-drive-farm.../583684/\r\nMar 19, 2019 - The higher equipment\" costs brought by tariffs are just one part of a global economy that's not particularly friendly to American agriculture these ...\r\nU.S. vs. China trade war: Iowa farmers take another hit as tariffs increase\r\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/.../agriculture/.../us...farmers...tariffs.../1143730001/\n\n\nPolitico reports: \"Trade disputes ‚Äî namely the escalating feud with China ‚Äî have weighed on commodity prices and the president has threatened to ratchet up tariffs rather than ease tensions come Jan. 1. To boot, ordinary business costs like fertilizer and fuel appear to be on the rise, further squeezing bottom lines........The Agriculture Department‚Äôs Economic Research Service has estimated that 2018 net farm income will be $9.8 billion, or 13 percent, lower than the year before. Adjusting for inflation, farm income is barely above the lowest level since 2002.

He  has also frozen billions in Venezuelan currency , which it was to use to buy food for its people.   His policies are causing starvation, and let us not forget he has proposed cuts in SNAP benefits which currently give the needy about $4.20 a day for their three square meals, $1.40 a meal.  \n\"According to USDA, more than 41 million Americans face hunger, including nearly 13 million children.

Trumpster has made it clear in his stupid tweets that he thinks tariffs are paid by China directly to the US Treasury. The more we slap on the tariffs, the more China is paying the US. If we have more tariffs than China, we're making more than China. Which is why he keeps doing it and says it's good for America.\n\nAnd he is completely wrong. \n\nTariffs have their place in trade to help even out some differences when it comes to imports hurting domestic production. But it can't successfully be used as a long-term, mass weapon. And since the importers pay the actual tariffs, those added taxes are usually passed on to the consumer in increased retail prices as part of the package. Add on to that the taxes being used to boost farmers pockets for the lost income due to the tariffs. WE are the ones paying for this.\n\nThe idiot in the White House who has no grasp of economics is hurting the average citizen.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/trump-who-pays-for-tariffs-trade-war-costs-2019-1\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2019/05/trump-exaggerates-tariff-revenue/", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Kevin Williamson"}

However, these same industries are now thriving and hiring workers more rapidly than the metal industries themselves.\n\nHow can that be?\n\nThe answer is that price increases are getting passed down the supply chain. And at the end of the chain, consumers are buying the goods because their incomes are rising.\n\nThis illustrates a fundamental fact of the U.S. economy: Many markets are made up of just a few sellers, and they all tend to raise prices together. In a growing economy, consumers who are feeling confident about the future simply pay the price increases...\n\nBy cutting taxes and embarking on deregulation last year, the Trump administration gave a boost to the economy. This is helping consumer incomes rise. At the same time, the tariffs are stimulating domestic U.S. manufacturing. So all boats are rising..\n\nTariffs work to deliver a boost to the U.S. economy in two ways. First, they make foreign goods more expensive, which shifts demand to American-made products.

No significant differences between old and new NAFTA deal. Main difference is now it has a stupid name trump tried to give it that no one uses. See Reference 1.\n\n2. New NAFTA still unratifed, will probably die on the table, see Reference 2.\n\nReference 1:\nJean Chretien says Donald Trump is \"unspeakable\" and his rise to the U.S. presidency heralds the decline of the American empire\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/chretien-says-rise-of-unspeakable-trump-marks-end-of-the-american-empire-1.4127123\n\"... October 9, 2018...\nChretien unleashes that unflattering opinion of Trump in a new book of anecdotes from his 10 years as Canada's prime minister .\n...\nChretien also weighed in on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The 14 months of tortuous negotiations and repeated threats by Trump to rip up NAFTA and impose ruinous auto tariffs on Canada turned out to be \"a lot of talk for nothing,\" he said .\n\"He changed the name and not much else,\" Chretien said, adding that the NAFTA partners made \"a little bit of an adjustment but basically we still have a free trade agreement with them that will work about the same way that it was working before.\"\n...\"\n\nReference 2:\nTrump 'messed up the clock' on USMCA, current form 'dead': former U.S. ambassador\nhttps://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/politics/2019/5/3/1_4407446.html\n‚Äú... May 3, 2019 ...\nOTTAWA ‚Äì U.S. President Donald Trump has \"messed up the clock\" on getting the renegotiated NAFTA deal ratified, and it may now die in its current form, says former U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman.\nIn an interview on CTV's Question Period, Heyman said that the deal in its current form is dead.\nAfter nearly 14 months of negotiations, the trilateral trade pact was reached last fall, and signed a short while later. It is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA in America, and the Canada-United States-Mexico-Agreement, or CUSMA, here.\nThe deal has been heralded as a win by all three countries although concessions were made, including on access to Canada's supply-managed sectors. Since the signing, all attention has been focused on ratification given that the existing NAFTA will remain in place until its revamped version is fully ratified.\nAs things stand, time is diminishing on that possibility given the amount of movement that would have to happen across North America over the next six weeks. That‚Äôs when Parliament rises for the last time before the October election will be called.\nAmong the obstacles yet to overcome: In the U.S. Democrats have said that the deal without changes won‚Äôt have their vote, nor will they allow a vote in Congress until Mexico changes its labour laws. In addition to these sticking points, Canada will not sign the deal so long as the U.S.-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs are in place.\n\"Let me be really clear that the USTR [United States Trade Representative] and Donald Trump mishandled this from day one. Had they just quickly passed a deal in 2017, signed an agreement between the three countries‚Ä¶ in early 2018, he had the Congress, he had the Senate, he had the Mexican government in place, and there were no elections coming up here,\" Heyman said.\n\"He could have passed it, scored a victory, and it's done. They messed up the clock. Second, they did not collaborate or communicate with unions, nor did they work with the Democrats. So now they find themselves in a position where the Democrats, and the unions in the United States have a different perspective,\" he said.\nHeyman said that Republicans have been pushing Trump to drop the tariffs, which were imposed by the U.S. last spring in the midst of NAFTA talks, citing national security concerns as their justification.\nCanada responded with its own dollar-for-dollar countermeasures on American steel, aluminum, and other goods. Canadian officials have already said these retaliatory measures would be lifted the minute the Americans dropped their tariffs, though the governing Liberals have been criticized by the opposition for not resolving the damaging trade action before inking the deal.\n\"I think he's in a really bad place on this deal,\" Heyman said of Trump.\nHeyman, who was joined by his wife Vicki on Sunday‚Äôs episode of CTV‚Äôs Question Period, also spoke at length about the pair‚Äôs newly-published book \"The Art of Diplomacy.\" The book details their time in Ottawa, which included being ‚Äúiced out‚Äù as then- U.S. president Barack Obama's representative in Canada, by the then-Stephen Harper government over the Keystone XL pipeline battle, and more.\n...‚Äù", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Skyprince27"}

{"cid": "Ugx9ZHE-AftYJvYpsRt4AaABAg", "text": "In August 1989, just two months after Trump launched his Trump Shuttle Airline, one of his Boeing 727s made a crash landing at Boston‚Äôs Logan International Airport.¬† The shuttle was to fly white-collar passengers between New York, Washington and Boston. The passenger jet had malfunctioning nose gear that failed to deploy. The nose and underbelly of the plane scraped and dragged along the runaway upon landing, with sparks flying. The pilots had to perform an emergency dumping of fuel to avoid a greater catastrophe. It's all on video.\nTrump purchased the airline for 365 million, and in 3 years, it never turned a profit.üòÑ\n\nAnd when Trump was asked by reporters about the crash landing in Boston, he said, and I quote: ‚ÄúIt was the most beautiful landing you‚Äôve ever seen.\" üò≤üò®\n\nBack in 1986 and likely for many years before, Trump colluded in tax evasion with¬†Bulgari Jewelry Store¬†in NY, a high-end posh location with tony clientele right out of¬†Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Here's how the scam worked:\n\nTrump would go into the store with his wife, his girlfriend, his...whatever (to use his vernacular). He would then buy her an expensive necklace or wristwatch. Normally, such a transaction would face the NY and state sales tax, which would be pretty high on luxury jewelry.\n\nIn an illegal attempt to evade the tax, Trump \"asked\" the store to instead ship the jewelry to an out of state location, where no NY sales tax could be collected. In fact, the store would merely send an empty jewelry box to the location, while Trump and his lady friends walked out the door with the jewelry that very day.\n\nThe state and city tax collectors eventually caught onto this scheme, and¬†Trump promptly testified¬†against his erstwhile tax evasion colluding partners at the jewelry store in order to save his own skin.üò≤ Anyone who gets close to a disease like Trump will end up getting pushed off a curb by him, and into an oncoming bus.\n\nThe empty box scam is just one example of Trump's history of illegal tax evasion. Another story can be told about his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida by local reporter¬†Frank Cerabino.\nTrump bought the property from the estate of breakfast cereal heiress Marjorie¬†Merriweather Post. He got it for a relative bargain at $7.5 million, something he bragged about in¬†The Art of the Deal. Yet he refused for years to pay local property¬†taxes on the actual value of the property, $11.5 million at the time he bought it. He tried to have it both ways--buy the property for a steep discount and also pay property taxes at¬†that same under-valued¬†level.\n\nTry that with your town's property tax assessor sometime and see what he says.üò≤", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "David J"}

That's the largest and most sustained manufacturing job growth since 1998...\nCritics of President Trump's tariffs say price increases on tariffed goods hurt \"downstream\" companies in metal-using industries that have to buy raw steel and aluminum. However, these same industries are now thriving and hiring workers more rapidly than the metal industries themselves.\n\nHow can that be?\n\nThe answer is that price increases are getting passed down the supply chain. And at the end of the chain, consumers are buying the goods because their incomes are rising.\n\nThis illustrates a fundamental fact of the U.S. economy: Many markets are made up of just a few sellers, and they all tend to raise prices together. In a growing economy, consumers who are feeling confident about the future simply pay the price increases...\n\nBy cutting taxes and embarking on deregulation last year, the Trump administration gave a boost to the economy. This is helping consumer incomes rise. At the same time, the tariffs are stimulating domestic U.S. manufacturing. So all boats are rising..\n\nTariffs work to deliver a boost to the U.S. economy in two ways. First, they make foreign goods more expensive, which shifts demand to American-made products. And second, they give industry a sense of confidence in the future...MAGA", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Tucker Carlson"}

I totally agree that its about time the tradebalance was regulated. The chinese is not only jerking of the americans, but ALL nations that follow WTO. The consensus is that tariffs and taxes should be avoided, but its generally accepted that you adjust tariffs in direct relation to tariff put on you. No more, no less. give or take. china has been allowed to bypass all international agreements. And objectively we did it becuase they deserved some progress and prosperity. But that was freaking 30-40 years ago it started. China do NOT need special treatment, and they shouldnt have it. its a matter of international balance as much as american balance.\n\n\nHowever, the increased workforce covers a dire truth. The reason for the hiring is the price. The biggest smelter in US is still down.. Its expensive to buy machinery, its cheap to hire labour, and you can always just fire them once you no longer need them. Its shows a low regard for people that are treatet as-- machines. The producers do NOT believe in the trend to a point where they invest. Theyre taking the cheapest route possible, and in that they make it look like things are great. But its partially inflated numbers, and the workers will be the loosers. No taxes means less education, less education means less salery, less salery means more paycheck-slaves and less who starts their own. It means less infrastructure and following a way more rigid work-environment where peeps are forced to stay where they are and accept the job they can get and not what they want.\n\n\nYea. peeps are better than machines, cus its cheaper when you fire them. You wont loose your investment as you would have if you had machines.. Thats the official mindset of the so called saviors\n\n\nCmon.. pay your taxes and then some. then peeps can get the qualifications to manufacture the machines used for manufacturing. they can become repair technicians or even be used in more important areas, like the manufacturing of goods needed for a green transition, they become flexible and mobile if not depending too much on a few dolleros. And most importantly - there would be an opening for higher wages for promoted workers, for workers in new branches. It wouldnt be just one umbrella category.. \"manufacturing jobs\" - I didnt look closer at where the numbers come from, but I have strong doubts its all related to heavy industry. The biggest smelter in US is still down, GM cloesd a shift and moved to mexico. Its limited how many big car producers theres left. and really.. hiring people for throw-away jobs is most likely just a strat like the \"bonus\" peeps got instead of the taxcut - it looks good and shiny, but when you dig deeper then its just more poop", "time": "3 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "martin winther"}

In his last two years in office,  Obama claimed that 2% growth was the best we could hope for. \nAnd in his last year in office, while the economy was again stalling out, Obama claimed that Trump's tax cuts and deregulation would only make things WORSE ....\n\nHe lied .... again \n\nBut now that we're in the midst of a Trump booming economy ‚Äî which kicked in AFTER  Trump reversed almost all Obama's economic policies...\nThe rate of GDP growth was decelerating in Obama's last year. \n\nIn Obama's last year, unemployment rate remained basically unchanged ‚Äî it was 4.9% in Jan 2016, and 4.8% when Trump took office in Jan. 2017. Now it's down to 3.9%...\n\nConsider that a survey of 68 business, financial and academic economists by The Wall Street Journal at the start of this year found that most believed Trump's policies would boost the economy, while the same group had said Obama's policies were a drag on long-term growth. Ninety percent said Trump's tax cuts would accelerate growth.   \nIt did.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Tucker Carlson"}

The final products that you buy will have these added to the price tag. Nothing will be much less, but painfully more. Maybe after few decades, things begin to be \"much less\", after all these efforts, anything made in USA will not be cheaper or higher quality than other countries.

Yes they are the biggest employer of part time workers who must get government benefits to help them. In fact Wal-Mart helps them with that. McDonald's is doing same thing with self order kiosks. The port of Los Angeles has already been affected by less imports. I am no fan of Chinese Government or how they do business. I watched with my family and friends, the break down of equipment packed and shipped to  China along with their jobs. I watched the fashion industry in Los Angeles be nearly wiped out by fast fashion, that is filling our landfills and oceans. We sent our dirty businesses overseas, instead of minding our ways. Globalization  means we as citizens loose control of our Microcosim to set examples of how to be better. Everybody crying about Chinese imports while the streets of most major cities in US are full of homeless, in all mental states, most unhealthy. The streets in Los Angeles and San Francisco are paved in human excrement and used needles. There are mothers in my neighborhood who are fearful to walk their children past homeless encampments to music class. Really the US can use less 99cent and Dollar General stores and more farmers markets. Long term jobs with any upward mobility, medical care, or pensions and are few or  non existent, it's a gig economy. We don't need Unions we need Fair wages from multinational corporations that make billions and never pay taxes in the US.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "SnarlaRae"}

I will post this here because you are familiar with my channel, this is what I posted about China in my group on MeWe where I still provide daily observations and updates. \n\nChina have played the \nlong game, they knew that as an insular, communist, agriculturally \ncentrist economy they could never build themselves into a super power \nthat could take on the west. So over the last 20 years they have played \nthe long game, they opened up their economy to the west and over time \nmade themselves the engine room of western economies.\nThey artificially inflated their growth by building empty \ncities and houses creating a mining boom in Australia. They offered up \ntheir cheap factory workers to western manufacturing companies luring \nthem to China and sending our \nwestern cities and towns who built themselves around these manufacturing\n industries broke and leaving the citizens dependent on welfare or low \npaid service industry jobs. They cornered the market in the cheap \nmanufacturing of everything so that we cannot even make ourselves a pair\n of shoes, EVERYTHING is made in China, in fact 70% of the goods for sale in Walmart are MADE IN CHINA.\nNow that they have successfully achieved their objective \nit is time for stage two of their strategy, slow their economy and bring\n the west to their knees. Because we are so reliant on the Chinese now \nto buy our mining resources and for their cheap products ie: They make \nour clothes, shoes, homeware, toys, electronics and gadgets when they \nstart to slow we are going to be brought to our knees economically too. \nIf Walmart don't have cheap products to sell American consumers it's \ngoing to affect their profit margin, if their profit margins are \nnegatively affected they're going to close stores and lay off workers. \nIt's not just a matter of returning to the days where we manufactured \nthese products ourselves (like the majority of Trump cultists believe) \nbecause we don't have a manufacturing industry to make anything anymore \nand it would take years to build them back up to the level to replace \neverything we have outsourced to China.\nLet's also not forget the MASSIVE amount of debt that the US are in to China or how badly they are already hurting the American agricultural industry by refusing to buy soybeans.\nThen with our markets crashing and our economy hemorrhaging they will strike, hard and fast, the blindside will be brutal.\n‚ÄúLet your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.\" ‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War\nUnfortunately the majority of people exist in normalcy \nbias because \"nothin happened yesterday, so nothin is gonna happen \ntomorrow\" however for the few who have their eyes open and can identify \nthe signs of westerners no longer feeling welcome in China or the latest headlines of China's economy slowing is just confirming what we've been preparing for.\n\"Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If his \nforces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, \nappear where you are not expected .‚Äù ‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War", "time": "3 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Thyalwaysseek"}
