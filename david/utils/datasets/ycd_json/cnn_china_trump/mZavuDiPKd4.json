Sometimes things may get rough for some but if you hang in there at the end we will succeed.  This particular problem  is very easy to fix. Trump should execute a presidential order and take all federal money from sanctuary cities, illegals on welfare ,like education, medical expenses etc and all the money to accommodate illegals and the lazy, and use the money to help farmers and the lobster guys keep their business running. At the same time keep hitting China with higher tariffs and press for ABC ( anywhere but china)  manufacturing policies.  until they realize they have to negotiate  or they will be decimated. The reality is that we can not let China keep screwing us in trade, stealing our technology and becoming a superpower like they did using American dollars. China is not the 70's underdeveloped country anymore which was asking for all the advantages in trade because of their poor economic conditions. Today China ( because the USA allowed and paid for it) became a super power and is now a threat economically and militarily to USA and the world.

The investigation was about Russian Interference (As stated clearly in the title had you read it) in the 2016 election.  As always,  Trump made it (the report) all about him.  IT'S A WITCH HUNT!

YOU PEOPLE (once again,  morons) are seeing him wipe his ass with the constitution and you're cheering him on for it.  He does nothing but lie lie lie. And you know he does. If you're not going to act like an American and respect the constitution,  then keep defending Trump.  YOU PEOPLE (lolz, I know) are setting a dangerous precedent.  Here's the TLDR; He committed crimes the special counsel wasn't able to prosecute because of DOJ policy,  and you're a moron for believing right wing politicians and news sources.

Seems the tariffs and instability has caused shoppers to shy away from buying new cars.  Who knew an extra 3 to 6 thousand dollars per vehicle would stall an industry??  To those who think \"So what, I buy used\", guess what, a stalled new car market causes increased ticket prices on used cars.  Called supply and demand.  More demand, higher price.\nTo the 40% who have had to rely on more credit this last 2 year's??\nTough shit if you voted for him.\nYou probably spent more time researching your new coffee maker than the guy you put in charge of IDK, everything?\nAnd the die hard \"but the stock market is going good\", you probably don't even invest there.  And history is a really good place to read about how a booming stock market one day turns into a bleak outcome the next.\nIf all that he has done was going to be the answer, it would have been done long before now.  This is a no plan, throw shit at the wall and hope something sticks management plan.\nWho knew??  The country has been run like a business all along.\nAnd now we have hired a manager who is going to bankrupt the business ( just like the golf course in Puerto Rico,  the airline business, the Trump university, and on and on).\nNext time you all vote, pretend you are looking for a new coffee maker and do a little research.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Cheryl Ernst"}

I remember just 14 years ago they used to be $7 to $10.  \n\n\nI like going to sea and wish I could go on a fishing expedition on a fishing trawler for a month at sea.  Yes, I know how much work those guys put into their jobs, providing food for us.  I appreciate fishermen and farmers very much.  I bet they sometimes feel unappreciated for what they do.

His staff are either in jail, indicted, quit, were fired, or incompetent morons. He's just flailing around and appears to be functionally illiterate.

We mined 767 million tons of coal in 2017 compared to 131 million POUNDS of lobster in 2016.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "TheOne WhoWelds"}

{"cid": "UgyhaDes9KH7sNrn_G14AaABAg.8vChEeblfRm8vGHAR5dw95", "text": "‚Äã@James Peter Btw, I hear crickets... No offense even though you lobbed insults at me.  You call me out on my comment \"letting china put extreme tariffs\" even though I admitted I meant to say \"keep\" not \"put\"  though I mean the search of that fact is so overwhelmed with Trumps tariffs/China it blocks out everything before the last president was elected for the most part. Try and find last presidents trade deals and it's .0001 percent of what actually happened however you can still find factual statistical data.  You asked for a source calling me a dummy.  Telling me to shut up until I post a source.  I mean you could google it but you chose not to.  Ignorance is bliss I guess?  The gist of your insults claimed I am clueless to reality. You said China never had extreme tax/tariffs on US exports into China and other things. So I re-found some of my sources to post because I go by facts (even though you should be using factual data and not opinionated emotional news no matter the source)  A news agency/media should not be able to convince you to believe something without factual data!\n\nI assume you thought I would quote right sided news sources like Fox or whatever else. That is not where I get my info from. I find actual sources that use real data/gathered statistical break downs. I like to use the CDC, FBI, WTO, NATO and numerous foreign/domestic/neutral agencies.  BTW idiots want to compare countries that have prosperity/less crime without acknowledging that those countries have 1/30th to 1/40th the population and their culture is completely different. Their boarders and surrounding countries are different so you need to take some foreign data with a grain of salt. \n\nThe gathered data I used to argue against your point breaks down in the simplest terms.  I mean just read the articles I posted that you said \"give sources\". It's very easy for me to find the other left news posts about many other topics before Trump was elected that statically/politically negate the emotional argument that spews most opinions . The most popular being about guns and immigration for instance (lots of people like to say Trump called all immigrants crossing rapists) without acknowledging that's not what he actually said. He said there are a lot of rapists/criminals crossing the boarder in reference to the innocent people crossing with them.  That's actually quoted in article published by a national organization for immigrant rights where left media such as the HuffPost wrote articles quoting the data which they said that illegal immigrants crossing the southern boarder are raped in high numbers around 75-85 percent.  Many of which are under age who are raped/molested by those smuggling them/those who are smuggled with them who are not good people. Saying that we need to do something about illegal immigration to stop this abuse.\n\nI decided to post some easy to understand and some things that are still easy to understand if you have a few classes of international trade/foreign policy under the belt.  Just a few typical common core credits one can choose when they get a BA.  Also I just want to point out you said he hasn't negotiated a single deal with anyone.  I just assumed you meant via a tariff/tax perspective.  If you mean in general I would be more than happy to \"post sources\" because you seem to be unable to find actual non partisan sources that shows facts. \n\nI side track as for other issues like gun laws which under Clinton ordered the DOJ to conduct a study. The ordered study found that millions of people prevent horrific crimes a year.  Under Clintons DOJ 2,500,000 were found to have prevented themselves from crimes not by using a firearm but by simply showing one. Crimes from assault, rape, kidnapping, murder (all degrees) robbery, molestation and the list goes one. I will say some experts say it's around 500,000 maybe 1,000,000 and the number is over estimated under Clintons DOJ gathering of data.  \n\nAs for the CDC and FBI the population in the USA is 330,000,00 there are 400,000,000 million fire arms.  I leave this part blank so you can call me a dummy/idiot/moron and I can say defend the data your insults.  Emotions are good when you can back them up.  \n\nIf that's hard for you I am more than happy to go into the unemployment/job creation or any other issue you have.  Educate yourself.  It's not some person on youtubes job to point out you are wrong.\n\nI don't agree with everything he does but the lefts move to allow all prisoners from rapists, murderers, pedophiles, terrorists to vote (because the left say it's their right).  They gave up that right when they did those horrific things.  They say eliminate the boarder and allow all illegals to vote (no country on earth including Canada, Mexico, and all South American countries have open boarder.  In fact Mexico deports illegals from their southern boarder in an instance until caravans started happening.  They tried to stop them but they knew it's not their problem in the long run.  They are just crossing through.. There are many videos where they interviewed people in Mexico and most said even though they don't like Trump Mexico has a zero tolerance for illegals that cross the boarder illegally.  They said Mexico has a boarder fence to prevent this so why is the idea of building a wall so different.  Also commenting there is are numerous reasons to protect a countries boarders.\n\n Redistributing wealth from the wealthiest people who created companies that make our lives easier not just in the USA but around the world.  Employ millions of people because of their innovation. Increasing government subsidies, eliminating ICE, controlling every single aspect of a persons life while pandering for votes and power seems crazy.  It is crazy.  It's not to benefit the people but to benefit those in power.  When you give free stuff to everyone and push more socialistic programs to a wider spread of people, call for reparations (how does one do that when millions of people upon millions immigrated to the USA 100 years after slavery which was terrible), say everyone should be allowed to vote and ill give you whatever you want to get my vote..   How idiots don't look at history or the clear manipulation to keep people down is crazy.  \n\nI have a plan that will create a utopia.  It just means you let me give you stuff while I control it all.  Fucking Moronic.", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "mrTabascohot"}
