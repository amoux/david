This demonstrate how tolerant, respectful, diligent, smart people are in China or in many asian countries.. Students surpass teachers knowledge or skill.

BUt why you dont see them famous all over the world or USA in particular??Cos being asians are being discriminated and bullied hard and long enough. You white people do not even give us any chance at all. neither does in Hollywood, do you see many Asian or chinese actors??very few. Asians work so hard in USA or all over the world ,especially in academic field. So that they could become medical doctors,scientist, researcher  lawyers, accountant. Why?? you guys dont give asians any chance at all. i have been teased, bullied(verbally and physically)  so many times that i could not even count, saying something can you really sing at karaoke  , can you really play basketball( the answer. not kidding.  I can sing similar to  DImash. Play like Jeremy Lin level. besides i speaks 6 languages. i can cook like a 5 star chef international food level, been to over 25 countries in the world).

{"cid": "UgxfC8wr3UO3UjkM1g54AaABAg", "text": "Recently, Steve Bannon has finally brushed up the sense of existence. The former US president's senior strategic adviser, who once known as the \"White House Master\", has been sighing and screaming around in August 2017, screaming at his sleazy Chinese clichés and trying to make a comeback. Now, when the US government once again lifted the tariff bar on China, Bannon seems to feel the opportunity to come. He took the opportunity to concoct a long article and confessed from six aspects that \"China has become the biggest enemy of the United States.\" In this \"economic war\" with China, we must compromise with the tariffs.\r\n\r\nA closer look at the so-called six aspects of evidence supported by Bannong can be described as logical confusion and ridiculous conclusions. It is simply unbearable, and it feels that he has become mad and suffering from snoring.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bannon accused China of having been engaged in “economic warfare” with industrial democracies. The fact is that China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative has built the world’s largest platform for sharing, sharing and sharing, and has become the world’s most popular public product. . For another example, he claimed that the US-China trade dispute is a \"fundamental conflict\". The United States insists on tariffs, is full of extreme militant thinking, ignores the historical lessons of \"the trade war has no winners,\" and violates global public opinion. In addition, he attacked China's \"theft\" and \"plundering\", and it was unfounded and unfounded. Because in 2017, China's domestic patents, trademarks, industrial designs and other types of intellectual property applications ranked first in the world. In 2018, China's innovation index ranked among the top 20 in the world, ranking 17th, up from last year. 5 digits. China has become one of the world's largest intellectual property owners. How come \"stolen\"?\r\n\r\nBannon’s most hostile remarks are that he slanders China’s desire to become a “global hegemon” and reflects its deep-rooted hegemonic thinking. At the Asian Civilization Dialogue Conference, which opened on Wednesday (15th), Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out in his keynote speech that \"friends and good neighbors and peace and harmony are the consistent way of life of Chinese civilization.\" President Xi has repeatedly Public announcements at home and abroad firmly stated that no matter which step is taken, China will never seek hegemony and never expand, and will never impose the tragic experience that it has experienced on other nations. The concept of \"community of human destiny\" put forward by President Xi Jinping is to express China's joint development with all countries, common security, governance, joint participation, and shared results. This feeling and responsibility of \"taking the world as the public\" is difficult or deliberately unwilling for American politicians who pursue \"American priority\", only my own respect, narrow and selfish.\r\n\r\n(Infographic: Steve Bannon Photo credit: China News Service) (Infographic: Steve Bannon Photo credit: China News Service)\r\nIn the face of the facts, Bannon’s confusing lie is like a broken soap bubble, which is surprising but only a ridiculous and generous. However, some of the far-right politicians in the United States, represented by Bannong, have fallen into the filth of China, but they have the potential to return to the ghost of \"McCarthyism\" in the 1950s. The American politicians who promoted the alternative right-wing movement are self-satisfied, threatening the core decision-making level, pursuing xenophobia, shaping China into a scapegoat, and arguing the normal economic and trade friction between the United States and China into an irreconcilable conflict of values ​​and civilization. I even want to have a war between the United States and China immediately to satisfy their lust and ambition to gain more space for political activities.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that just this Wednesday (15th), some US senators announced that they have submitted a bill to Congress to prohibit the issuance of visas to the United States for personnel working or sponsored by Chinese military research institutions to reduce the so-called \"US security risks.\" On the same day, the White House also announced that the country has entered a \"state of emergency\", prohibiting US companies from using telecommunications equipment produced by companies that pose a danger to national security. It is widely believed that the intention of this move is that Huawei’s intention is very obvious.\r\n\r\nIn today's economic globalization, the United States, the world's most developed country with super-scientific technology, military and economic strength, is so savage, and the sense of security is so bad that it is really unbelievable to shut the door to the world. Fighting against the enemy is easy, except for the heart. In fact, the only thing that can defeat the United States is itself. Right now, the new right wing that jumps in the United States, holds the \"zero-sum\" game and the old thinking of power politics is the real enemy of the United States. The American people should be vigilant about this new \"McCarthyism\" represented by Bannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Xi Jinping once vividly said that protectionism is like turning himself into a dark room. It seems to have escaped the wind and rain, but it also isolates the sun and the air. Right now, what makes the world feel sad is that under the clamour and shackles of the \"bannons,\" the United States is closing the black house more and more tightly, waiting for it or will be self-suffocating.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Fakenewspatrol 007"}

When they have very bad track records (they have declared at least 13 wars with so much bloody killings since WWII, although they called themselves as the \"democratic country\") they condemn others about \"human right violations\". When their media, their government and their markets have been controlled by the interest groups they endlessly remind other countries to follow the rules of \"free speech\", \"democracy\" and \"free market\". When they consume so much cheaper \"Made in China\" in their daily life and their country borrowed so much money from China they say China is just a copy-cat and would collapse soon ... funny, isn't it? Actually, the biggest American threat or enemy is America itself, neither China, nor Russia or other countries.

Companies like Apple, produced in China, sold to the United States, counted as China's surplus. If you only want to reduce the surplus, you should limit companies like Apple to enter China. Ford also has several manufacturing plants in China. If Chinese people buy Ford cars in China, they will not buy Ford cars imported from the United States. This is not good for reducing the surplus. Of course, it is undisputed that companies like Apple Ford entering China helped China increase employment. In this Sino-US trade negotiation, the United States hopes that China will liberalize restrictions on entering the Chinese production market. For example, the proportion of shares should be liberalized, and the market cannot change technology. If this aspect is put more open, the future trade surplus will be even bigger.

{"cid": "Ugx6yVIkrBd7prFtuy54AaABAg", "text": "Formal complaint against Tung Wah hospital F2 ward and Happy Valley police \nJune 26, 2018\nIt is purely due to negligence on the part of the Tung Wah hospital that my mother was indirectly murdered by Tung Wah hospital F2 ward !!!   My mother had been feeling unwell for 3 days and on Saturday night - June 9, 2018 she was really in bad shape !!!   \n\nAccording to my brother, my mother had problem breathing on Thursday, June 7.  When I saw my mother evening of June 8, she did not look good and her mouth was watering a bit, she was given a square lump of rice which she said she could not eat, but one woman talked like as if she was in the market and said the language therapist prescribed she could only eat this !!!  We had to cook our own food or buy something she could eat !!!    After insisting, she finally gave her a bowl of oatmeal but came back a few minutes later saying this is forbidden and wanted to take back the bowl of oatmeal !!!  After such unnecessary harrassment my poor mother simply could not have any appetite any more !!!   When the time for visiting expired, I went to the counter and asked to see Dr Cheng.  The nurse who spent almost an hour demanding me to leave the F2 ward about a week ago said I must state reason for seeing the doctor.  I told her Dr. Cheng made appointment to want to see me but she did not turn up, since my mother's conditions were bad, I wanted to follow up with her.  The nurse repeated three times if necessary, the doctor would contact me.  I reinterated Dr. Cheng made appointment but she did not turn up and since my mother was not feeling well, I would like to contact her and talk to her.  At last the nasty nurse said she would make a note !!!  \n\nWhen I stepped into the room on Saturday, June 9, I was shocked to see my mother's seating posture although I could not see her face -  the impression I got was she was in bad shape.  When I walked close to her bed, I felt extremely sad because she did not seem to have any energy, her bibs were dirty but she could not eat or drink at all !!!  I noticed her already very thin face shrunk even further, it looked as if her skin was stuck to her bones only, the little flesh on her face seemed to have disappeared compared with the day before, her forehead was wrinkled in pain, she could not sit still and was shifting from left to right feeling very uncomfortable !!!  \n\nI could not help bursting into tears and went to the counter, I repeatedly told the nurses in tears and asked to see the doctor, three of them sat close together and were doing nothing but just chatting.  Without even checking, they still said nothing was wrong and my mother was better off than many others in the room.  They said a lot of patients could not even eat by themselves but my mother could sit and eat by herself !!!  Meantime my youngest brother came and I pointed out to him the symtoms I noticed on my mother's face.  After coming back from the washroom, the three of them disappeared already and later my brother told me one nurse drove them away simply because she said they were causing inconvenience by standing round my mother, although visiting time had not expired  !!!   F2 ward is the only room with 2 hours, while the normal visit hours are 3 for all other wards !!!   Around 8:30pm I asked to stay a bit longer and was \"granted\" another half an hour !!!   \n\n\nI could not sleep the whole night because I was so worried and at around 5:30am on June 10 I called my mother's mobile and there was no answer !!!  At 5:42am a woman from Tung Wah called asking us to rush to the hospital as my mother's heart beat was dropping !!!   When I arrived at Tung Wah F2 ward my mother was indirectly murdered already !!!  None of us could see my mother off !!!   I was furious and demanded a thorough investigation !!!    After my mother was taken away from F2 ward I went back to ask for an appointment to see the doctor, it is unbelievable that the nurse sitting at the counter replied in a very cold and indiffernt tone even after my mother was indirectly murdered by them !!!   I was informed later the appointment with Dr. Cheng was at 1pm on June 11 at F2 ward !  \n\n\nThere was a female head of nurse by surname Chan with Dr. Cheng.  Dr. Cheng said she was surprised to hear my mother gone because my mother was supposed to have recovered and should leave that place a few days later !!!   When Dr. Cheng started talking about the medical issues I immediately interrupted by telling her my observations during the last couple of days and it is ONLY common sense that my mother was obviously and definitely indirectly murdered due to pure negligence for three days !!!  When asked when they discovered my mother was in danger, Dr. Cheng said around 12:30 am on June 10, and someone called us around 1:00 am \"according to the report\" she had on hand.  We told Dr. Cheng none of us received any call from F2 ward !!!  The first call was 5:42am !   When asked exactly when my mother had her last breath, Dr. Cheng said around 6:40 am, but my second brother immediately said he rushed to F2 ward in a taxi and arrived prior to that time but my mother was already gone !!!  I cannot believe such important and crucial points in the \"report\" Dr. Cheng was reading can be WRONG  !!!   What else in the so-called \"report\" can we take seriously !!!", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Fiona Ching"}

For the Chinese communists, they might mean the end of their regime.\nThe adverse effects of trade wars on the US will be ameliorated and perhaps eliminated by the GREATEST OIL STRIKE IN HISTORY in the Permian Basin of Texas, the benefits of which can be compounded many times over by an American Canal more than twice the size of Panama's between Brownsville and San Diego.\nAmerica will be more the \"Middle Kingdom\" than China ever was.\nUpon Trump's election, federal lands were opened to oil exploration that had been blocked by the queer bastard communist Quisling pretender Barack Hussein Obama II d.o.b. 4 August 1961.\nQuickly thereafter came the GREATEST OIL STRIKE IN HISTORY, on federal lands in the Permian Basin.\nAnd soon, within a year or so, the United States became a net oil exporter for the first time in many years. Return of the petrodollar, this time on the basis of American oil, not Saudi Arabian.\nHardly anybody noticed these events or their implications, certainly not the dumbasses in the mass media, maybe not even Steve Bannon.\nMoreover, many other countries might be encouraged by America's example to stand up to China's unfair and predatory commercial practices. The \"trade war\" has never been strictly between China and the US, but rather between China and the rest of the world. The same is true of freedom of navigation on the high seas. China is making itself a pariah.\nThe Chinese people might conclude their rulers have lost the \"Mandate of Heaven”.\nNot that this will happen overnight.", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "Albert Moore"}

We are, currently, in a very good position in the west but with every passing year our position weakens and we will soon reach a crossing point where, if we don't act, there will be no return and we will fall so far behind China and Asia that we will be consigned to the history books as once great nations. I want to see the whole world prosper, including China, but that prosperity should not be at our own expense. This is not a zero-sum game. We have a lot of strengths in the west and we need to start using those to our advantage and start a new process of rapid technological development and progress. We need massive deregulation to allow for this rapid development and we also need to change some of our laws to allow for new industries to grow and flourish, such as scrapping drug laws which would end so many social problems associated with organised crime, save billions from the failed war on drugs and also generate billions in revenue and taxes which would otherwise line the pockets of cartels and terrorist groups. We need to regain peoples confidence in the system of free-market capitalism and so long as the war on drugs continues I think we will be unable to convince people that we are on the right path as it stands as a huge contradiction and actually undermines everything politicians say about freedom.

First Trump does NOT own one successful business He does NOT own a single business that he can claim he own's that has made money for it's investors  maybe you heard about it recently . Where trumps success come's from is the amount of Cash he yank's out for the use of his name then he flee's on to the next project ..but what is  always left behind is a huge Mountain of debit  that whoever is still connected to the property then owes , It's exactly what  Huge Mall developers do which is why ALL mall's fail and certainly after 20 yrs because they are intentionally designed to have a good 20 yr lifespan  after that they usually become an eye sore or State Or County property because they no longer produce the tax revenue  they need to stay viable . Trump is by definition the great NY Real estate  Con man ...and anyone who has ever worked for any of the hundreds of sub contractors can attest  NOT one of them has ever been paid what they were owed .. They are 100% of the time  made an offer to pay so much on the dollar and that is always much much less than was owed now you might think well Gee wiz that's good business right ? WRONG  Sub contractors don't have vast profit margins they work out to great pay if all goes according to plan but they Bid on Trumps Jobs Trump hires a sub contractor has his lawyer sign the contract on the agreed price then they flat out defraud the sub contractor and you know what he say's when you tell him you need to get paid your men have family's ask him He tell's them to do what Walmart employees do get on food stamps then say's  Take me to court and  in 5 yrs when trumps  lawyer are finished postponing it and your broke they will settle for 30 cents on the dollar and say good bye but by that time the sub contractor has defaulted on his debit from the Trump job . and that is how Trump get's every building he has had anything to do with built .

In fact, some Chinese patriots even want Trump to be re-elected.The reason is simple. In Chinese culture, there has always been a saying that \"a real bully is better than a hypocrite\". In fact, over the past 30 years, the U.S. government has been openly and secretly hostile to China and has imposed a technological blockade. If you don't understand, you just need to check the U.S. Pacific strategy. Trump was the first person to bring the issue to the table. Despite the same hostility, the Chinese were better able to cope with his policies. Simply put, this person's ability is not very smart!More importantly, Trump began the American self-destructive model. He imagined too many imaginary enemies and set up too many genuine hostilities for the United States. This makes the Chinese people see the opportunity to become a real power in the future!His series of policies, just for some small visible interests, completely abandoned the United States as the foundation of the first power - credibility! That may be the most important thing Americans really lose. Countries around the world are beginning to stop believing in American mythology and to realize that the United States is not so reliable and no longer trusts.

Venezuela has a military too busy trying to control its own population, one put into poverty by bad trade deals made with Russia by their leaders in an effort to save their economy. They are burning down the house to keep warm. India is looking at an emerging importance in its region and seeks neutrality with strength. China is already testing it across the Himalayan frontier and by supporting Pakistan. China for all of its bluster would barely bring Russia as a prospective ally to USSR levels. Russia's Putin is not stupid either, that smiling Chinese Premier Xi may also have long term designs on his country as well. Hitler's betrayal of Tripartite Pact with the USSR in Operation Barbarossa of 1941 is a lesson no Russian President will likely ever forget. China has violated Russian border territory in the past. Once, in 1969, Chinese troops invaded Soviet Russia in an effort to steal a disabled T-62 tank for the purpose of copying it. More than 80 Soviet soldiers were killed in that skirmish.

My grandfather was a historical author. He has books in the Library of Congress. I don't like the smiling on the Chinese Premiere either. Gives me the heebee jeebees. Seeing Chinese officials being protected by the Secret Service lately really irked me. It made me angry actually. A disgusted low-boiling kind of anger. I know we provide visiting dignitaries security, but I don't like it. We should change that law. Maybe they would stop \"visiting\" \"negotiating\" and \"spying\" all together. So sick of Communism, Islam and Globalism wrecking the world and our Republic. A majority of illegals that are captured sneaking over the border are chinese too. They are not all innocents. I'm all for a physical barrier/wall and Congress to change our immigration laws. Trade needs to slow down so we can police our legal border crossings better also. I think Pres. Trump doesn't want trade or the economy to slow down so he wont do it. We need to stop the enemies from within and not let illegal entry anywhere on any of our borders. It can be done. This lying hypocritical Congress will do nothing. Best bet would be to declare a National Emergency where the President controls all the troops. Suspend UN visas and kickout all UN diplomats. Take away the right of foreign ownership in America with no exceptions. No foreign lobbyists...it sickens me the left attacks Wallstreet but ignores K street where the real money is creating so much corrupted influence. Anywho, I hope our leaders learn from History and are blessed with much wisdom moving forward. I would like to learn more about the different tribes of Islam, and the country of Pakistan. I wish our country had never sold the Shah of Iran nuclear power to begin with.", "time": "18 hours ago", "author": "MONICA LYNN"}

We have all broken God's moral law - the 10 commandments. This is also why we need Jesus Christ as our personal Savior. Can I ask you some questions my friend? How many lies have you told in your life? What do we call someone who tells lies? A liar. Have you ever stolen something? What do we call someone who steals? A thief. Have you ever taken God's name in vain (omg)? God said He will not hold harmless those who misuse His name. Jesus said if a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart then he's already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you ever looked with lust my friend? This is just 4 out of the 10 commandments that we have broken. Since we have broken God's moral law, we deserve to be separated from God forever in hell. But God in His love sent His Son Jesus to die for my sin and your sin my friend. To have your sins forgiven and have eternal life place your faith in Jesus just like you would a parachute when having to jump out of an airplane at 30,000 feet. You can't just believe in the parachute you have to place your faith in it by putting it on. After you pray to receive Jesus read John 3 and 4. Then read the Bible every single day of your life no matter what and also pray that God will help you understand what you read. Please, please, please think about this my friend. Judgment is coming and this is how you get prepared.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Scott Whitley"}

It's classic Saul Alinsky Rules for Radicals, #RULE 12: \"Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”\r  This follow-on description of this particular Rule comes from another website (originally from Glenn Beck):\n\n\n*  Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)\n\n\nTrouble is, China's leadership is steeped in communism.  Alinsky's \"Rules\" are for socialism.  Thus, they are rookies in using such tactics, unpolished.  They look buffoonish.  Against a classic US political figure (of either party)?... sure, this tactic might work, as most politicians have the spine of a wet noodle.  \n\n\nBut not Donald Trump, nor Steve Bannon.  Both men possess a blue collar mentality (yes, even Trump with his millionaire father, who btw forced young Donald to do yeoman's work as a young man to gain a respect for such work).  With such a background,  I suspect the two clashed in the White House, BUT I think both men have the same vision.  What's more, they've both had it for a long time. In fact, Trump has been offering hints towards this for 40 years now.  To wit, go back and look at his interview with Rona Barrett in 1980 where she innocently yet extemporaneously asked Donald, \"You sound like you might run for President.  Will you?\"  He responded earnestly (paraphrasing), \"No, I think there are other people better suited for that job. BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY.\"  Trump repeated this message over the next 15-20 years in several other celebrity interviews, including no less than with Oprah Winfrey herself.  Plus, by the time he got to the Oprah interview he added a kicker statement: \"BUT IF IT GOT BAD ENOUGH, THEN YES, I WOULD RUN FOR POTUS.  WHAT'S MORE, I THINK I'D HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT WINNING.\"  \n\n\nWell, it got bad enough, and Trump was true to his word, especially on the \"winning\" part.  Bannon, having served both as a US Naval officer in hotly contested areas of the globe AND as an investment banker, had the opportunity to observe global things from a rather unique, inside perspective:  from the \"boots on the ground\" viewpoint to the financing of things that, ahem, all seemed to route back to China. \n\n\nSo, good luck to the Chinese communist - or totalitarian mercantilist, as Steve calls it - leaders if they want to fight Steve Bannon.  He's more than up to the task.  He knows their \"game\" and he's calling them out on it.  The MAGA movement is not just about Trump or America; look what's happening in Europe with Brexit in Great Britain.  Plus, consider the Yellow Vests in France.  Look at the Russian manipulations in Austria just this week.  Reform is afoot globally, and it's all pushing back against China and it's (greedy) manipulations.  And that's where Steve Bannon is, right in the thick of it, a beacon of clarity in the booms and rumbles of an economic war.  What's more, I think he's able to help Trump more from the outside than from inside the White House.  He's not constrained by governmental etiquette and protocol rules.  He can free-wheel as he pleases.  \n\n\nMake no mistake: Trump and Bannon are both on the same side.  And together, they provide a one-two punch that the Chinese never saw coming.

China is not a partner, it is a predator bent on domination, and destruction if necessary. We simply cannot trust China. While at the same time, we have the means of manufacturing our own goods and dealing with other countries.

Obama himself stated that the past days of good paying manufacturing jobs was behind us and we were not going to get it back. He poured more money than Bush into the economy and spent twice as much. After eight years our economy was still stagnant. Quit rewriting history for Obama and your own conscious. None of the current recovery had anything to do with Obama. Trump has brought back a lot more manufacturing than what has been publicized. Returning manufacturing back to our country however will require a lot more work due to the regulatory obstacles we have created. It’s coming though. By the way, quit accepting the stealing as “a tax” we have to pay.", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "Troy Ezell"}
