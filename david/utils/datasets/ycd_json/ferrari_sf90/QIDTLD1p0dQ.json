How about bringing in a current engineer and aerodynamist (from aeronautics) to talk knowledgeably about the cars, instead of 'guess artists'?

The thinner tyres were brought only because of your mediocre hero who even with a fastest cr couldn't beat Seb. Now after the testing, and Pirelli confirming that tye 2019 tyres are actually the same tyres, your mediocre hero is still slower than Vettel and Leclerc because he is just mediocre and low-IQ. I wonder what happens when Seb and Charles expose his mediocre ass even on special tyres, what will be his excuse? Perhaps he'll ask to add ballast to Ferrari, or having them banned. Boy there has never been a a mediocre driver like your hero in the history of F1. Ham the sham is just not good enough or intelligent enough to win on his own. He needs team order just to beat someone like Bottas. Your mediocre low-IQ hero gonna be doing so much crying this year because he'll have his low-IQ and mediocre ass handed to him by a rookie and Seb. #IWANTSPECIALTYRES #IAMMEDIOCRE #AVERAGE #UNWORTHY", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Remi R"}
