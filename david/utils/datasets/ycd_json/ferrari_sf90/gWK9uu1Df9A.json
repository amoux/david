At Ferrari all the above things bring more pressure. \n\nIn short i think it's a tough year for charles leclerc and vettel isnt that bothered. I actually don't think vettel is that sensitive to pressure. His style always been agressive, bordering stupid sometimes. But if you're close to the wdc you lose it at those moments. \n\nI bet you can go back through the years for vettel and find the same kind of reckless incidents in every season.  I see that more as Vettel not giving a fuck. Also a luxury that leclerc doesn't have.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "mstrchf 123"}
