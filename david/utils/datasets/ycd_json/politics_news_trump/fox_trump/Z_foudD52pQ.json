Now I get to take some time and really enjoy the little Red piggies squeal. What we are seeing, and the leftists don't understand, is this is the awakening of that Sleeping Giant, as Japanese Admiral Yamamoto called us after the attack on Pearl Harbor. This time that awakening was quiet as a mouse and far exceeded my wildest dreams of applying the freedom of thought, cunning and the most superb of self discipline. By electing a President and control over Congress, American conservative Patriots have declared the onset of The Second American Revolution. Not by force of arms, but by due process of law and never compromising American values. \n\nAs this psychological war proceeds to regain control over our government and society, the leftists will be in constant confusion feeling they are fighting a ghost that is spreading across America. It's somewhat like our first Revolution that was known for using Indian guerilla tactics to pick off the enemy. This has to be a very delicate Revolution because the leftists have assaulted our young for over two generations. We need to earn their trust and respect and faith that America is not lost. Being a Baby Boomer devoted to our Democracy, for 5 decades I have so painfully watched the leftists take control and assault everything that is decent and beautiful about our Democracy. My generation has betrayed the young and thrown them to the leftist wolves and now is the time to correct our mistakes and selfishness. \n\nAs we learn to correct our mistakes in the last 50 years and rebuild our national pride and tremendous responsibility to reinstall our moral values, we will see the leftists self destruct.They have no moral compass at all, their strategy is simply to weaken our society by spreading the most filthy perversions and selfish obsessions. The latest absurdity they are calling \"ecosexual\" in their effort to produce even more insane freaks. We value human life and the individual and it's easy to see they are the exact opposite. They don't even know common decency and caring about others. After WWII, we were well on our way to really building our Democracy and the most wonderful way of life, now we are back on track. This is our rebirth and nothing on earth can stop it. Just watch as the leftists turn on their Marxist mentors. I wonder when Katy Perry starts writing patriot songs and expressing hate for Clinton as the traitor and criminal heads toward her new home, a federal prison.\n\nWelcome to the New World of rights, freedom, liberty, fraternity, equality and justice. It's a long road ahead to build this dream, but it will happen.\n\nThomasÔªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "td fisk"}

We almost stopped Syria being United people's of the world.  \n\nOnly the elite punished us for it and we let them. playing straight back into their hands. But looking back thinking I know it's weird. \n\nThe euro people's punishment for denying war. \n\nISIS flooding Europe with immigrants. \n\nISIS itself.  We know who trained ISIS supplies ISIS and who are in bed with ISIS in the box room hidden under the stairs. Turrrkey. Turkey sells ISIS goods to the west and sells them goods from the west. Connected to the Saudi which is connected to the west.  \n\nUsa was punished with greater threat alerts on every news channel. Mass immigration from the south. Now trump? but mayb not trump.  \n\nRussia was punished the most obvious for siding with Syria and it's been punished ever since. \n\nThe vicky nuland (nunland?) story blew that open and our news stations hid it. I saw it all over RT but on UK news nothing.  Then one night early hours I finally saw a short segment on the story to confirm it. Although Google searches already proved it.  \n\nRussia hit out by releasing the recording they'd secretly obtained.  Cold war style. \n\nPlease trump don't follow the trend and keep backing Russia into a corner it's not good for us. None of us or our economies only the elite benefit. I bet they are cashing in the stock market right now just like Brexit.  Billions made the day Brexit was won. By who tho. \n\nI prefer to think Trump is just incredibly rich and butt hurt he wasn't welcome amongst the elite.  So he's gonna fight them instead.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "BANNED Again"}

You had been voted into high offices of state, and the donations were flowing in, but not quickly enough, you had to completely forget what you had been elected for. So the stupid people, who you thought had been permanently mollified with television game shows and plentiful burrito coverings, have risen up and elected the greediest stupid person they could find. Even if constitutional limits prevent the worst immediate effects, it's a race to the bottom now. Nobody digs in their heels like morons. And the bar has been lowered for stupid people around the world to do the same. But it was you that set the example, you who devalued truth, you who taught them not to help each other, you who turned education back into a luxury.

I can not in good conscious even dismiss Trump voters as crazy. Real Clear Politics shows many polls all over the place from her up plus 12 to him up 1. \nNormally anytime we see this it is right or left pollsters deliberately using methodology to get the results they want, but I think this is different. It is very possible that those polls could all be accurate as a reflection of a candidate saying something and a person thinking that settles it and then the next day the other one does something equally bad. \nThe real wild card here is wikileaks - Jullian hates her and believes she would have him killed something I consider unlikely but not to be ranked as just a crazy conspiracy theory.Looking at the way it has unfolded so far I will be shocked if we are not about to learn something of mammoth proportions on Clinton's side.\nThe reason is because he ( I think) is deliberatly bashing her door one day at a time and 16 days out we get the first evidence of perjury! That speaks volumes to me. I could be wrong but I it looks like a solid strategy to destroy her by not letting up every day while Trump gets pounded all in one day and then it dies out!!! It is going to be super interesting to see if this plays out like the way I expect, with Jullian relentlessly releasing new daming evidence increasingly more damaging until the day of the election.\nLike ¬∑ Reply ¬∑ Oct 23, 2016 5:03pmÔªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Murray Flewelling"}
