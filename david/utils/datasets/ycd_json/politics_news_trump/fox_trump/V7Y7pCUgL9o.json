Then it is a contract where politicians can go their own way after being elected. Nowadays you see politicians having their own solution which is contrary to the needs of the confronting people. Where are the actions of rational consumers to punish the deviant behavior of elected and sworn advocates who are undergoing a diametrical change in their attitude? In my view, these figures eventually become regents with separate diaries with their own interests that they pursue. According to my views, that must be a huge problem when leaders from a party play a leading role. I describe this as a form of treason. In the end, such a tricycle leads to a coup that no one is waiting for. In my opinion, it would be advisable to introduce more time for the local residents, stakeholders and large groups of people to come to a better solution for existing problems. Nowadays, the dream of large groups of politicians goes so far as to develop a whole new world order outside of their electorate's will, with little future for its inhabitants. According to my opinion, a social contract should no longer be silent with the elected. Beforehand, the representative who wants to be elected should be able to demonstrate on the basis of which this choice should fall within his program. The proposed programs should be calculated by a reliable statistics agency that can show whether or not the program is made of baked air and can or can not be made payable. In other words, where will the affordable resources be obtained?﻿", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "Arnold Tjauw-A-Hing"}

In other words, none of the hawks in DC are willing to realize that the only way to peace is to accept NK as a nuclear state and limit some of it's other military options.  Trump even said: he's willing that NK keep some nukes in exchange for a limit on their ballistic missiles.  Remember, nukes are useless without a delivery system.  But Pompeo and others want \"complete denuclearization\" which anyone with a brain knows will not happen... Sadam Hussein and Muammar Ghadaffi would still be around if they had nukes, and Kim knows that.  Both he and his father have devoted enormous time and money to providing NK with an effective nuclear deterrent against the United States, which requires the ability to strike the American homeland. He may make all sorts of other deals, but he will never give that up.\r\n\r\nNorth Korea doesn’t need to match U.S. nuclear capabilities – the ability to deliver only a few nuclear weapons on American soil would be a sufficient deterrent.  There is no deal available that would protect North Korea from U.S. nuclear weapons, since they can reach the North directly from the United States. No amount of local disarmament – the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, even the withdrawal of American nuclear weapons from all of East Asia – could change that reality, and the United States is not planning to abolish its strategic nuclear deterrent.\r\n\r\nThe only safe road to the future, therefore, is a political deal that greatly reduces tensions between the two countries while acknowledging that a state of mutual nuclear deterrence will henceforward prevail between them.\r\n\r\nMutual deterrence is what has now obtained for a long time between the United States and its two peer rivals, Russia and China. The huge asymmetry between the power of the U.S. and North Korea does not lead to a different conclusion. Nuclear weapons are the great leveller: in practical terms, just a few are enough to deter, even if the other side has hundreds of times as many (which the United States does).\n\n\nThe kind of concessions that could help include a gradual relaxation of the sanctions that stifle the North Korean economy and a formal peace treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean War, perhaps in return for very big cuts in North Korea’s huge conventional army (twice the size of South Korea’s, in a country with half the population).\r\n\r\nLater on, there could be talks about permanently capping the number of North Korean nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles (which is still in the dozens, not the thousands), in return for withdrawing some or all of the U.S. troops from South Korea.\n\n\nProblem is, few Americans are ready yet to accept that this is the logic of the situation.﻿", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "Paul Posilovic"}

If you are okay with the 2016 election results then of course you are fine with 2018 - the most diverse representation of America in the House of Representatives. A truly historic election result with the margin of seats won, candidates, and the electorate coming out like never before during midterms, bigger than the GOP in 1994 and Tea Party/GOP in 2010. Democracy thrives when voters participate in the process. Even if Trump committed multiple crimes and more comes out about his unethical and shady practices before and during his presidency I think Congress should not impeach him. Gather the facts. Do their jobs of oversight which use to be a thing before Donnie came along. And present it to the American people. The 2020 election will take place with full transparency and the people will elect their choice. Simple. After 2 years of this presidency the result was a historic midterm that changed the balance of power in Washington D.C. and some of the same people that voted for Trump helped flip the House and take over almost half the state houses and governorships. So...that base is shrinking and only in their closed minds they don't see the warning signs. Trump could have been so much better at representing the country with dignity, respect, and compassion. He could have healed a nation. It was never meant to be. Don the Con did a number on so many people and they have lived through these last 2 years wondering if this is a bad dream. If they choose another 4 years of this madness and embarrassment in 2020 then we can no longer say it was the Russians, bribes and felony payments to a porn star and playmate, or that voters didn't know exactly who they were voting for and how he ran his businesses and interacted with foreign governments as an asset. Everything will be known. In the open. We are Americans before we are republicans or democrats. The United States of America will choose and they will live with this decision, along with the generations to follow, knowing this experiment with democracy was never completed. The founding fathers were striving for a more perfect union and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. God bless and keep you and yours for all eternity and may God bless these United States of America.               Cheers﻿", "time": "16 hours ago", "author": "jdsthird"}

The Dems sense it and some know it so they're going to try and get the sleazy disbarred lawyer to bad mouth and denigrate Trump so they can cast Trump in the worst light possible. The only agenda now that Dems know that they've got no smoking gun on the Russian collusion with nothing substantive to corroborate the allegation is an unhinged 100% effort to make him look as bad as possible against the losers that MSM and Dems are touting.

When giving their assessment of Iran’s nuclear ambitions they clearly said  Iran had stopped its research and pursuit of nuclear weapons. That’s due to the deal your boy pulled out of. It was the best when he said a live televised Senate intelligence committee where the heads of each department spoke was fake news. Nothing at all was accomplished besides them having a good dinner. And if you watched the first summit trump said NK would immediately start the process of denuclearization. I watched senate intel briefing live on fox and these summits.

I liken it to what the dem socialists are trying to do to America. It all about money/power in politics. There's where you can usually find most of your answers. The UN and the dems both are basically trying to figure out a way to steal the wealth of the U.S. but the problem with that is what do you do when its gone? We could never compete with China or the rest of the world once the wealth is depleted. Russia and China would for sure rule the world when that happens. I'm sure Trump didnt make a deal because N Korea has other interests besides the U.S. like every other nation and thats why he said realistically it takes time but he said he would not lift the sanctions till an agreement was made. We will see. Whats dems in America fail to realise is that the world is a competitive place. Probably why they love their \"participation\" trophys. Its not really that hard to understand that if you can get cheap labor and make alot more money in another country that is where your business will find itself if its successful. That is what these poor trade agreements have cost America thus the sanctions. That way you stop China from having all the advantages and make it a \"fairer\" playing field. Look at the U.S. economy now. You see any complaints from Ameticans about that? No. What you get from the left is that Obama should be credited. I could care less where the credit goes but my point is its doing well and tarriffs are a big reason. Europe is mad that Trump is asking them to pay their fair share to the UN so the main stream news (which is very left leaning) reports negative about Trump and his relationship with Europe when in fact if you listen to Europeans on here they all (mostly) say they wish he was their president and they know if he had not been elected that the chaos over their would be worse as they seem to be leaning pre-dominantly right now.

I truly, with every ounce of my being, believe the msm is controlling the media, the narrative and therefore they control a lot of people. The first red flag is the very fact that the msm aren’t neutral, they don’t pretend to be neutral and actually have very clearly picked a “side”. That’s an automatic disqualification for being bias and prejudice. I can’t believe people actually watch and believe that crap and are okay with the “side” picking media. I bet if the tables were turned it would be a whole other story. It’s very personal to the Dems and msm it would appear.
