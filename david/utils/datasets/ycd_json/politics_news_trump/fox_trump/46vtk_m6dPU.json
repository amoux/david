If an undocumented immigrant is arrested for a criminal offense, it tends to be for a misdemeanor. Researchers suggest that undocumented immigrants may be less likely to engage in serious criminal offending behavior because they seek to earn money and not to draw attention to themselves. Additionally, immigrants who have access to social services are less likely to engage in crime than those who live in communities where such access is not available.﻿", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "TRUMP LIES EVERYDAY"}

For its part, Iran paid settlements of more than $2.5  billion to U.S. citizens and businesses. The day after the nuclear deal was implemented, the U.S. and Iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order, with the U.S. agreeing to pay the $400 million principal along with about $1.3 billion in interest.

Nor is it like bill c's DOJ waiting till his presidency ended to try him for giving secret classified documents to china,and getting a fig slap on the wrist fine of $90K. Its not like barama who that stood in front of congress and said it did not matter if chargeing every person for socialist healthcare was against the constitution but he himself would make sure with his power,he would do it with or without them. And as such the attempt was illegal and the failure cost taxpayers,even those that could not afford any health insurance,trillions of dollars and grossly added to what some idiiots actually believe is a U.S. dept. It's not the corrupt 9-10 people high up,signing off on selling 20%of U.S. uranium to Russia,where hill-ton rcv'd over 145milliin$'s into all of her foundations,of which 90% is paid to the owners of the foundation. Its not like he's abandoning our troops in ben gazzi only to lose their lives by being raided by the call of who was suppose to protect them-thats right hill-ton. It's a friggin wall that cost less to build,than accomadate half of eveey south american country,thats thinks our welfare sysrem comes from a little fairy under a pillow.

What have you heard 'these people' say and what policies that they propose leads you to the inescapable conclusion that they want open borders?

But when you look at the statistics during the Bush and Obama administrations, Obama's deportation rate was miniscule compared to the amount of illegals that were coming over the border. Much of it had to do with the Catch and Release tactic. The fact of the matter is the dems in Congress have no clear answer for why they don't want border security (the wall) other than the claim that it will cost too much. But when presented with the facts that the cost is a drop in the bucket compared to the yearly government budget, it discourages crossings because it's a large physical obstacle, and the money saved from not having to hold and process illegals would easily pay for the wall and benefit the country as a whole, they have no argument. Pelosi is the most outspoken about the issue. You can listen to any one of her interviews regarding border security. She claims that it's \"inhumane, immoral, and that these people have just as much of a right to be here\". This, of course, is wrong. And when presented with facts and statistics, she has no further argument. There is NO argument for why we shouldn't have a border wall. The wall will be continued to be built. It will be finished. And America will prosper. \n\nJust as a side note: I have no problem with legal immigration. I just believe, as does the president,  that we should be able to choose the most beneficial people to come into this country. The problem is the entitled immigrants who feel that they don't need to follow the rules and can just come in whenever they please﻿", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Thomas Greiwe"}

Also that many of the shows and their stars such as this Judge Jeanine, Hannity and Laura Ingram etc don't actually provide the news, but instead provide an extremely biased and opinionated editorial of the news. I'm not telling you to stop watching Fox News, just to be aware that just relying on them to be up to date on the news wouldn't be the best of things. Also just getting the news from CNN or MSNBC etc wouldn't be the best idea either, although maybe marginally better.

I don't listen many of the hosts because although they start of with something I agree with, it takes a turn and they start going too deep. My views when I comes to border security are that I believe  a wall is needed to drastically slow down illegal immigration. I don't have a problem with legal immigration but I think that the US, as a country, has the right to know who comes in and we should be able to turn away anyone who won't benefit us. As for the president, I agree with him on most issues and he has drastically improved the country in the last 2 years. The economy is booming, North Korea isn't as much of an issue, ISIS is almost gone, lowest unemployment in 50 years, energy independent, etc..

Those are some reasons rights there. Here I'll even go over each point with you:\n\nThe wall would be impractical to build because it would need to be built in remote areas were a ton of infrastructure would have to be built: roads, work camps, concrete and steel facilities, etc. \n\nIt would be largely ineffective since 2/3 of illegals in 2017 crossed into the US at legal ports of entry and overstayed visas. A wall wouldn't have stopped them at all. As for drugs, about 95 - 98% cross into the US by the metric ton at legal ports of entry on ships, trains, planes, and trucks. That stat comes from a DEA report in 2017. \n\nLastly, thousand of pieces of private property will have to be either bought or seized. Those seized through eminent domain would be tied up in court for years if not a decade and be time consuming and costly.
