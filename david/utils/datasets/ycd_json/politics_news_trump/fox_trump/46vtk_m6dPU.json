{"cid": "UgxpobX2QjhU3_dwwQx4AaABAg", "text": "In the context of crime, victimization, and immigration in the United States, research shows that people are afraid of immigrants because they think immigrants are a threat to their safety and engage in many violent and property crimes. However, quantitative research has consistently shown that being foreign born is negatively associated with crime overall and is not significantly associated with committing either violent or property crime. If an undocumented immigrant is arrested for a criminal offense, it tends to be for a misdemeanor. Researchers suggest that undocumented immigrants may be less likely to engage in serious criminal offending behavior because they seek to earn money and not to draw attention to themselves. Additionally, immigrants who have access to social services are less likely to engage in crime than those who live in communities where such access is not available.Ôªø", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "TRUMP LIES EVERYDAY"}

That left people, \nbusinesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other, and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration. For its part, Iran paid settlements of more than $2.5  billion to U.S. citizens and businesses. The day after the nuclear deal was implemented, the U.S. and Iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order, with the U.S. agreeing to pay the $400 million principal along with about $1.3 billion in interest. The $400 million was paid in cash and flown to Tehran on a cargo plane, which gave rise to Trump‚Äôs dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night. The arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later, not crammed into containers.Ôªø", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Thyalwaysseek"}

But when you look at the statistics during the Bush and Obama administrations, Obama's deportation rate was miniscule compared to the amount of illegals that were coming over the border. Much of it had to do with the Catch and Release tactic. The fact of the matter is the dems in Congress have no clear answer for why they don't want border security (the wall) other than the claim that it will cost too much. But when presented with the facts that the cost is a drop in the bucket compared to the yearly government budget, it discourages crossings because it's a large physical obstacle, and the money saved from not having to hold and process illegals would easily pay for the wall and benefit the country as a whole, they have no argument. Pelosi is the most outspoken about the issue. You can listen to any one of her interviews regarding border security. She claims that it's \"inhumane, immoral, and that these people have just as much of a right to be here\". This, of course, is wrong. And when presented with facts and statistics, she has no further argument. There is NO argument for why we shouldn't have a border wall. The wall will be continued to be built. It will be finished. And America will prosper. \n\nJust as a side note: I have no problem with legal immigration.

VICE News did a great report in 2017 and spoke to about a dozen property owners along the border . Many, such as golf courses, will have large tracks of their courses cut off. Many ranchers will  have grazing land and water sources cut off from their properties by a wall. \n\nThere are estimates that the government needs about 500 pieces of private property to build the wall. Even if 9/10 are ok with being bought out, that leaves about 50 private property owners who will have their lands seized by the government. That's the definition of Big Government. That's the definition of government stepping all over private citizens rights. I firmly believe in the private property rights of people and don't want Big Government stealing land from the American people.  Furthermore, those 50 cases would be tied up in court for years or decades.Ôªø", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "C B"}
