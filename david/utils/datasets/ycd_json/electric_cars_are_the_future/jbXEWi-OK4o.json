There are different kinds of luxury that¬†one ¬†might desire or need,¬† but¬†it seem that the motor car industry today is using the latest gimmicks and gadgets¬†to sell their luxury cars. Most of what they offer is of very little use to me or many other¬†motorists, who simply want a very practical luxurious car, not a pile of gadgets that will¬†impress me¬†and will have very little use in the long run.¬†I am amazed how many people will buy a car that is very expensive,¬†because it is loaded with gadgets and gimmicks, that not¬†only complicate the car, but can make the car an extremely expensive item to repair and maintain, and then¬†worry about fuel economy. In the early 70's I owned a Jaguar XJ6 and people would ask me constantly about the fuel economy. My stock response was¬†¬†\"If I was worried about the fuel economy I would have bought a Mini.\"¬†Others told me that they did not like it because it was too quiet and far too smooth and comfortable. Now my point here is that I respected and understood where they were coming from, even though the modern cars of today have caught up to my old Jaguar. However the real point I am making here is¬†that there was a big choice back then, ¬†between the cheap bumpy car and one that offered me a real luxurious interior and a beautiful soft ride. Today one can spend a small fortune for a rougher riding with sports suspension,¬†with the latest gadgets and gimmicks¬†that I might never use.¬†This is why I now find the best value for money is the cheaper Asian cars which are more dependable than most so called luxury cars.

{"cid": "UgwMYORv74Owav9jW154AaABAg", "text": "I know a lot of people complain about Tesla‚Äôs interior but keep in mind Tesla is more of a technology vehicle rather than a luxury vehicle. So yes you might not get the best interior but you get a lot of other things that cars around the same price don‚Äôt have for example they come with air suspension so you can adjust the ride height, summon so you can move the vehicle back and forth from tight spots, Tesla phone app so you can set temperatures, track the vehicle in real time, home link which enables your garage to open and the Tesla to park itself or exit out of the garage with nobody inside, Autopilot so it drives it self in the highway or long roads, and they even include an 8 year unlimited mileage for the battery, and the best thing is that it doesn‚Äôt require maintenance like a bmw, Mercedes, etc. Theirs no such thing as oil changes, transmission fluids things of that sort which luxury manufactures will rip you off. They also get software updates like you phone so the car essentially improves over time as well as the maps and some functions unlike a normal car where you have to pay about $200 just to get updated maps. And a Tesla typically cost about $10 to fill up with electricity to give you anywhere from 260miles to 335 miles of distance rather than paying 40-50 at the pump for a full range. So overall yes a Tesla is not going to have a nice interior like a Mercedes or bmw but in my opinion the Tesla will have more bang to you buck and keep in mind a Mercedes Benz S550 starts at 96k while the Tesla starts at 78k and will our perform the S550 in speed, safety, and ride quality.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "anthony camargo"}

{"cid": "Ugj0bGtGJkWY-3gCoAEC", "text": "You gotta try and be less bias in your car reviews. \nFirst of all you need to be more skeptical of their claims, start up companies, especially tech companies, and car companies both like to make a ton of claims then deliver on very few of them, which means absolutely everything they tell you, you need to find out what's true, and what's hopes and dreams. For example the 1000bhp figure. \n\nThen, you gotta be less bias. For example, you said its a fair trade to have less leg room for more trunk space. No it isnt. Its an expensive luxury car, that means no compromises. Why the hell didn't they just make the body longer? Also the screen folds away, thats cool but it didn't seem to fold away completely which is super ugly, and again another compromise. When reviewing a car that'll probably cost a few hundred thousand dollars, you need to point out every little bad thing about it. Finally for a \"high tech futuristic\" car those screens sure had really massive ugly bezels. Makes me think they probably arent terrible modern either, Are they OLED 1444p? or are they the same shit that all other cars have. \n\nFinally you need to do more research. I mean you clearly arent a car review channel, your a tech channel, and maybe you dont want to just copy other peoples car review, you want to make it your own. But you admitted to yourself that you don't understand why the tesla false short in the luxury department, probably because you've never driven or taken a close look at other luxury cars. I mean if the tesla is 100k already then this must be 2-3 hundred thousand. Its not going against luxury sedans, its going against the v12 class of luxury cars. Bentleys, Rolls royce, S65, 760Li etc. Have you ever been close up with any of those cars? Do you know what to look for in a luxury car? Do you know what differentiated an 550i from a rolls royce ghost? \n\nThis was a great video, but it could have been much better and more informed if you a, did a bit of research before hand and b, added in a bit of negatives for all of the positives.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "martinshoosterman"}

What Maclaren, Porsche and Ferrari did was brilliant. They took the hybrid car concept and used it to create an awesome super fast hyper car, giving a shit about emissions and the environment, they took advantage of the electric motor design (initially built for the planet's sake) and used it so an internal combustion powered car could be even more powerful.

They are all cars that are used by families for day to day stuff including hold baby car seats etc. I for the life of me struggle to see a soccer mom or dad transporting their family from A to B or going on road trips. Perhaps this is suited to only the multi millionaire empty nesters and the rich baby boomers thats all.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Minds Eye"}

For people who's simply gonna switch a car every 2-4 years, it won't even offset the difference. Worse if their electric power is from coal plants. \n\nMoreover, while the idea is good on paper, and I have no doubt it will only get increasingly better and mainstream in the future, right now electric vehicle is not ready to replace the market. The luxury (such as what this is trying to do) is not there, this is a 200k car with chairs that don't look half as comfortable (no massaging either?) as a merc S class or Bentley. Nor as luxurious and tech heavy (yes, luxury tech in S class is a plenty) despite them trying so hard. You look at this and think it's well-made, but then go to a store and try sitting inside a S class or Bentley. The \"performance\" is also mostly for young people who enjoy penis measureing contest with 0-60 and all that, none of the electric cars actually drive well if you track or do spirited driving. Have you tried drifting a tesla? They are absolutely not a driver's car, sure one day we will all live on auto-driving cars, but that day is not today, some people still enjoy driving on challenging roads / tracks with a dynamic car. Last but not least is the cost, I'm sure outside of youtube shit talkers, not as many people care about \"super luxury\" or \"track day driving dynamic\". For the majority  it's simply about cost.

Mazda3 is slated to bring the first hcci to the market in 2018, according to them improving the thermal efficiency by 30% based on current efficient engine designs, which will in fact push the mpg much higher then the 60mpg delivered by the current best - Hyundai ioniq. I don't know why you are so focused on \"soot trails\" most of the market will in fact move away from ICEs but there is a good chance that a large portion of the luxury market will remain gasoline based, because of its history, preference, characterists, etc. That's also another reason why your environmental argument will be marginalised because in a dimished gasoline car market a consumer will be more inclined to believe \"I'm just one of the few of the many others\", rationalizing the purchase since the luxury market is not as big compared to numbers of sales in other car categories. Also do you your research before throwing out random numbers, it seems you are more so giving your sentiments rather than facts ", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Boris Bagryanskiy"}

So those engines are 30% at best.\n\nAnd they'll never do 0-60 in 2.2 seconds and get over a 100mpge. \n\n\nElectric cars use energy only when needed to move a simple rotor. \n\nPeople care about not having to deal with soot from their products, hence the popularity of evs. \n\nMuch like the car out phasing the horse carriage which had been around much longer and much more familiar to people than the car itself. \n\nPeople still have horses today but not on a grand scale. Same with Ice vehicles, and Koenigsegg agrees that electric vehicles are the masses preferred form of transportation and Ice will relocated to a niche group.\n\nIt appears you like to focus on sentiments when you keep wishing ice to have higher mpg, but hybrids with electric motors assisting, and pure electric destroys them in efficiency.\n\nAgain most people bought an EV because it's the better product that does not have soot and fumes.

Also dont get me wrong I think its great that electric cars will be phasing out ICE out of the majority of the market, I just do not think it is realistic to think that the luxury car market would be supplanted by electric vehicles as quickly as is suggested in this video implicating lucid air's potential with the top contenders being ICE based cars for a long time. I have already stated why, the environmental argument is probably the weakest here and so is the fuel economy of the vehicle(I was only relating the feasibility of an ICE by reminding you mpg is only improving). When someone is rich enough to afford 300k bentley mulsanne I think considering the fuel economy and more importantly propriety tax on the vehicle is not something of grave concern given the person's deep pockets to make the purchase in the first place", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Boris Bagryanskiy"}

If they are able to match range and performance of Tesla, Tesla is going to have hard time, since European cars such as Audi, BMW and MB are so much better otherwise.\n\nAbout that Tesla handling, I would say that they are ok, not terrible but certainly not amazing either, atleast when comparing Tesla Model X to Audi Q7. While Audi is almost as heavy as Tesla, it feels way more nimble and easier in curves. You feel the weight of the car more in Tesla. Its propably because Tesla is such a young company. They dont have the years of experience of building and fine tuning car chassis and suspension that european brands such as Audi and BMW have. \n\nAnd thats why I feel like Tesla is going to have hard time in future if brands like BMW and Audi can catch up in battery and electric engine technology. Why would you buy expensive Tesla with mediocre handling and mediocre interior when you can have something with similar performance, better handling, higher quality interior, and propably  with better reliability. \nIf you are looking for high end electric car and considering Tesla I would wait for year or two and see what europeans can come up with. Tesla is cool brand but imo they will be doomed if europeans can catch up with Tesla in technology. But if Tesla goes the way of dodo, it will always be remembered as a the brand who started the revolution of electric cars and that is already quite something.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Hyppyrotta"}

Germans even more. An American brand develops a car, tests it, says \"it's perfect, put a price tag on it\". A German company develops a car,  tests it, says \"it's not good enough\" and they go back to the drawing board. \nBesides just like you said Tesla is the new kid on block, they don't have decades of experience. So of course they still have to deal with some issues, that are still acceptable. We can't say tesla sucks and we can't say tesla is reliable. Still not enough time to really judge them. Model X silly doors issues are typical of a first gen product. They still learning. What tesla is, is the vision of a very decent human being that wants the best for us while other carmakers want the best for their own interests. I really don't want to see tesla going the way of dodo. And I think they won't. Because when carmakers like BMW and Audi and Mercedes decide that they want to make a car like tesla it will be even more expensive than tesla. Coz at this point they still don't want to come out with a car like that. Tesla didn't find gold where others couldn't. Like I said world is a very complicated place and there's a lot of interests and powers behind the car industry and behind governments. The world belongs to and is run by big corporations. Cars like tesla is not what those big hot shots want right now. Many carmakers already showed in the past that they can do it if they want. It's not a coincidence the first wave of electric cars from major car makers were/ are as ugly AF. They just don't want to sell them. Teslas autopilot? It's a joke compared to what Audi and BMW already showed in the past with cars going around a track at racing speed. Or going up Pikes peak. Or driving themselves to CES, Las Vegas, using turning signals and changing lanes taking over other cars and trucks by them selves. Or like I mentioned before that SLS electric. They can build those kind of cars. Sport electric cars, regular family electric  cars, small electric city cars. But so far they only come up with stuff people don't want to buy or can't afford to buy. They can if they want to. But so far they just been teasing us with products they don't wanna sell to fool us, saying that is the direction they want to go in the future. Tesla didn't find any rare blueprints no one else have, they already gave us and showed us that it's possible to build a good looking electric car with very decent autonomy.

But because you think it will work for yourself, you think it will work for the rest of the country. Well it will not. This idea of self driving only with no stop signs or stop lights will never happen. Now I understand city people's frustration with traffic, but it will go down without every car being self driving due to the rise of ride sharing that will happen in big cities. Fewer cars on the street. But your never going to have every single car self driving. The only thing that would solve over optional self driving is traffic and like I said, that will improve. There are many reasons that we will keep the option to drive like the need of a manual backup, hacking, utility of vehicles that's not just getting people from A to B in well developed areas, there will always be situations and places where a human will need to drive, and yes the big one for a lot of people, many still love to drive.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Nathan Curet"}

That's why these companies end up being sold. Even if Ferrari is a company by itself now, until very recently it  was owned by Fiat. And also that's not what I would call a luxury car maker.
