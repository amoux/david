If the entire world switches to electric cars, what do you think the governments response will be?  \"Don't worry we'll take the hit, we don't losing all that money.\"   Hahahaha yeah OK.  They'll find a way of getting it back.  Possibly some elaborate way of taxing electricity usage or mileage, but most likely a massive increase in toll roads or car tax.\n\n(You might argue that at the moment e car taxes are less, but that's only to encourage people to use them to get the emissions down, if the majority migrate to ecars, they will need to get their money back somehow, and they will find a way.)\n\nAnd B.  Electricity isn't in that great a demand at the moment.  If we all switch to ecars, the demand on the electricity grid and upgrades required will be phenomenal, and this will push the price of electricity up.\n\n\n2/  Safety - in some ways they are safer yes, but let's not forget in other ways they much more dangerous.\n\nA/  At the moment if you get an electric shock off your car you go \"ow\" and that's it.  Because it's a 12v humble supply.  If you get an electric shock off an e car it'd enough to kill you.  I know it hasn't happened so far, but there's not a lot of them about so far.  If they ever get ubiquitous to the same popularity as IC engines, the sheer volume of people mean the chances are much higher, especially once they start getting knocked around, poorly maintained, older, etc.\n\nB/  Explosions.  I know you all think petrol cars have petrol tanks which explode easily..... they don't.  That's just something film / tv show makers utilise because it makes for good action watching, but the reality is that it's very difficult to set a petrol tank on fire.  Much more so than a battery pack which can catch fire on its own without any external influence.  And of course if you're comparing it to diesel, well that's near impossilbe to catch fire by accident.  And the fact that people never say \"i'll buy a diesel because petrol might explode\" tells you how little an issue it is with petrol.  Electric cars on the other hand, well look at what happened to Hammond on Top Gear.  He was lucky to survive, yes the car was well built to protect him but this was in isolated incident, if you get these cars crashing regularly on the motorways/highways, the number of injuries and deaths from exploding batteries is going to skyrocket.  Much higher than petrol/diesel ever caused.

The wastes from batteries are toxic in nature, recycling is a major milestone to overcome.\nOne of my friends is working on the field of alternate energy sources and he clearly stated that increasing the potency of batteries is not a difficult problem but sourcing reliable raw materials and disposal is a crazy task.

{"cid": "UgzvHODvyHeLvyZrc0R4AaABAg", "text": "More EV apologetics propaganda.  \n\nToday I stopped by one of our 3 recharging stations on Sunday to time total recharging of an EV.  There were two cars waiting for one of the 4 recharging spaces to open up.  Wait time for the car I was watching first in line was 44 minutes.  It took him another 8 minutes of picking the right combination of dongle and credit card, interspersed with lots of cursing as there is no attendant to help him make it turn the damned thing on after he plugged in his car to the non-standardized charging cable.  After the charging started, I timed the minutes he kept his car connected to partially refill the battery pack.  He disappeared into the venue to wait.  1 hour and 13 minutes later, the car was charged but he didn't return until 15 minutes after it had shut off.  I didn't add that 15 minutes to the charge time.  So, we add 44 minutes wait time to 8 minutes cursing and fighting the chargeport computer plus 73 minutes charging time getting 124 minutes of his life wasted waiting for the miracle to happen.\n\nLet's see how much recharging cost in reality.  I can't tell you exactly because I didn't see the charge to his credit card for power.  But, let's be more realistic and say this guy makes $30/hour for his time at work.  (I could set that at $600/hr if he's a doctor or $1200/hr if he's a lawyer but let's say he works at a local factory as a senior supervisor who can afford a $45,000 car.)  $30 x 2 hours is $60 + charge time charges is a LOT more cost than refilling an ICE car in 3 minutes at Circle K.

My idea of the future car is one which is peddled somewhat like ah kids go kart and in the physical peddling Faraday laws of dynamos generators is employed but not in the familiar manner, as we have been told by the limitating laws of physics that more power cannot be extracted from less r even if not stated as such such is implied, if u have ever stopped on a push bike at the lights u might have noticed that when green says go your on the other side b4 the burners and u have only burned 1 r 2 calories, now if I have ay go kart with chain drive powered by physicah and change it to a peddle powered generator and motor even if we accept no addition in load most physicists will say no additional speed r gain  will be acquired but when a new type peddle powered generator is produced to move a car at office speed then they will say the laws of physics has not been broken only updated. So in my idea of such peddle powered generation of emf for electric motor, its like at gyro ball r just a ball within a ball and activated by pushing sliding peddles, one ball has the stators and the other the coils, when one stops peddling the balls will slow like a flywheel .because of the many coils and stators and gyro cum flywheel effect, huge power is generated by simply peddling. In such a car the steering column is central r between the legs, by pulling back on the column from the centre rest position power is sent to electric motor and by pushing forward from center rest position the brakes are enabled, on each of the  ground wheels is attached inductive generators so as car moves in motion from any type  of drive  power in percentage is rebated to battery cells. Also then relative to the hood r bonnet on top of such is at wind catcher a small flanged opening so that as the car moves at speed the wind flange catches wind and relays it to a wind operated generator under the hood r bonnet. Already some cars have solar and Infra panel on their roofs hoods and trucks boots and bonnets, and when parked at pop up wind speed indicator r somesuch device for small power pulse charging...... Also I think more respect should be given to hemplite car bodies r sound reasons why not. Although the science of UFO engines should continue, this kid is not in favour of levitating Karrs  and anti gravity belts for the masses would lead to such, the industrial age led to guitars sounding like enginized horns and lesser clarity for future generations due too many distractions in Mozart's  early days all he had for excitement was music influenced by galloping coaches and galloping horses and a jump here and there, a bit of billiards and shopping for rainbow buttons OK OK I make assumptions merry Xmas lawdy daw....such ah physical powered engine is very like the  gyro power ball  hand excirciser  only larger than a football and activated by foot sliding peddle platforms and Faraday laws, suggesting the outer face of the inner drum as having many power magnet faces and the inner face of the outer drum as having many coils converging to terminate at input to electric motors drive, I am not saying this kind of motor is the only kind coz that would be absurd, but I would expect large emf for small calorie burn and large emf is like invincible force to load , And relative to the hand excirciser one can easily speculate the sheer revs which could be obtained when the outer drum is mechanically concentric to foot sliding platforms!

It‚Äôs quite hard to fathom today, but at the turn of the 20th century, more than half the cars in the US were steam-powered. The steam engine was so advanced that, in 1906, a steam car called the Stanley Rocket even held land speed record ‚Äî a heady 127 mph!\nNow, you might think that the steam car was only a success because internal combustion engines (ICE) didn‚Äôt exist yet ‚Äî but in actual fact, steam cars and ICE cars were developed contemporaneously. Because engineers already had 100 years of steam engine experience, though, the steam car had a rather large head start. While hand-cranked ICEs were breaking the arms of hapless operators, by 1900 steam cars were already highly automated ‚Äî and, with no clutch or gearbox (steam provides constant pressure, unlike the piston strokes of an ICE), very easy to drive. The one caveat, of course, was that you had to wait a few minutes for the boiler to heat up.In a few short years, though, Henry Ford would come along and change everything. While the steam engine might‚Äôve been technically superior to the ICE, they couldn‚Äôt match the price of mass-produced Fords. Steam car makers tried to shift gears and market their cars as premium, luxury products, but by 1918 the Model T Ford was six times cheaper than a Stanley Steamer (the most popular steam car at the time).With the advent of the electric starter motor in 1912, and continuing advances to the efficiency of ICEs, it wasn‚Äôt long until the steam car vanished from our roads.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Another Settlement needs your help"}

{"cid": "UgzEeWs7ZthXnCjPuTF4AaABAg", "text": "Overall you got it right, in your final analysis--- EVs are better--- but you did get it wrong in several respects, and did miss a few points as well.\n\nYou did say EVs do not require a transmission, but you shoukd have also pointed out that they need no reverse gear to back up--- it only requires a change in power flow... providing a massive savings in weight, and far greater simplicity--- depending on what qualifies as a \"part\" (is a universal joint a \"part\", or a collection of a dozen or so individual ball or needle bearings, for instance), an EV can get by with as few as FIVE moving parts, such as you have in the Corbin Sparrow, perhaps not more than twenty moving  parts in the entire drive train.  This is compared to an ICE which can have several thousand moving parts including pistons, cranks, valves, springs, belts, lifters, rockers, gears, fuel pumps, torque converters, etc.\n\nAny moving part requires energy to keep it moving, and results in energy loss due to friction.  Reciprocating parts waste far more energy than parts rotating on their own center of gravity, and far, far more energy losses when considering square FEET of metal-against-metal friction (aided somewhat by lubricants).\n\nThe moving parts in an EV all rotate on their own center of gravity, and have infinitesimally less metal-to-metal contact, such as the ball or needle bearings at each end of the electric motor drive shaft, which altogether only amount to a single square inch or so.\n\nYour single greatest error, though, is in trying to compare the energy potential in a gallon of gasoline to a battery!\n\nYes, there is lots of energy potential in gasoline, but most of it is lost as chemical heat, friction heat, light, vibration, reciprocating motion, etc. After adding up all the parasitic energy losses, a battery-powered car is PRESENTLY just a little less efficient compared to an ICE car, and since billions are being spent yearly on battery chemistry at more than five dozen researh labs, universities, and even privately funded individuals, we most certainly have not exhausted all the possibilities regarding battery energy density.\n\nIf the comparisin of ICE and EV battery systems were as bad as you indicate, a Tesla Roadster would not be able to drive more than 620 miles on a single charge while driving at 60 mph... it has an efficiency rating of about 200 mpg equivalent... 0-60 mph of 1.9 seconds... and a top speed of 260 mph or so.\n\nA Chevy Bolt has a real-world range of more than 300 miles, an EPA rating of 119 MPGe, and is nearly as inexpensive as a comparable ICE car.\n\nThe first microwave ovens I saw in the mid-1970's cost about $4000.; they were rather pathetic, with no features such as turntables, touch screens or electronic timers--- they relied on a mechanical wind-up timer, like a cheap kitchen egg timer.  The last time I priced a microwave oven, they were about $40, had foir times the energy output, and had all the bells and whistles.  Computer CPUs, hard drives, digital screens, etc., have gone through similar price drops... as have digital watches, cell phones, etc.  The first digital watch I saw was a Seiko for $1009.  Several years ago I bought a pair of matching, men's and women's watches for ONE DOLLAR at a 99 cent store.\n\nEVs will not drop by that much, but their batteries are bound to plummet in price, making EVs far cheaper than ICE cars, with massively better performance, efficiency, and lack of need for service such as ICE cars require today.  ICE cars will NOT be able to compete at all very soon.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "billdale1"}

But there is a very important factor that changes the value of both systems, and that is engine efficiency. Most motors in electric car are around 90% efficiency, that means ~90% is converted to kinetic energy, the remaining 10% is waste energy in heat. On a combustion engine thats another story, todays high efficiency combustion engines work around 40% efficiency, older models or power over efficiency models can even be below 30%. So say we use your 250vs1200 values, in terms of efficient Wh/kg its around 225 vs 4800. Sounds a bit les crazy doesnt it?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "FullMetalFox"}

For example while it's true in general and for the Teals u used to illustrate it, that the battery pack is place so that it lowers the center of gravity of the car.  That fact is this varies and depending on the car's design (like in cars not orginally designed to be an EV).\nAnd it would have been useful to have included a Series Hybrid since it both has many of the advantages of an EV while increasing the efficiency of the ICE (for example HCCI become more viable option too) when it's used just as a generator.  So the future could and will likely have many powertrain options, not just a choice of a ICEV or a BEV.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "N C"}

You pointed at a resonator and not a catalytic converter, but that looks to be a graphical problem as there was no catalytic converter :-P\n\n2. Weight does not affect the car's handling if the suspension and wheels are engineered properly for the car. Take the BMW X5 M vs the M5 with similar track times and even study the Bugatti Veyron and its power to weight ratio vs track times of other hyper/super cars. The coefficient of friction should only affect the rolling resistance.\n\n3. A transmission is not used to \"transfer the motion to the drive wheels\", it is used to transfer gearing from the engine to the drive wheels\n\n4. not all waste heat is from the motor in a EV, you also get waste heat (energy) from chemical transfer of electricity to and from the batteries (which is covered later in the video) that should be taken into account as a whole\n\n5. You have to take into account that electricity has a bit of waste to not only reach its destination, but then also charge batteries, and you if store batteries to charge your vehicle than you will further waste more energy. On top of that, there is also self-discharge that has to be taken into account. Think of it as a storage tax and the closer they get to 100% charge the more it will self-discharge\n\n6. Not only is petrol much more energy dense (as stated in the video), but even more important.. it's much cheaper to store and doesn't have any further waste/degradation when moving around. Unless you can count the transportation of fuel as waste, and crude oil shipments, drilling, and refinement lol.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Gabriel Soria"}

Thus, if you travel only short distances every day, you practically never have to really \"wait\" for your car to recharge. You do this over night, when you're home and sleeping. And that changes the equation from having to find and drive to a gas station plus waiting there 5 minutes or more (if you're not the only one) compared to the couple seconds effort for (un-)plugging an EV every other week or so. With a range of about 400km (Tesla Model S), and a 5 day workweek that means every two weeks (400km per 10 days = 40 km/day should be good) you have a couple seconds effort.\n\n2. The fuel efficiency for an ICE is currently at a max of 14% and will not get any better in the near future (this technology is maxed out). An EV charged from local power network already has 34% efficiency (given the power is generated in an oil power plant) and if you can guarantee that the power comes from regenerative energy source, like water, wind and solar, it gets up to even 79%. If you own your own a solar roof and generate the charging power yourself, you even have 84% efficiency.

{"cid": "Ugy8fYVcEKvTT8IxA5B4AaABAg", "text": "IC cars are at this time much, MUCH better.    The cost of Li-ion batteries currently used in EVs is so high because of material processing and limited sourcing that you can only put a very limited mass of batteries in the car, and therefore the range is short.   If you use the advertised range often then the battery will degrade because it has a limited cycle life.   So today we have the Tesla model S which costs 90K and if you use the advertised range of 300 miles the battery can be recharged only 500 times and then it begins to fail and the range drops off dramatically.    For one third the price of that car you can get a great IC car which you can fuel up with gasoline or diesel anywhere and it takes only about three minutes.   If you can find a charging station for your Tesla it will take over 20 minutes, and fast charging again will damage the battery.   To preserve the battery you have to recharge it slowly over several hours.    There is just no comparision for cost and convenience.   Now if you used a different battery all bets are off.    There might be a cheaper battery in the future which is solid state, and that could change everything.   Also if someone were to use cheaper but heavier batteries like NiCad or similar ones then you could add more battery mass and have more range.   You could also work out a battery swapping system instead of high current thirty minute recharges.    There are several possible solutions but Tesla is not doing any of them because their buyers are rich and stupid enthusiasts who will pay 90K for a car they can't make trips in and they will nurse the battery by not using it's range and they still say they are happy because they are emotional morons and are not making rational decisions.   But the truth is few decisions about cars are rational, and most are based on emotion...  That's why I drive a 450 hp Mercedes.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Michael Froelich"}

Also the property on risk of thermal runaway differs greatly between the Li-Ion types so you cannot do a direct risk correlation between a cell phone battery to those used in an EV unless you can be sure that they are the exact same Li-Ion types. \nNow generally Li-Ion batteries do not explode since their casing is designed to vent over pressure so I would say that explosions are unlikely. The higher risk is the possibility of a thermal run-way which generates large amounts of heat but that requires certain conditions and is not something that just happens out of the blue without some prior warning signs.  The battery management system in EV batteries keeps tight control to prevent and detect thermal run away conditions so also there the risk is relatively low. Furthermore the batteries are enclosed in structurally strong metal container which minimizes physical damage to the battery packs inside and it also helps contain the heat for some time in rare case that a thermal run-away occurs.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Milan Swoboda"}

The top 3 production methods are done via steam reformation which creates large quantities of CO2 as a byproduct but they are cheaper than the electrolysis of water but still more expensive than Gasoline.  I think pricing of the high purity and highly compressed Hydrogen which is required for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles runs at something like 10 to 16 USD at the pump ( if you find one ).  So for example  with a Toyota Mirai, which has a 5kg Hydrogen capacity, you'd pay  between 50 to 80 USD for a complete fill and that gets you about 312 miles (EPA rating). \nFurthermore  fuel cell vehicles are electric vehicles with a smaller battery pack that have a fuel cell added on so they are hybrid vehicles.  This adds complexity, maintenance  and cost. Fuel cells also do not last forever and output degrades over time. Normal life expectancy of a Hydrogen FC is something like 2000 hours  (~60K miles) but they install over capacity fuel cells in the vehicles to achieve around 5000 hours (~150K miles) before requiring replacement.  \nOh and just in case you'd like to generate Hydrogen at home via electrolysis with Solar panels so that you can refuel your FCV  at home like you could with an all electric BEV: estimate about 75-110 Kw of electricity required for 1kg worth of high purity Hydrogen so you'd have to invest in a rather large solar system + electrolysis apparatus + purifying system + high pressure compression and storage system + maintenance needed of that system.

While mining and processing rare metals toxic and even radioactive contamination may occure. Some studies figured out, that in comparison you can drive a normal petrol car several years to balance out the amount of energy that is used to build and run an electric one. The battery loses capacity over time so it needs to be changed. And how are these components recycled? I've never heard of an shrinking fuel tank. If everyone would drive an electric car, how do we cope with the excessive demand of energy? Most of our energy is still produced in nuclear and coal power plants which has to be considered as well. You don't just plug a cable into a wall and the power comes magically out of nowhere. And the infrastructure for a wide range net of charging stations doesn't even exist rudimentary. You have to transport the electricity via cable to every station and deal with the energy loss at a great distance. So a transformer is needed on every station, producing a huge amount of heat. And if a bigger number of people try to charge up their cars simultaneously, I don't think the electric infrastracture can handle the sudden increase in demand.\nIf you run out of petrol you can take a jerry can, walk to a gas station and refuel you car.

I commute a stupidly long distance: 82 mile one way. 164 one-day total. I know. I'm an idiot. I had a PT Cruiser. 23 miles a gallon. That got expensive. So I got a Honda CR-Z. 36 mpg. Better. Still, I was paying something like $3,040 over the course of my 180 runs a year. I became obsessed with my fuel bill. I learned how to \"Hypermile\", which means I learned how to drive REALLLLLLY SLOOOOOOLY, and I could get it up to 40 mpg for months at a time. But that got old. Then, I saw the TESLA Model S.  Amazing. Great range, and good enough for me. Too expensive. Then I saw the Chevy Bolt EV.  Great range: 250. But I didn't know how expensive electricity is. Turns out, it's about 1/3 the cost of gasoline, compared to my Honda. But then I got solar panels put up. Now my electricity bill is effectively Zero.  Anyway, back when I was spending $3,000 a year on gasoline, I was getting 36 mpg.  If I had to make my run in your 1978 F-150, i'd have to burn up 18 gallons of gasoline, which would burn up the whole gas tank, and that would cost me - $65.70 just for one day. 180 runs times $65.70 is an astonishing $11,870.  WOW!  ELEVEN THOUSAND, EIGHT HUNDRED and SEVENTY!  FUCK THAT! But if I had your F-150 for 10 years, I would have to spend $111,870 on gasoline. ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THOUSAND, EIGHT-HUNDRED AND SEVENTY!    For me? Zero. In fact, because of my solar panels -- which will be paid off in 7 years -- I'll actually SAVE on my electricity bill, which will basically be like getting a RAISE. $111,870.

Oil exploration and drilling is even less eco friendly and an oil spill in the ocean will be far more disastrous than lithium carbonate being spilled on the ground.\n- Hydrogen is not available in its elemental form on planet earth instead it is bound in molecules to other elements therefore Hydrogen cannot be harvested and must be produced.  The problem is that the hydrogen bond is very strong in molecules and a large amount of energy is needed to break this bond thus making hydrogen expensive to produce therefore not competitive especially if used in an IC engine which adds a low operating efficiency to the mix.

One reason was pollution. Old consisted cities like Boston and New York, you would be ankle deep in horse crap.

Decision point is if it work or not. Currently EV cars are overpriced with poor mileage, questionable impact on environment and long charging time. I agree that this may work for some people but it will definitely not work for most of them.\n\nYou should also look at this from distance as on big picture. There are still lot of questions not answered about how things should work if everyone switch to EV car. For example what will be impact on \"daily\" and \"trip\" recharging (and others).\n\nRight now it doesn't matter to much if you supercharge your car. There are not so much car in use so it will not make significant spike in power usage. With more and more EV cars and more users \"daily\" charging we sooner or later end-up with situation that charging car will require central management. Really the same situation as with big factories. This will lead to prolonged charging time which is already inconvenient for most of the people.\n\nSimilar situation will be with trip usage. Not all people have enough money to afford plane trip (or are willing, is available, etc.). It is not unusual to see queue on gas station during summer time. You will usually wait only couple of minutes if you end-up at gas station with queue. If this happen on EV charging spot then you may wait there for hours to get through queue ...\n\nAnother problem is that electricity is centrally operated. If gas station lose power then they start generator and continue to provide service. With electricity we still don't have efficient local storage so any blackout will cause major disruption. Search for example for \"TV pickup\" problem in United Kingdom. It will be exactly same with EV cars in future ...\n\nBatteries are still not efficient enough. Therefore I think that EV cars are still dead end. Power train, inverters, UI and so on is great but we need another power source.  Something which is not loosing lot of power just by charging / discharging and can be \"recharged\" quickly. Something which can be stored locally and then quickly transferred to car. Really something similar to gas / diesel. I think that future is more like in fuelcells. You can generate \"fuel\" all day long and quickly transfer (pour) to car if required. This will allow quick \"recharge\". It will not cause too much stress on grid and you can generate \"fuel\" when there is excessive amount of energy (for example from solar panels during day). You can extend range by adding some containers in trunk and so on ...\n\n... and my personal view at end. Some time ago I calculated what will be impact for me from switching from ICE to EV. I personally like \"always connect\" features of Tesla. Especially ability to preheat or cool car remotely but ... I drive a lot. I drive ~40 000km / yeay. Almost all my drives are ~ 500km and are on highway. With my current ICE car it is about 4 hour trip. Exactly same trip with Tesla is at least 5.5 hours and almost no range reserve at destination. This is still not counting waiting on charge spot and so on and it is huge impact. \n\nFYI: I know that my usage pattern far away from most of the people but it is one of the reason why we should not push this. Everyone should have opportunity to decide if EV car will work for him or not. I think there are still plenty of early adopters which are willing to sacrifice some of ICE benefits in order to have EV car ...", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lukas Dzunko"}
{"cid": "Ugj-aVDmmWv8QHgCoAEC.8VhaxUa2NYn8VtLWOAHxHE", "text": "PC's were expensive when they first hit the market. Now they are cheap. The first cars were expensive, then came the Model T. This was true for many of the modern conveniences you use today. Right down to your laptop PC, Smart Phone, and Tablet.\n \nThe current price of todays EV is mainly based on the cost of the battery cells. The initial cost was high. Demand grew faster than production. At the same time cost to produce LI-ON battery cells dropped as production efficiency increased. In order to address the demand companies are building massive manufacturing facilities. The chemistry of the LI-ON cell is also improving which increases energy density. The new 21700 cell (now being used in Tesla Model 3 and the new Power Wall/Pack) energy density is approximately a 35% increase. The cost to produce these cells is also dropping with scale. The new chemistry is fully recyclable. Your environmental argument is true with nickel-hydride and even that lead acid battery in your car today. This is not true for LI-ON.\n\nLet me \"big picture\" this from what is happening. Even if everyone with a car wanted to drive an EV tomorrow in one large city the inventory world wide would be exhausted in less than a second. The demand today for EV's that people truly want already have to order them and wait. For some models only months, for others, they are looking at a year. Check out the road maps for the major manufactures and you can see that is not going to change in the near term. Demand is growing and manufactures targeting this demand will benefit. Others will pay a price.\n\nWith this increase in demand you are already seeing more and more charging stations. Many existing charging stations are already being upgraded as the technology improves with each passing year. This is a now thing, it is happening now. Does everyone go get gas at the same time today? No, they don't. Ever notice more than one fueling station at an intersection, or one just a block from another? Sometimes even the same brand? Solutions to this fear are already being addressed and will only improve. \n\nThe majority of gas stations in the USA do not have backup generators. And we get all kinds of weather related disruptions. Hurricanes, floods, blizzards, ice storms, earth quakes, you name it. If you did not fill your tank before the event hit, if you are lucky enough to find a station with a generator you had better get their quick for his supply is limited and he will be out of fuel in no time. I have lived in both the north east and in the south east. I have lived through blizzards and hurricanes and been without power for days. No power, no fuel. As people flee the coast when majors summer storms hit they fill up and supply runs low. Having a generator does little good. \n\nYour fear of the grids impending catastrophic meltdown are greatly exaggerated. Utility operators know this is happening today. Have you not noticed utility scale solar farms in your travels? Wind turbines? You do realize the utilities are adding storage technologies to capture peak production from solar and wind for use later in the day or night. Did you know that some utilities in Europe enter into agreement with heavy industry with them so they will run an extra shift. They get the power for essentially nothing due to the excess power being generated from their base load plants? Have you notice the increase in rooftop solar? Did you know that Ikea now sells solar panels and battery storage as a packaged system? Ikea. That is a clear single that rooftop solar is now hitting mass market appeal. There is no going back.\n\n I like fuel cells and 10 years ago I thought they would develop quicker than battery technology. GM, Toyota, Mercedes, to name a few were throwing a ton of cash at their development with little to no investment in battery technology. The Toyota Pries with it's nickel-hydride battery did not even seem to excite Toyota. Then a few geeks in California built a little sports car based on the Lotus Eclipse using battery cells out of laptop PC's. That battery technology R&D's main drivers were your power hungry smart phones, tablets, and laptops. Kind of under the radar for automotive. One by one they have shifted their investments in fuel cells to EV's. Toyota is now shifting that investment to solid state batteries. That's still a lab project its promise is extended range and super fast charging. Could be five years out, could be ten. Economics will drive it's adoption. You will have to pay a premium for this convenience upon introduction. The challenge, LI-ON might be so cheap with more than enough energy density and fast enough charging to satisfy 80% of the market. That can really put a crimp in adoption due to cost differential. \n\nIf you worry of the cost of EV's, then the cost of fuel cell power for cars should worry you much more. The the race to extend the range of EV's while dropping the cost of the battery packs and driving down charging times is already well underway. Fuel cells can not compete based on cost. Even large city busses are moving toward batteries not fuel cells for the same reason. They are some in London now. \n\nAt 40,000KM a year you run about twice the US average which is about 12,000 miles. Our fuel has always been cheaper in the US due to generous subsidies to the oil and gas industry. I to was a high milage driver running over twice the US average (50,000KM) and never liked giving my money to the gas company. For every driver that runs twice the average there are two that have to run at half, or four at a quarter, or eight at.... Well you get the picture. That means for every driver like you there are at least twice as many that can easily switch to an EV without worry.\n\nThe cost of EV's will continue to drop. The selection will continue improve. Over time the EV not an ICE will be powering the automotive future. The economics of the EV is now in the driver seat. This change will accelerate. With renewable energy electricity will get cheaper, the fuel is free. Ikea is not selling you the future.

{"cid": "Ugj-aVDmmWv8QHgCoAEC.8VhaxUa2NYn8VwdHm6UhwX", "text": "Personally, I'd start my research with projected resale value. I would avoid hybrids. The Honda Pries might be a great car and many love them. I would not buy one for two reasons. I believe they still use nickel-hydride batteries, and their is the added complexity of dual power plants. I Think Honda is the only one still using Nickel-hydride unless you are looking at golf carts. I believe the rest of the hybrids use LI-ON. Still, not on my list due to dual power plants. More to go wrong, more maintenance. At this point I would go with pure EV. That is just me. Many, many, people own hybrids and love them. If it works for you, it works for you. That's cool.\n\nNow, here is where it is difficult for anyone not familiar with your specifics to make recommendations. I do not have any inside information in regards to manufactures specific plans for their battery pack capacities. It is safe to say that the race for range is now afoot in each segment. This trend will continue. The EV market is really just now starting to gain momentum. Some of the manufactures are in it now only for compliance purposes. That means low inventories and limited selection. Other have fully embraced the EV, they have sold well. That means low inventories and limited selection. Same problem for very different reasons. I'd want the full embrace. A compliance car is more likely to be a compromise of corporate priorities. \n\nFor most price and range are key drivers for EV buyers. Not surprisingly the most affordable EV's have limited range. They work well for urban dwellers, people with short commutes, second car... This year some of these cars are due for a boost to get the low end to exceed 100 miles. Some are available with upgrades to larger battery packs.\n\nThe claim, for what it's worth, is the mass market acceptance for an EV means 200 mile range. Today there is the Chevy Bolt and the Tesla Model 3. I think the next Nissan Leaf will be close if not in there as well, could be a few more. The reality of taking delivery of a Model 3 within the next year is zero. Sold out long before release. The upside would be owning the latest technology with all the bugs worked out long before.\n\nThe rest of the EV market is the upscale luxury segment. Expensive but awesome. We can all dream.\n\nSo, this is really down to personal preference. I have never met an owner of a hybrid that was ambivalent or negative regarding their purchase. The same is true for EV owners. Of course they had the early adopter mentality. That phase has passed so it's up to you, your needs, and where you are with what you drive today (loan/lease dictates for most of us). I am well past the brand loyalty phase. If you like the car, it gets good reviews, and good resale value, then go for it. If range and selection are not meeting your criteria, then keep your powder dry until it does. It will. The prices will drop, and the selection will grow.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "tropicalday88"}

What were they betting on? Biofuels? No, they were betting heavy on fuel cells. Which is still basically an EV it's just using Hydrogen instead of a battery. GM had one, and so did Mercedes. Guess which type of car they are all now producing as the alternative? An EV.

Just a few weeks ago Tesla unveiled it's semi and they already have hundreds on order. And Tesla is not the only company building one. Maintenance is a big reason why. The same is true for cars in many respects. The electric motor has far fewer parts and is far less costly to produce. And no need for a transmission, which is also rather expensive. The battery cost continue to drop in price as it's energy density increases and that's just Li-Ion.

I cannot afford to wait hours for the thing to charge, i need to have a car available at any given time. EV's will be useful when batteries will be able to charge in 5-10 minutes and have 500 miles of range from that charge. Until then, they are only useful for city driving. And I myself prefer to walk thru the city instead of driving because it's faster than being stuck in heavy city trafic + it's good excercise. \n\nAnd believe me, when EV's get cheaper, they will get cheaper for a reason - companies will use cheaper parts, making them less durable, therefore they will break just as often as gas cars nowdays, if not more. And electricity will probaly get a lot more expensive too. Goverments are not going to give up profit that comes from gas taxes, neither will companies give up the money that comes from selling spare parts. They're cheap to run now only because they're rare and to attract people to buy them. It's a marketing trick. When ICE cars get banned, we will be stuck with EV's like we were with ICE's for almost a century now, they'll make it expensive. \n\nIt's great if it works for you, but it just doesn't work for many of us YET, so don't insult us thinking you're smart because you've driven so many ICE's.

Total pollution sum. I know that electric cars don't exhaust CO and other pollutants, but how does it stack up to Lithium Ion batteries - because those are pollutants too. They not only have toxic components in them, but there's a cycle of production and replacement to consider. Of course the entire infrastructure involved in extration, transportation and whatnot for gas also have separate impacts to make for a total comparison, but it'd be interesting to see a study on that (there probably already is, but I mean on the video comparison);\n\n2. Lithium Ion safety concerns. This is a problem in both cases of course... petrol chambers and other energy sources like biogas can be pretty explosive and flammable too. But Lithion Ion is not only flammable, we also have some very graphic examples of thermal runaway. When you are driving around in a car in which entire bottom is basically made of a chain of batteries with potential for thermal runaway, the results of a crash or even a single battery failure can become extremely dramatic. I understand several extra steps were taken to make things more secure for cars like the Tesla models, but we'll have to see how things go in real life scenarios overtime;\n\nOther than that, agreed that the overall engineering of it is simplified by several degrees. The jury is still out for me though. I totally understand that battery technology is expected to improve in several ways over the years, but I have no intention of spending a whole ton of money right now if a safer and less polluting battery tech is right around the corner.

Although in many countries up to half of road mileage could be transferred to electric WITHOUT increasing generation, merely by charging cars during periods of lower grid demand. Until grid demand across 24 hours is a fairly balanced and you are increasing the peak energy demanded on the grid you don't need to build more power generation (although works to the low voltage grid would be required as residential grids would need to be reinforced with that number of cars charging). You also have the effect of using wasted energy and production capacity for plants that are currently kept idling (like combined cycle gas plants) because they can't easily be throttled up and down and take days or week to restart if shutdown.\n\n\"the amount of fossil fuels used to create that electric energy would be nearly the same.\"\nNow that's total nonsense.

Both wind and solars utility scale inputs to the grid are growing rapidly. New battery technology  being installed today is the reason why some utilities have publicly stated they will never build another gas powered peeker plant. The older filthy coal plants that you are referring to are also being phased out. Home solar is also growing rapidly. \n\nThe numbers used for electric generations will continue to improve. Battery technology will continue to improve. The closer you are to your source of electricity the lower the loss.

All electric cars are automatic and if you have any brain cells you will know that automatic transmissions shouldn‚Äôt be considered driving because if you don‚Äôt know how to drive a manual transmission you don‚Äôt know how to drive because it‚Äôs as simple as flipping that bitch into drive and pressing your foot down on the accelerator, where as in a manual you actually have to know how to drive, know your car, know how to change gears and actually take consideration of the people around you, the only people that should be driving an automatic should be people who have a medical issue,disability or are above a certain age and physically can‚Äôt drive a manual because of it. Electric and automatics aren‚Äôt the future, we will always need IC engines and nothing can change that, if they truely cared about the planet they would have made this shit along time ago and not now when the planet is in real danger, it‚Äôs humanity‚Äôs fault that the plant is where it is now with pollution and some countries with little to no food/water and over population in most countries.

That particular grid is operated by Transgrid and after a somewhat botched privatization in the 90s has had little investment, it's quite old and fragile with poor interconnection.\nThe total bollocks their energy ministry has been putting out absent any supporting evidence had more to do with a plan by one of their local political parties to build a new generation of coal plants, even when contradicting reports from AEMO on the actual events didn't support their conclusions they still pushed the lie that renewable generation had something to do with the blackout.\nYou will note that economic realities have prevented the australians from getting funding for those new coal plants... nobody in the private sector was willing to put money into them, and even with substantial barriers to entry such as grid connection issues (like I said, crap grid, little investment) private, subsidy free solar and wind (and some battery storage) is filling nearly all of their new supply coming on line.... even as older coal plants are retired.\nI would also point out that despite a massive potential for developing renewables, the barriers put in place by the australians to subsidize their coal industry have meant that australians pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world.\nOh... and if you don't believe me on transmission losses... here's your own EIA: https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3\nAnd here's EIA average data by US state: http://insideenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/State_Losses.png", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "cros13"}

Worse if we could get serious vertical farming working economically to cover that the global population can be expected to explode once again (Every major breakthrough in agriculture before which has boosted the food supply has done this).\n\nThe truth is that we have a number of tricky problems ahead of us and while everyone constantly focuses on climate change and I certainly do see it's a major problem and one we need to deal with I'm not blind to the fact that we have a number of other issues, fresh water availability is being stretched globally, pushing our agricultural land as hard is also a big concern not only is it being depleted to the point of being useless in some regions of the world but at current rates we are going to struggle to mine enough phosphorus for fertiliser in around 2050 now granted that is likely to go the way of peak oil with ever increasing prices for food as fertiliser gets more expensive as opposed to some of the more paranoid projections but it's certainly something to give some consideration to.\n\nHonestly I really do get the feeling that we really are getting to the point where it's time to start really accepting the reality we can't just keep trying to boost both the global population and living standards the way we are and expect to do it all on this one single planet alone.

Not only are baterries heavy as hell but so, too, are the motors, and as we all learned in grade school (didn't we?) the greater the mass & weight, the greater must be the applied torque to overcome inertia.

No an electric motor is more reliable than a gas engine as it has less moving parts and requires absolutely no maintenance. The brakes barely have to be changed because regenerative breaking slows the car down so much the only time you ever use the brakes is to make a complete stop. When it comes to sensors and tires most cars today have sensors and all have tires so makeing them just an electric car problem is absurd. According to AAA the average sedan owner spends $10,000 annually on maintaining their car over a 10 year period that would be $100,000, while in a tesla replacement of the battery after 10 years will cost less than $20,000 depending on the size of battery you are replacing it with.\n\nEdit:I realize that $10,000 a year sounds ridiculous but that factors in gas too with an average of 15,000 miles a year.

I'm guessing because you are a thermodynamics chemist, you are more concerned with the the change of enthalpy of reaction (hess's law) and rates of reaction (kinematics). Maybe you design catalysts, to reduce activation energy of reaction. These ideas are a small subset of thermodynamics in general.\n\nMaybe this is why you think lithium is 100 percent recoverable. It's not.\n\nTell me, in any of your chemistry labs, when you did an extraction, did you ever achieve a 100 percent yield? \n\nNo you didn't.\n\nSome methods are good at physically separating chemicals, such as distillation. But even distillation can come into problems. Such as the chemicals behaving as azeotropes. Even if you're separating two very different species, that easily come apart, you still won't have 100 percent recovery, because no industrial process is truly closed. Actually, there are textbooks written on this stuff, to make better designs with higher yields.\n\nTo say you can get 100 percent of anything recycled to the point where you don't need to mine for new material, well you might as well claim that free energy and perpetual motion are possible (they're not).\n\nThe real world is never 100 percent efficient, not from the stand point of thermodynamics, not from the stand point of material balance.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jon L"}

By the way, my thermodynamics experience is useful in building this invention that uses chemical reaction through heat transfer to create motion in which creates electric power.

As an example, this data is from LG's 18650 high discharge cells used in Teslas.  Additional information on charging from Battery University on the net is of particular interest.  Batteries, especially Li Ion, are not magic or supernatural in any way.\n\nLG 18650 cells can be discharged up to 20 amps.  Impressive, but let's look at the finer print.  LG states that if you discharge the cells at 10 amps, their life is approximately 300 charge-discharge cycles.  If you hot rod the X with a heavy foot, the 20 amp discharge rate kills the cells faster at 200 charge-discharge cycles.  To make the cells last 8 to 20 years you'd need to park the car in a heated-cooled garage and hardly ever actually USE IT!  This is not my idea.  Go to batteryjunction.com and pick the LG 18650 bare (unprotected) cells which are $US7 each.  There's a click spot for LG's specification sheet on the webpage.  No mention of any religious or supernatural cell activity, though.  Heavy discharging Li-Ion cells results in the anode being PLATED by the Lithium metal!  Too much plating results in cells SHORTING and the accompanying FIRE AND OVERHEATING.  Keep drag racing that X.  Musk will always sell you a new car.\nThe most interesting thing Battery University shows about Li-Ion cells is their charging temperature range.  It states that Lithium Ion batteries must NEVER be charged below 32F (0C)!  Huh??  Does the supercharger heat up the -30F battery pack BEFORE charging starts?  How long does it take to bring 8000 cells up from -30F to +32F when it's -30F outside?  University warns you must never charge freezing Li-ion cells.

A huge part of that is the average efficiency of modern car engines of at most 15% (yes, best case is 30 to 40%, however in only one very tiny spot on the power curve close to full power) versus 90+% for an electric motor, and if one compares that to stationary power supply by electric generation in power plants which easily reach 45% efficency, more if they use the heat for household and industrial heating it becomes clear while even the fossil fuel vs fossil fuel comparison comes out in favor of the BEV.\n\nHowever, the energy mix turns towards more and more renewable energy in many countries and it is already cheaper to install solar generation capacity than building new coal plants on a per kWh basis.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Soordhin"}

If I can make it work, living 80 miles away from where I work, then anyone can. There's no excuse not to. If I need to go on a 'journey\" of over 119 miles, I'll take a plane. Honestly, when was the last time you had to go someplace that was further than 119 miles. Never, that's when. Dude, a range of 119 miles is driving at an average of 60mph for two hours, turning around and heading back for two hours. People don't do that.

It mostly comes from the country of Chile, but there are large quantities of it in Nevada, which is why TESLA is located there. Also, Lithium is indestructible, it being a basic element, so it can be recycled indefinitely. Look, I get it, you're scared. Don't be. You should be proud of the American car manufacturers like GM and TESLA, right here in California. China hasn't come up with anything like a CHEVY BOLT 238 miles, or TESLA with its' truly AWESOME acceleration, the fastest mass-produced sedan in history. Europe is still piddling around with ranges that just eek over 110 miles. Chevy just kicked ass with the BOLT: 238 EPA, (and most people get better than that without even trying. I'm one of 'em) EMBRACE THE PRESENT. It's EXCITING. Let go of the oil-stained, polluted past. You're living in an amazing time. \n\nPollution is a problem for the whole world. We humans have been using the thin (2 miles or so) of breathable air we have on earth as a trash can for over 100 years. We've polluted it pretty bad. CO2 stays in the air for about 100 years. I bought an EV because its' the responsible thing to do. I'm a teacher, and when the kids learn that I drive 80 miles to work every day, and they can see my Chevy BOLT EV sitting in the parking lot, right out the window, they know that driving an EV a long distance in an EV is doable, a reality, actually.

While some of the materials that go into make the batteries are pollutant, they are in no way more polluting than use of fossil fuel. The entire process of extracting and refining petroleum is as polluting if not more. Plus when you burn that fuel in an highly inefficient engine you get even more pollution, which is released in the air of the cities that we live in, right in front of our noses in the air we breathe. Plus fossil fuel and ICE are at the end of the technological life cycle, they can't be improved much. But Electric cars and batteries are at the beginning.
