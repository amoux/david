{"cid": "UgwoBVTUA5RwpsMxwnV4AaABAg", "text": "Two issues\n\n1: Reduced gas prices due to lower oil prices will make gas powered cars cheaper, which will taper off demand for EVs\n2: You also assume that with cheaper oil, that demand would fall, while in reality other industries [Chemical, Big Phrama, Electrical, Plastics, Cosmetic] would pick up the slack when they are presented with very very cheap feedstock and energy.\n\nThis is also assuming you can get past the issue that there isnt an unlimited supply of lithium in the world, and that with increased demand on the limited supply will cause prices to jump [unlike oil, which can be created basicly everywhere and is very flexiable on where it can be found, lithium can only be found in a few select locations in the world with the right climates and right soil, and Sodium batteries are not amazing either, you cant get around lithium with that].\n\nAll in all, while EVs very well could tap down oil growth, its unlikely to fall more so than flat line, just due to the fact that there are a lot of other industries that would jump at the ability to get cheap oil, making a price floor. Plus its nearly impossible [or i should say impratical] to go 100% renewable with out things like nuclear energy or fusion [which the former is hated on unfairly due to irrational fears of nuclear bombs and two accidents [that in the grand scale of things, where not that bad] and the later is 30 years away yesterday, 30 years away today, 30 years away tomrrow and 30 years away in 30 years time], so your going to likely still have a huge demand for base load oil or natural gas, which would only grow with cheap energy.\n\nAgain EVs can likely tap down the growth in oil, but not eliminate it [look at coal for example, after decades of protests aginst it and governments trying to reduce its use world wide, we are now only barely reaching peak coal in 2018/2019, and coal has a lot less uses than oil does.] More than likely this \"Neo-Peak Oil\" will only come around when oil either truely starts running out [or the cost to extract it rises way to high] or some breakthrough that no one can see happens [unlikely]. \n\nBut this is only coming from a Chemical Engineering degree student at Michigan Tech who is also getting a minor degree in \"Petro-Chemicals and Polymers\" and \"geology\", so what do I know [A lot on this in fact].", "time": "18 hours ago", "author": "The Reeper"}

(In 2017, the percentage of US electricity generated using fossil fuels was 63%.)  So, if electric vehicles are evenly distributed around the US, they will essentially be fossil fuel powered vehicles.  But this will be a very inefficient use of fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels will be burned at the utility plants, where it will be converted into electricity.  Then it will be transmitted to communities during which energy losses will occur.  Then it will be distributed to homes during which energy losses will occur.  Then it will be used to charge your EV's battery, during which more energy losses will occur.  So, if you are going to power your vehicle using fossil fuels anyway, it's much more efficient just to use a fossil fuel consuming engine.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Tom Nally"}

Marine ships also are yet reliant on low quality very contaminant gasoline and in huge quantities and those things are the living veins of today's international economies, for instance most countries in the world don't produce enough food to feed themselses and rely on imports, sometimes from places very far away.

These guys are talking about putting hundreds of mega watts of electrical energy into electric vehicles on mass, as if its the same as charging our mobile phones. Trying to charge an electric vehicle from a lamp post is like trying to fill an olympic size swimming pool from a dripping tap. We barley have enough spare electricity in the UK to keep the lights on. We will need hundreds of new nuclear power stations and a complete rebuild out of the national grid to meet the electrical demand that these vehicles will place on our electricity supply network. Sadly these car manufactures know a lot about building cars and nothing about the impossibility of the electricity industry to supply the electrical energy needed to power them - I am not anti-electric car. I understand and can see clearly that these vehicles are masterpieces of technology and are perfect for many driving scenarios - but please just tell me where is the electricity coming from to power millions of these things on our roads ???", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Ian Hickman"}

Electric drivetrain production costs are also already on par with their combustion equivalents, if you don't take the batteries into account. However, that was also the case with early 20th century electric cars, and they were taken out by bad battery technology and actions of a smaller oil industry. Today, we have only 0,1 % of electric cars, versus almost 40% 110 years ago. Have in mind the oil industry is now much more powerful, and is buying out all energy storage technologies and suppressing them, lowering the chances of a disruptive battery technology reaching the market.\n\nMy guess for the future is that electric cars will remain costing about 60% more than their conventional counterparts, and battery energy density will remain on it's current trend, taking about 10 years to double. However, in the near future, someone with ties with the oil industry will release some sort of fuel dependent electric generator (direct fuel/hydrogen fuel cells, microturbine, etc.), that will give these new \"electric\" cars a fuel economy of about 70 MPG (or lower depending on the economy of hybrid cars of the time).", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "gsilva220"}

If the costs of manufacturing EV cars will not fall fast enough, the traditional cars can hold on longer than an S-curve would predict.\n\nIn addition massive EV adoption will be a huge problem for most countries - almost every country imposes various taxes on gasoline, that they do not on electricity.

This translates into $$$, which is what the point of peak oil theory was. Oil would get more expensive to pull from the ground so more and more methods will be created to avoid oil altogether, so the demand drops and te production drops to match.\n\nHere's what we should do: We in the developed world should reduce our oil dependence as rapidly as possible while still producing at current rates. This way, we can export more and more oil to developing countries that still need it, and use the incoming funds to pay for infrastructure overhauls which can further reduce our dependence, and the process accelerates.\n\nThis is roughly how Norway does it. Their green energy and recycling infrastructure was funded in no small part by their oil exports to other european countries. It also helps fund their very generous welfare state, which the US would likely put into other areas such as roads, education, and universal health care while generally keeping the government less invasive than the Nordic model.\n\nBut in this way, we can reap the benefits of oil production, lead the world in alternative energy research, and pull the developing world closer to our level in the process, while still meeting climate change demands.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "WebX"}

Yet possibly the biggest part of it is the fact that big oil has WAY to much influence over politics than any politician is comfortable with.  They are tired of being led around on a leash by big oil and they want it to stop.  A 20 year plan to do that probably sounds pretty good to any career politician.  This is no a conspiracy theory :).  Just common sense backed up by many public statements of politicians who were \"railroaded\" out of office by big oil because they wouldn't play ball.  For those that don't know the \"railroad commission\" is the government agency responsible for oil regulation in the USA.  Why there isn't an \"oil commission\" for such a massive part of our economy is just another layer of confusion to make it harder to people to see whats really going on with the policies in place.\n\nRegardless of the motivations the world is about to have a massive shift towards electric and self driven vehicles.  China is actually leading the charge in that regard as it pertains to government policy while the United States now thx almost entirely to Elon Musk and his supporters is leading the charge commercially.  I have no doubt that one of the next 5 giga factories he says he will announce the locations of soon will be in China.  Once it is up and running then China will likely closely mirror the US progress towards replacing their vehicle fleets with fully electric.\n\nSoon after electric and self driven cars prove themselves over gasoline vehicles for safety and fuel economy (how far you can drive for a given amount of money gas or electric) almost all other car manufacturers will follow suit and start developing their own versions of electric and self driven vehicles.  This is as inevitable as people putting light bulbs in their houses.  I'm sure there was a time when most people thought.  \"Why would I need a light bulb.  I can just burn a candle for light\".  Gasoline cars are the candle and its about to go out.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  Oil production is in NO risk of \"loosing the billions invested in it\"  There will be enough of a tapering off period over several decades that the existing equipment which has been invested into the oil industry will basically be used up.  The only thing that will happen is that production of new oil related equipment will start to tapper off.  The industry will then lead towards producing replacement parts for a few years and finally the consolidated industry remaining will simply be significantly scaled down.\n\nOn the bright side because of the influx of electric cars into the fleet gasoline demand will soon reach a point where it begins to actually decline.  From this point on there will be no justifiable reason to increase the gasoline prices and we may even see them decrease before finding a gas pump to fill up at is as rare as an electric car charging station is now.  But we are talking 2030 at the earliest for all that.\n\nPeople will lose their jobs and industries will shift.  Factories that once made oil rigs will start making wind turbines or solar panels.  Or more likely just the support structures for them.  It won't be the end of the world.  It won't even be a new world.  It will just change a little and so slowly that the most conservative of us can keep up.  So as they say in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy... \"DON\"T PANIC\"", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "K162KingPin"}

An electric motor efficiency cannot be greater than 98%. A battery storage system will have to wait until nano carbon tubes are a reality and we have a capacitor that stores enough for a 2 hour heavy payload flight - but by then we will have run out of oil, so moot point.\n\nThe third industrial application, which burns more than you would think, is common as backup generation in the first world, but in Asia it is common to be the primary means of electrical generation (Thailand is a major example). The other alternatives are just as messed up and significant cost which the governments certainly won't be spending to make a change they cannot see or benefit from.\n\nBut above and beyond these considerations is a huge primary reason the oil companies won't be going out of business anytime in the next 30 years...  The plastics industries!!!  where did you imagine plastic comes from ? Nearly half of the oil production globally goes to making the very parts you want to make your EV's out of, so they are nice and light. Carbon fibre is an especially petroleum concentrated derivative - both the fibres and resin.\n\nSo while I am agreeing with cars being electric, I don't foresee these other more important sectors dying off before oil does.\n\nThe alternative may be to have miniature depleted nuclear fuel based engines with short half-life ration sources that need refilling, so that no major bomb is created (accidentally or intentionally).\n\nHappy for someone to disagree with the above, but would like a reasoned explanation other than troll-baiting.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Michael Foransich"}

The effect \"range\" of, for example the Toyota Camry 2017 is 400 miles in the city and 560 on the highway. With a fuel up time of less than 5 minutes to get a full tank.\n\nNow compare that to electric cars. Where you have less range and longer wait to charge up. So you have to charge up more often and it all takes longer.\n\nThe fastest chargers are the Tesla Superchargers, which are only for Teslas. And they still are very slow.  Half an hour for 200 miles, that is weak. Everyone else has to charge for hours to reach 200 miles of driving.\n\nAnd finally frequent fast charging leads to the battery losing it's maximum capacity.

{"cid": "UghQOgYiFgvoiXgCoAEC", "text": "And directly the first sentence is a lie. The world is not running out of oil. Actually we have an overproduction and we discover on a yearly base new fields with oil and gas. Just recently the gigantic gas fields in Egypt. Next lie is the environmental friendly electric cars. The directly eco balance of a conventional car and an electrical one is clearly for conventional. It starts with the battery in the latter ones. Tons of hazardous waste is produced here. It's already enough if we produce this shit with smartphones and Co. By car the scale is much bigger and worse. By a lifespan over 15 years you have to change roughly 5 to six times some hundred kilo of batteries to keep the promised capacity. I even don't talk about the costs... From an environmental point of view this is insane because batteries are highly toxic. A conventional car is easy to recycle because nearly all parts can be used again. Send it over to a steal mill and you have a new car. And than... Even if we are in an oil flood since never before... What do you need to producr electrical cars? Rare earth's. I'm opposite to oil there is a reason why it's called rare earth. It's in the name dummy. We are simply not able to cover at this point a world production of cars which are powered with batteries. Why? There is not enough rare earth's existing as well as not enough mines. I save myself at this point the time which impact the production of it has if it's mined in open pits. Next point. From where comes the energy for the cool electrical cars? I know, from the socket in the wall. In reality it comes from power plants. And yes we talk here about coal,  nuclear and gas powered stations. Means  we must burn fuel somewhere else to transport it to the point where we need it. But there is always a loss. If you produce, as well if you transport as well if you charge to name some of them. Compared to that a modern conventional engine powered with gas or diesel is much more efficient and losing less energy. That's called physic. If they would stop to teach propaganda at schools someone in the 5th grad should figure that out. It's the energy laws. And the discovery is a bit older as this new age bio hazard bullshit. And the last point. If you think all this nice cars are powered with so called clean energy. This is bullshit. Not one conventional power plant is switched of because of it. Not a single one. A modern civilization can't relly on energy which is the product of accident and the mood of mother nature. Do you really believe you can power your care to any given time with wind or sun? Oh please, grow up and take a step outside of your save space. At nivht there is no sun, wind is not blowing  constantly as well as sun is not shinning full over the whole year.  What your propagandists are not willing to tell you..... In the same time were you so called clean energy is produced..  All power plants are still online and produce. Simply because otherwise the grid would collapse. So means we build up a totally useless and less efficient network of moody energy production and burn in the same time precious energy into thin air.

According to this study the US would require a 30% increase in power generation. That's a huge investment which I doubt President Trump will be making. It even appears that the EV is not so green when you look at the whole economics and environmental impact. It is fairly well known that an electric vehicle on the East Coast is actually more polluting than a gasoline car once the power generation is taken into account. These are all points to consider.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "stephen preest"}

Their governments aren't run by oil companies.\n- Tesla plans to reach 500K cars per year a lot faster. I hope they succeed because I want a Model 3 too, and they have around 500K preorders to fulfill before I get a chance.\n- EVs will take off much faster then the video expects. In a few years EVs will be much better than gas guzzlers in practically every way, including price. Modern internal combustion engines are insanely complex and therefore very expensive, mostly because emissions and fuel economy. And they will never be cheap again because of that. Electric engines on the other hand are very simple and cheap, and battery prices are dropping at an insane rate. Ranges are now comfortable, and charging networks are growing exponentially. People are more and more open to EVs, and those who tried them never look back. Also some cities may ban diesel cars as early as 2020. Because of these things demand will explode (the 500K Tesla Model 3 preorder is a clear sign of this). In developed countries a lot of people buy a new car every 3 to 5 years, and few people drive more than 10-15 years old ones in any decent country. So 50% EV by 2040 isn't a radical idea, I think it's a pessimistic prediction. It could easily be 90%.\n- The price of oil is controlled by the US and Saudi Arabia by adjusting production rates, and by invading other oil rich countries. Prices dropped recently for two reasons. First, they wanted to hurt Russia, which depends heavily on it's oil export revenue.

This means the car needs to be available for everyday living, which equals 100-150miles a day, but it will also need to be capable of going the distance on family road trips. 300 miles in a 4-4h30min ride is very doable for many folks, but many don't really want to drive beyond that amount of time.\nIf cars get to the 300 mile range, recharge quickly, and be competitively priced [by this I mean within 2-3k dollars more at most], the S curve will occur, but not until those criteria are met.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "William Plain"}

This assumption is not true and shows Adam's lack of keeping up with the latest trends. \n\nSolar panels, predominantly for commercial use, are now a far cheaper source of electricity production than is coal. In fact panels are so cheap right now that many companies are selling older stock at a loss so they may increase production of the more efficient upgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the idea \"we are all going to go out and get a new car more often\" [I am paraphrasing there] is also a fallacy. Folks will go get a new electric once their current combustion engine vehicle dies and that is only if electrics end up being competitively priced. Once production gets going full tilt we may see combustion engine costs come down, with dealers having huge sales to get rid of archaic options.\n\nHe is right about the carbon costs of making electrics though. They are simply more painful on the front end, but the savings on the back end are extremely high. \n\nAdd the carbon savings to the toppling of terrorist organizations like Exxon Mobile, the Koch brothers, the Saudi, Iranian, Russian empires, and the world at large will be a much safer, cleaner, freer, and happier place.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "William Plain"}

Lets look at this the scientific way. CO^2 is released in the air(doesn't matter where from). What happens to the CO^2? Does the CO^2 stay in the air for millions, or billions of years? NO, see nature has a way of using CO^2 it is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). Fuel from photosynthesis can be reused as a energy.\n\nWhen was the last time you drank something with soda water in it? Do you die from all the emissions from the soda water? Because soda water has water and CO^2 in it, and that is the same emissions from natural gas.\n\nNow coal which is what we use mostly use now to produce electricity for these electric cars isn't as clean as natural gas is. Coal is littered with toxins both to dig it out, and when burning it. Coal technology has had some break throws to clean up some of the toxins. But, even gas and diesel has less toxins than coal. And 65% is wasted do to energy lose that I have mentioned, but have avoided.\n\nBut, even with Obama pushing wind power the future prediction of wind power is still less than 10% of the total energy use in the USA by 2020. And you still have energy lose that you have been avoiding.\n\nActually, we are just throwing lithium ion batteries in the trash that either get in the air, because of the outer casing ruptures, or leaks in our ground water. Companies aren't recycling lithium ion batteries because of the economics, and people like you don't think it is a big issue environmentally, and would rather throw it in a land fill hoping that it doesn't leak in to ground water, or burn in the air. Lithium ion batteries when the outer casing is exposed the lithium ion has a chemical reaction with the oxygen in the air, and throws the toxins in the air.\n\nWhen is it a good time to recycle all this electronic crap.... When you can't drink the water? When fish have to much toxins in them that you can't eat them... \"Its a repetitively small problem.\" are you kidding.\n\nWe need to get back to the nature way of thinking.

There are some Tesla Superchargers already that utilize solar so any whining about coal and the associated pollution will dry up. There are some regions of the country now that are 100% renewables (Oregon I think is one state). As for the batteries, not to worry,¬†lithium is recyclable and the Gigaplant in Nevada is designed to facilitate that process but they can also use the batteries¬†as backup storage or primary storage¬†for off grid applications after their usable lifespan is over. The Tesla Powerwall is simply that and is currently available. For comparison, the Powerwall is available with a 10Kw battery and a Nissan Leaf has a 24 Kw.¬†The cost to just refine crude oil into gasoline takes as much electricity as it does to power an electric car 20 miles. This is before it's trucked from the distillery to the gas station. Where¬†does that electricity come from? Don't get me started on fuel cells. To complete the comparison in all fairness, you should really consider the entire impact of manufacturing, delivery, recycling, etc for both means of transportation.

But electrics can be powered on anything. Get some solar panels on your roof or get your energy from an eco energy company (in the UK we have a few) and you're driving with zero (or close to it) running footprint (but you still have a bit of manufacturing footprint). Here's one of many people's attempts to quantify the long-term environmental benefits of EVs over ICE cars: http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electric-cars-green\n\n2) Tesla's batteries are virtually 100% recyclable - https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/blog/teslas-closed-loop-battery-recycling-program\n\nThe trick when thinking about EVs and making them as efficient as possible is to remember that our power grid can draw power from many different sources, so it's up to us to give our money to providers who contribute to the national grid using renewables. This is how we change the world. Your DOLLARS are your votes. Change the infrastructure and you change the world.

Disrupting the oil market can have disastrous consequences. There is a reason why oil is known as the \"Black Gold\". Oil is not just used in cars. It is also used in medicine, transporting of goods (think of big trucks, planes and huge cargo ships that cannot be easily replaced by electric motors), mining, farming, fertilizer, manufacturing of essential chemicals, and the list goes on. Disrupting oil means disrupting those industries. A power station may be more efficient, but the transport of large amount of current is not feasible economically (look up demand costs and cost upgrading electric infrastructure). A solution that keeps getting thrown around is solar panels. Solar panels are great in theory, but only in theory.  Solar panels have a limitations placed by their materials. (Of course people are trying to think of unique ideas to break through these limits.) In the grand scheme of things, putting solar panels on everything does not solve our energy needs. There are too many constraints and it's not a good economical solution (the costs are too high). (I'll let google give you a more complete solution.)

The big one is getting off meat (at least 'real' meat) as animal agriculture has the biggest footprint of anything we do, requires acres of rainforest to be destroyed every minute, consumes about half of the food we grow worldwide, half the medicine we make, half the water we have access to, and is just inherently and systematically cruel.\n\nSwitching planes to electric is also tricky but not impossible. Elon Musk talks often about a project he's planning for a vertical take-off and landing electric passenger jet. Hopefully he'll start on that in about ten years' time once everything's ticking over at Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nShips are also not going to be easy, but it's not impossible. Here's a project the US Navy is nearly finished on which will lead to other things: http://cleantechnica.com/2013/11/05/us-navy-launches-new-all-electric-zumwalt-destroyer/\n\nAnd lastly, there's biofuel. By growing the plant and then harvesting it and burning it there is actually virtually zero carbon footprint. I know that seems silly when you're clearly burning diesel and releasing CO2, but it doesn't matter if the CO2 was sequestered a month ago rather than millions of years ago. The problem with fossil fuels is that we're burning millions of years' build-up all at once. Biofuel totally negates that problem. \n\n\nBosch are doing away with all engine-powered tools and making everything electric including lawn mowers, chainsaws, hedge trimmers etc. The result is a quieter machine that lasts way longer and doesn't require oil for lubrication. This whole idea that we'll always need fossil fuels to lubricate things is silly because the main things that need lubrication are of course engines, which disappear when you convert to electric. The few things that still need oil can easily use synthetic. In fact, you probably have synthetic (not fossil) oil lubricating your car's engine right now and don't know it.\n\nLego are going totally green and if they can do it so can other plastics manufacturers. \n\nIn terms of infrastructure, no one is saying it's going to be easy but it's still going to happen.

You can try to increase tax revenue by other means, or maybe better to reduce costs.  There are plenty of costs incurred with the gas cars that need to be recovered by taxes.  These include the direct costs such as traffic, health, climate, water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, crashes, & indirect costs such as $Trillion war in the middle east securing oil assets.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "jim jon"}

I hope that you're fuming anger doesn't cause you to continue making yourself look bad.\n\nFor a battery:\n1. The electrodes dissolve in the chemical reaction. ¬†When they‚Äôre gone, the battery is dead.\n2. The amount of energy the battery supplies is determined by the amount of chemicals in the battery (‚ÄòD‚Äô cells last longer than ‚ÄòAAA‚Äô cells).\n3. In some cases (re-chargeable batteries), the chemicals can be restored by reversing the current and restoring the original chemicals, but over time the chemicals will eventually lose this capacity.\n\nFor a Fuel Cell:\n1. The electrodes are not consumed: As long as fuel is supplied, the cell will generate a voltage: it won‚Äôt ‚Äòrun down‚Äô.\n2. The amount of energy is determined by the amount of gas reactants. (Same as liquid reactants for a combustion engine).\n3. It can supply energy continuously (like a combustion engine).\n\nIF YOU ARE ARE STILL COMMITTED TO IGNORANCE: This article from the \"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology Volume 26\" it goes over all of the pro/con differences between both technologies. You'll notice that their compare Fuel Cells to petroleum fuels at times.¬†http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.79.4690&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\n\"not pure\" (You) \"they can't find a way to produce it on a large scale cheaply\" (Me). I wonder why I said that? Please don't make me explain how what you just described directly relates to my initial response -_-\n\nSidenote: I don't care about Nissan. I care about results and progress irregardless of brand. The main reason batteries are in higher favor right now is because of the lack of regulations on it in comparison to Fuel Cells combined with the social/cultural ease of relate ability to battery technology (not this strange new things that could explode (even though poor battery architecture can also explode)).", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "N A"}
{"cid": "Ugi4IV3gUWpH2XgCoAEC.8Afz0617moZ8ApARn3f_XI", "text": "+David Foster I'm going to stop you right where you claimed batteries are 'tossed in the trash'.  Clearly you know very, very little about the battery market, so please, just stop talking. \n\nHint:  Automotive batteries are sodding recycled or given a second-life.  There's too many  rare materials in EV batteries for any sane businessman to just 'throw them in the trash'.  The current 18650 cells Panasonic and LG chem are providing for most of the EV industry are designed to be, for the most part, recycled and/or repurposed when they reach vehicle EoL (end of life), which, given the current cell performance we're seeing in existing EVs today, can easily last the vehicle's typical lifetime.\n\nOh, and hydrogen fuel cell cars ARE electric cars.  It's also a kind of electric car. It runs on a motor powered by electricity. What makes it different from a battery-electric vehicle (or BEV) is where the electricity comes from. Instead of a battery, a hydrogen fuel cell car generates its power ON-BOARD from the fuel cell.  \n\nThis is the primary reason why a hydrogen fuel cell car is an electric car:  The fuel cell generates electricity, which is then excess-stored in an on-board battery or used to directly power the wheels via use of a DC or AC motor.  So, just like a battery-car the drivetrain is the same; an electric motor.  The only difference is you're generating that electricity on-site instead of at a power station (or solar panels).  If it runs on electricity, it's electric.  It's that simple.\n\nGasoline cars, on the other hand, are not electric. Your comment \"With that logic anything which has an electric motor would be an electric car including Gas\" is utterly moronic because, quite simply, that's not how gasoline cars work.  They don't HAVE an electric motor to drive the wheels.  The energy propulsion that drives the shaft, transmission and in turn powers the wheels is generated by combustion occurring in the engine cylinders.  Gas cars, simply put, do not use an electric motor at all.  The thrust (the driving motion) is generated as a result of miniature internal explosions that happen at a high frequency within the engine.  This is generating motion through combustion directly.  Now yes, some of that energy does go to the vehicle's inverter, but that only helps power the car's electrical systems such as the radio and headlights.  The actual powertrain for the wheels is 100% powered by burning fuel.\n\nPerhaps the biggest failing of your entire logic is how you speak in the present:  How the cars currently require X sized batteries or Y materials.  Why else do you think scientists are working to develop better solutions?  If people like you ran the world, technology would hardly progress because you would always consider things in terms of the 'here and now' instead of the 'where they could be in the future'.\n\nEver heard the saying \"Rome wasn't built in a day\"?\nAlso ever heard the saying \"you're a fucking clueless idiot and should stop talking about things you know next to nothing about?\"", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Will Davis"}

It's also common knowledge that the extent of these ranges between States and countries. However, it is also plainly obvious that when the recycling plant is down the material goes straight to the landfill in the mean time, AND most people don't follow proper procedures for battery recycling (especially on the individual level). HENCE acid leaching of which there are plenty of scientific articles on and examples of.\n\nYou just said \"fuel cell cars ARE electric cars\" and then followed it up with examples of how it's different. For someone so righteous you contradict yourself a lot. I suggest you look at the scientific article I posted in the previous comment. Also, I guess by your previous logic that hybrid cars and any other fuel based vehicle which generates electricity as a byproduct = electric car. Why call them hybrid, fuel cell, or some gasoline cars (depending on the technology it uses) when they could all just be called electric? Heck unless you're using only diesel you require generating electricity for a spark plug! The combustion would not happen without an electric current!\n\nYou're \"here and now\" observation is false. I had even given estimates for when the technology would be ready in the future based on where it has been and where it is now. I am only opposed to modern battery based cars not where it could be in the future. The amount of CO2 being mitigated is small compared to the environmental damage produced in the production and disposal of modern batteries + the supermajority of electric sources to recharge these batteries are fossil fuel based. There will be an increase in mining/drilling for batteries for powering and making them given the current energy infrastructure. Hydrogen fuel cells would require a far less impact on the environment in the production, use, and disposal.\n\nThe main argument is that Hydrogen Fuel Cells = Electric Cars. I say that's false. There are a multitude of differences between them!\n\nYou know, that's a great quote and I think you should keep it as a reminder for yourself \"you're a fucking clueless idiot and should stop talking about things you know next to nothing about?\" Doesn't it just make you smile at the sudden realization that the quote was made for you?
