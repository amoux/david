Here in Europe we rely a lot on diesel passenger cars and they do have less CO2 emission comparing to petrol (gasoline),  but they have other worse emissions (DieselGate). Now with introducing of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF, AdBlue) in most passenger Diesel Cars those emissions are down about 95% but still not zero. \n\n\nNow to this video -  those Start/Stop systems (that EE also reviewed) are major backdoor for manufacturers to lower those emissions in the vehicle's data sheet. The Previous NEDC test cycle was a joke. And those Start/Stop systems abused it. With the new WLTP things are better but still not good enough. Those systems actually (as EE told)  do not work efficiently for fast stops (less than 7-10 seconds, depending on the car) . So moving in a traffic jam before a roundabout or some other situations (that in Europe are a lot) that you stop your car, wait a couple of seconds (less than 7-10)  and move again, that system uses more fuel thus more CO2 and other emissions. That system is mandatory turned ON when a car is started, as it is regulated and tested in that way, so most users use it. Other users turn OFF the system every time, not because of the environment but for discomfort (especially in diesel cars as starting there is more noticeable). Also this system works when specific criterias are met. In example does not work when the car is cold on cold weather with the heater ON or when it is hot and you put your AC on max, or your battery is low on power, or the secondary battery is low on power (after 5-7-10 consecutive stops it will not work in most cars) or it stops working in middle of the stop cycle because of those criterias. So you actually do not know when this system will benefit in real life and one thing for sure it will not work for a 100% of the time it is expected to. So the car will 100% not reach those CO2 emission for the entire life of the vehicle. With full electric this 7-10 seconds do not matter, with hybrid pretty much the same. This will not depend on the type of way that electricity is produced for the car it will just rely on the fact that electric cars (even hybrids) are more suitable for that type of traffic. This should further reduce the time to reach this emission equalization point (depending on the driving cycle).

It is estimated that between 150 and 180 billion m3 of natural gas gets flared every year. That's equivalent to 330,000,000 to 396,000,000 metric tons of CO2 just from flaring every year.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Michael Schulze"}

The average vehicle in America produces more horsepower than the leaf and is therefore an unfair comparison. If you want to compare vehicles on the same footing (I know you didn't intend to) you must compare them on equal capabilities. An F-350 can do way more than a leaf but will also produce far more emissions. When I personally buy a car it is for a purpose not specifically for emissions. If I want something to get me to and from work that is it I won't be looking at a truck. As well if I am looking to tow and other things of that nature I will not even consider a leaf. I believe emission control is good and useful but practicality needs to be considered. If the leaf fits my needs, is cost competitive, and is lower in emissions I would buy it. I would think an accurate comparison would be to compare the leaf and an ICE competitor to the leaf and compare the lifetime emissions. Same with the 100 kWh battery (ie Tesla).

The ICE vehicle would be equally recyclable as the EV except for the batteries. Lithium, cobalt, nickel etc cannot just be dumped in landfill and would be highly labour intensive to deal with.\nAlso, look at the overall vehicles lifespan: I drive a 1989 Range Rover V8 3.5 (215 cubic inch) BUT and its a big but, its dual fuel. It starts up on petrol but after a few minutes it switches over to LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) which produces between 40-60% less co2. Coupled with it already being 30 years old and still has plenty of life left in it, compare that to buying a new EV approximately every ten years. So to date, my one ICE has outlived THREE EVs. Yes it has a modestly large engine (by European standards! ;-).) but unfortunately all modern ICE vehicles are built with a very restricted lifespan, partly dependant on what the current bonkers politicians decide on acceptable limits.\nJust remember, when an ICE falls foul of those limits it is just scrapped which surely is wasteful when it's being replaced with a new car, irrespective of it being EV or ICE.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "bushmanpm"}

The basic components of an electric car are CHEAPER than a gasoline engine car.  The process of fabricating motors is \"mature tech\" going back well over 100 years and is far, FAR less intricate and complex than making the zillion or so parts in the modern ICE.  Then comes the MOST expensive part of a ICE car...that automatic transmission which has thousands of precious parts, with servos and actuators and sensors, wires, oil, and layers of precision cut gear sets that must be precisely assembled yet can so easily be destroyed in a few thousand miles in the hands of the American abuser-consumer.  By comparison an electric motor has ONE moving part.  The single-speed \"transmission\" is a fancy reference to a simple, planetary gear reduction to drive the wheels.  An electric car has no fuel system, no coolant hoses, no starter motor, no oil-filled crank-case, no oil-filled transmission, no spark plugs, no coil, no high-energy ignition system replete with wires and connectors.  No radiator, no need for antifreeze, no exhaust manifold, no catalytic converter, no mufflers, no Y-pipes, no EGRs and sensors, no complex feedback look ECM system to maximize fuel economy - which still sucks consider the basic engine is only 15% efficient at converting gasoline into motive power.\nThe so-called high cost of batteries is used to justify ripping off early adopters, and this allows the obtuse crowd to pretend buying an electric car is only about initial cost and how long it takes to offset the higher cost electric - usually comparing economy priced ICE cars to electrics.   On the other hand, compare the acquisition cost of what MOST idiots are out there splurging on - $60K trucks, and full-size SUVs, and $35-$70K sport sedans, and there is NO comparison to any electric.\nThe electric car driver gives up nothing in performance since a motor delivers full torque instantly.  An electric can also recover significant energy while decelerating. \n\nThe other day I was calculating how much it cost for me to make my daily, 77 mile commute in my Kona electric compared to my wife's Santa Fe Limited and was stunned to discover that whereas my Kona cost a surprising $3.86 (Tier 1 PG&E) to go the distance, my wife's thirsty (but more fuel efficient than all the full-size trucks clogging the highways) Santa Fe cost $11.98!  That's a whopping 310 PERCENT MORE to drive just 77 miles!\nMuch is made of the fact that even a large battery pack such as the 64 kWh unit in the Kona electric is \"only\" equal to about 2 gallons of gasoline due to the lower energy density of a battery versus liquid gasoline, but another way of looking at it is that the Kona will go 300 miles on those \"2 gallons of gas\" while the wife's SUV will consume 12 or more gallons of gasoline.\nAlso, while nobody has any control of how gasoline is sourced - they must pay the price whatever it is.  ELECTRONS can be sourced from many different places!  Taking one's home solar drastically reduces grid usage, and adding a powerwall can make the average home electron \"net positive\" in that it NEVER pulls power from the grid!  Then, the cost to fuel one's electric car is \"free\" essentially.  Granted all this costs money, but people are going to convert to solar anyway, so adding an electric car makes MORE sense than adding yet another ICE car!", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Richard Kilibreaux"}

I assume a 30kwh electric car isn't the average electric car in the US either (you might find a smaller average in Europe though but it is still going to be a bigger car). If you were to compare the average CO2 output of a car the size of this theoretical 30kwh electric car, something like a VW Polo you might discover you need to drive your electric car for far longer to break even on CO2. You might even have trouble doing that at all in some states if you account for battery replacements over time.\n\nThe 100kwh comparison is a bit of a mixed bag fro me. I'd assume the average electric car would be somewhere in between so this could be biased towards the combustion engines somewhat. Then again, your average numbers come from the US where big gas guzzling pick up trucks are still a thing. :P Europe paints a different picture though. When for example they compared the average electric vs gas cars in Germany they concluded it would take around 100.000 km (62k miles) of driving on their 14.000km (8700 mile) a year average leading to a little over 7 years to break even. \n\n\nNow I'm not saying the electric car isn't better for emisions but this is a highly debated subject without one clear answer. If you do open the can of worms and dive deeper into the rabbit hole you'd have to take into account many things like the logistics of production (the old folktale of a hummer being more enviromentally friendly than a prius because it's parts were all made locally and didn't need to be shipped from all over the world for example). Logistics of the fuel (piping and shipping of oil and it's refinement impact). Different spare part usage between the cars and their related enviromental impact, different tyre wear due to electric cars being heavier, impending lithium shortages that may lead to limited use of batteries in other fields and 5000 orso other factors that all factor in to the question of \"Is an electric car worse for the enviroment?\". \nIt really is impossible to truely answer this currently because we don't have all the data we would need. \n\nInteresting subject to do research on though but due to the limited scope and data of all research done into this so far this discussion is going to go on for a looooong time before we have one solid answer.

Like toxic materials used to make both, the lifespan and how much it will require and release in total? Secondly, I'd like a comparison with new, low consumption models of ICE cars, not the 'average' that includes super old cars, and heck, probably trucks and buses too! Finally, there's the usability issue, in its many aspects - first of all the obvious one about limited range and such, the cut on range in cold weather, the damages from cold charging and use in hot environments... Those all reduce the lifespan and efficiency of electric cars. Next is the question of practical application - how many electric cars can the electric grid in most countries sustain if we are to change now? Kind of the same as the 'solar problem' - the peak production hours of solar happen to be the hours when the need for electricity is the lowest, which is why we can make less use of it, this also comes down to how bad even our current batteries are as we can't really store electricity in any sustainable and efficient way.. But back to the topic - most people come back from work around the same time which, if we switch to electric, would create a huge spike load on the grid in those hours that the current electric grid in most places probably can't maintain. This could somewhat be offset by having chargers at workplaces, solar energy and solar panels on roofs, but i still have my doubts about how sustainable and possible it is right now for us to make a big shift to electric.. Hopefully there's a breakthrough soon in battery technology so both our cars and electric grids can properly benefit from solar, but for now, i still have my doubts.. \n\n\nNot to mention there's a lot of things we can do to massively cut down co2 emissions that we don't do at all, and can't even CONSIDER doing with our current mindset - for example making electronics more expensive, modular, and long lasting (cellphones for example) so that we don't need to change them so often (also change the mindset that makes us WANT to change them that often too), a lot of other stuff too, clamp down on divorce courts and welfare that have become a business ENCOURAGING people to get divorces (divorces boost co2 emissions too as there's more need to drive around, more need for toys and other things that would otherwise be owned in one copy at one home), clamp down on taxes, the government's ability to print money and government spending (national debt IS overspending, overspending is overuse of resources and increased pollution), cut international aid and stop importing third worlders everywhere around the world (they have more kids both at home and immigrated if given money, why does everyone cry about overpopulation while actually ENSURING overpopulation by bringing people with high fertility into places where the population was actually NATURALLY decreasing?), stop business and support with China (the leader in pollution and the main incentive in overspending and increase in cheap products supporting the hyper consumerism culture)... I'd love to cut down pollution and even stop it, but we'll never be able to at this rate as no one's looking at it in any way aside the selfish and idiotic approach of 'the magic pill', something that will just solve everything (in this case technology) without us having to change anything or lift a finger.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Mk.z"}

People complain about it because they can, not because they take roadtrips every week of the month.\nSo does producing all these hundred engine parts for gas cars then pumping fuel, refining fuel, transporting fuel (by the same gas powered trucks) and then burning it harm the environment more?

Many industrial vehicles and machines, used for mining and manufacturing are classically diesel operated.  Caterpillar, for instance, has begun making machines powered by batteries, but the vast majority are still diesel.  Power grids can be solar, wind, hydroelectric or nuclear, so grid emissions can be nearly eliminated.  If we attacked every aspect of the remaining cycles, how many emissions COULD be eliminated with redesign?  What is the minimum amount of emissions possible?  Gasoline cars HAVE to burn combustible fuels for operation.  Electric car do not, but certain chemical processes may not be avoidable in the production of the batteries and other components, even if all the mechanical labor of production can be converted to electric.

That question is this; Is man-made CO2 an actual environmental threat. The science is not settled. \n\nFirst of all, the whole 97% consensus was debunked long ago, but people refuse to acknowledge it. Do your research on this and you will find it to be absolutely true. Any rationally thinking individual with a little critical thinking skill can figure this out. This was the lie/catalyst that started all the so called green programs. So, after you realize this, the rest is irrelevant, but for those that buy into all of this green nonsense with their wallets emptying into their governments hands, I will present a few more realities.\n\nSecondly, man made CO2 is only a very minute fraction of the actual naturally occurring CO2 amounts that are already in the atmosphere. Furthermore, is a little warming such a bad thing? If it gets warmer by a few degrees, less energy is needed to heat all of our buildings, Agriculturally speaking, warmer is definitely better because the warmer it is, the more it rains, not to mention natural vegetation will naturally thrive in warmer temps, which in turn will consume the CO2. It is a self correcting system we have here on earth. Warmer temperatures equals more plants, more animals, and more life in general which in turn means we have a \"greener\" planet in every sense of the word.. The colder it gets, the less life there is, period, which is not green. \n\nLastly,, and this is the most important one, is this so called global warming going to have catastrophic outcomes. That is another factor that seems to just get glossed over when people debate this topic. Every prediction model used to scare people,   turned out to be completely wrong All this nonsense that these doomsday, fear mongering, green machines spout on about is merely to create more and more green, money that is.

This means that you have to throw away the old one and put a brand new one in it every few years, or the max range will drop over time. Btw I appreciate your video, but I also think that this is kind of specific for the US. In europe our cars need much less fuel, because fuel is more expensive and thus we need to and can build powerful engines without using 20000 Liters of displacement which ofc reduces emissions. So if your population drives fuel efficient cars and not only Pickups and muscle cars (I exaggerate a bit) it might, or rather will be a different story. And if you really want low output of C02, you should go for 2.0l or smaller Diesel engines. There is ofc the N0x downside to consider, but overall it's the most efficient engine. \n\n\nOh and btw. lets say there are only electric cars out there, you need much more electric energy thus also increasing the need for it. And it's really hard (I think it's impossible) to produce that much on top for all these vehicles and without using nuclear or fossil fuels. So I stick at least for europe with it. I would say that electric cars are not better for the enviroment, maybe worse if you consider all this lithium waste. Again, for the US it might be a different story.

They are full of highly toxic chemicals and are classified as hazardous waste.  It cost money to dispose of the old batteries and since they are new to the market there can not be any real data on the environmental impact of thousands of dead batteries showing up in our landfills.   Another huge factor you are ignoring completely, every summer municipalities around the country have to regulate power consumption due to overtaxing of our electrical grid, if everyone starts trying to run electric cars, more power plants will need to be produced, and upgrades to our power grid will be required, there is additional CO2 emmision that needs to be calculated in.  There is also a cost of production of the electric car, they are way more expensive than a gas powered car and the profit margin on them is non existent which is why no dealers want to sell them. In fact if it were not for Governement incentives, tax credits, redistribution of our tax dollars, they would not be able to sell a single one. Oil refinement has become so efficient over the years that there is not a drop of a barrel of oil wasted, as the oil is refined and separated into layers, each layer is used for a specific purpose.  The raw layers are used for making Deisel and Jet Fuel (largest portion of the barrell) then the lighter layer below is used for heating oil, kerosine etc. then Gasoline, then natural gas, plastics, paints, and so on.  If you  remove one of the purposes which oil is used for then that whole layer becomes waste byproduct and must be dispossed of somehow.   If people want to argue, Leave the oil in the ground and just don't tap into it, well news flash, oil is lighter than water and will eventually find its way to the surface of the earth in the form of large tar pits like we had before we started using it.

As you pointed out, the more range and speed your electric car has, the less environmental benefit it has.  That could change as electric cars improve, but like most green technology, it is just not there yet and probably won't be for some  years, no matter how badly environmentalists want it to be otherwise.   If we really want to improve the environment with real technology that works now, we should be moving toward natural gas powered vehicles.  I might also point out that the gains that have been made in cleaner electricity in recent years have almost all come because of the increase in the use of natural gas, NOT because of wind and solar.

In the US, not all electricity comes from nuclear powerplants (Only 19,7% according to. By the way, nuclear powerplants don't produce a lot of greenhouse gases. The problem with them is disposing of the nuclear materials after they are being used because they are still radioactive. Yes, the range of electric cars decreases in winter (up to 50%) so that is something to consider when considering buying an electric car, but I don't know where you got that \"heating up the car rakes forever,\" because there's no difference between the time to warm the interior of a gasoline powered car and an electric car. I don't think you understand what types of cars you're talking about, because a Prius is a hybrid, not an electric. You don't even plug it in (except for the Prius Prime and the Prius Plug-in.) Yes, with an electric car, you're electricity bill will increase, but you won't buy any gas anymore and it is definitely cheaper. \n\nThat said, the cost of owning an electric car will depend on where you live, how long you drive, etc. For most daily commutes, an electric car is a good environmental and financial decision.

I like the idea of a double drive mode/ electric and gas-/ for various needs and situations. I found this video very informative and helpful.  But for me - Even though I like new technology and features in cars - a lot,  I feel an All electric car still falls way short of practical.  No infrastructure in the US to support this yet. Like hi res TV and no channels or CDs in hi res for it or a MAC with no software.  Eventually it worked out(mostly).  I'm ready but waiting to switch.  I'm not hearing much about the cost of a level 2 charging station for home, where most people would charge.  This is a MUST have to even consider and electric car.  Cost of install and charger - $1500 to $2500 if you have a nice garage or driveway for location.  Furthermore, even though electric cars work better than you would think; living in a cold area of the U.S., they do take a big hit keeping them plugged to keep the battery warm and to keep the car warm and defrosted while driving.  The ICE car with its wasteful heat loss, like old light bulbs you could cook on, do payoff better in the cold weather in some cases.   I feel we are close to the switch over to electric cars, I love the idea and can hardly wait to have one.  Who doesn't like clean fresh air, but I will wait.  Anyhow, I don't know the risk to our water tables with discarded batteries like bad tires.  We need a good bridge and education for the difficult switch over.  Hybrid cars are a great help with moving to all electric cars.  Electric cars are quiet and powerful and exciting.  But still premature. I think they will be or already are better for the environment and will be more efficient soon but not practical yet.  I can't risk not finding a charging station or having one available.  I can't risk being late for work.  I can't risk traveling in very cold weather with my kids and a long trip with so many new and unknown factors do deal with.

If people started to switch to electric cars in volume, all of the equations change.  It takes time to find optimal locations for wind and solar.  Hydro dams alter the environment as well.  All of these can take time to build and meet with lots of resistance and cost quite a bit in terms of fossil fuel to build.  That means if we start to switch to electric cars in volume there are only 2 easy solutions to provide that electricity.  The first is to burn fossil fuels to make the electricity.  This negates the reason to buy an electric car.  The second is to make more nuclear plants.  Unfortunately, nuclear power mishaps (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima) make people resistant to this as well.\nMy point is that until people can decide on a way to significantly increase the production of electricity without burning fossil fuels, switching to electric cars remains a mistake.

You have to produce more than 100kw at the power plant to fill the 100kw Tesla battery.  There are transmission losses to the charging station and losses in charging.  The closer you get to battery capacity the higher the losses.  There is virtually no energy lost from the pump to the fuel for petroleum powered cars.  I am neglecting the energy consumed to get the fuel to the pump or the power plant. Perhaps you could do a video calculate the energy required per btu for both fuel sources.\n\nBut wait there is more.  If you use renewables other than hydro you need continuous spinning backup consuming fuel in case it gets cloudy or the wind drop the wind gets to high since wind turbines operate in a range.  The duty cycle for renewalables is about 30% at best.  The only way you can reliably generate carbon free energy is nuclear.

But what's even more important is that batteries which are considered the least green thing in electric vehicles, when gets too old to be used in a car and need replacement, they can still be used for YEARS in non-traction applications like battery buffer systems which are used more and more and this application is growing rapidly these days. People get it wrong that batteries are broken when they can't be used in traction applications like cars when they work at heavy loads and need to keep parameteres at the highest level all the time. When you use the very same batt as non-traction buffer, you never get heavy load and the parameters drop is not important for a battery working as non-traction energy storage. Even if they have like 70-80% nominal capacity, it's also perfectly fine to use instead of building brand new batteries for this kinda usage. And that actually push the green level even further.

I am slightly biased against anything that comes from the Left side of politics but I am an engineer and I can go with the science or the math. I like how the analysis was done. My best guess is that it is roughly a break even proposition if one compares full electric only to full time combustion. Part of the reason is that you lose a lot of energy as you transfer forms, i.e. fossil fuel to electric through a generator then across a grid to an outlet. Through the outlet to the battery which is chemical energy which once again transforms to mechanical energy, i.e. motion. Here are the numbers, I found:\nburning fossil fuel to get useable heat - about 85% (running a gas-fired water heater, or making steam to power a turbine...some heat goes up the smokestack). \nburning fossil fuel to get electricity - about 33% \nsunlight to electricity in a PV cell - about 10% (sunlight is at least free but unreliable and less useable at northern latitudes)\nputting electrical energy into a battery (charging it) and pulling it back out: about 90% \nconverting electrical energy into mechanical energy with an electric motor about 85% \nTo be fair one has to go past the production of vehicles to the production and transport of energy. We will say that vehicle production is roughly a wash in producing a car with a combustion engine to one with electrical. However, gasoline has to be transported to stations everywhere which takes rails, trucks and pipelines, much less storage. So, fuel to a power plant only is more efficient and then out over a boosted grid to your home and selected recharging stations. This is where electricity should win. You virtually eliminate the transportation and storage but only at the station level. You hook up millions of vehicle to the electric grid and you will have a new problem and huge power demands so power demand would have to ramp up quickly which means more fuel, even coal to power plants versus gas stations. It should still net out very well.\n\nWhat cannot be done is the elimination of combustion engines for a host of reasons. What should also be avoided is the idea that fossil fuels are \"evil\". You have to look at what came before. Before modern power grids people burned raw coal, heating oils, wood and dung. All of these are far worse and less efficient and less reliable that what we have now. The old homes in NJ often still had coal bins or storage for heating oil. So, rather than calling Exxon or Sinclair or others evil understand they are what allowed us to escape the Middle Ages and live in temperature controlled homes and ultimately extend our lifespans. Even the kings of old did not have this.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "GermanCarsRule"}

Using a little math; that means an average car would be 18/25 mpg - pretty poor, right. In truth, the gas equivalent to a Leaf would be something like a Ford Focus, which is EPA rated at 30/40 mpg. Since that is close to double that of the truck, I assume that also cuts CO2 to half of a truck, or about 3 metric tons/yr.  That means the break even point is over 5 years or >60,000 miles.

{"cid": "Ugxqx_uZwNCP-J0GVCd4AaABAg", "text": "So it's more ecological as long as you only mine lithium in the Mad Max's back yard? How much 'middle of nowhere' do you think is really available before you start poisoning & displacing people? Scale matters here. Maybe you could safely mine enough lithium for tens of thousands of EV's, but how about tens of millions of EV's? And after 20 years of making tens of millions of EV's/year, how much more difficult then? Where do you put it when its worn out? Also, how much Nickle and Cobalt is actually available? We think of aluminum as fairly common, but building the ISS actually raised global aluminum prices, because there's a finite supply. How safe is Cobalt? Cobalt is not safe to touch or breath the air near it... and most of the cobalt mining is done in the 3rd world without any regard for the poor and children working in the mines. If the mines were not using humans as disposable fodder, how much more would the materials cost in dollars and emissions to produce? And that's at current production levels. Is there even enough lithium & cobalt available to be mined to sustain a very large EV based auto industry long term? This video takes a kinda superficial approach to these issues.\n\nAlso, assigning the car production a fake number does matter. If the production cost in CO emissions is significantly higher than 10k tons, then the raw % difference in emissions will be a far less significant part of the equation. Most cars are $3000-$5000 worth of raw material, expanded in price by the cost in energy and labor to make them into a car. If a car costs $50,000, and you spend (or don't spend) $2000/year to power it, you'll have to drive it for a very very long time to burn enough petroleum to equal the amount of energy expended making the car. Which is why \"fuel cost\" over the life of a car is only a fraction of the overall cost of car ownership. And while cost and carbon emissions are not the same thing, in the industrialized world, they are somewhat linked.\n\nUntil large-sheet graphene becomes available and cost effective (as in, so long as we are stuck with lithium ion battieries) EV's can only be a limited segment of the automotive marketplace before they suffer crippling issues of supply & demand problems in terms of raw materials, and ecological & humanitarian harm. Graphene though is made from carbon, the only trick is getting it into a molecular shape it doesn't naturally prefer. With (affordable) graphene batteries (should that become something we can accomplish), you could see a gigantic shift in the economy of EV's, and ICE's would be obsolete overnight. Graphene is the holy grail. Without affordable graphene batteries, \"going green\" on a really huge scale is economically unfeasible (and not all that green really), unless you just want to have less industry and let poor people starve. Until graphene, it's \"nice\" to make \"some\" EV's so that the rest of the technology is refined and ready to go.\n\nI live in Illinois, so if I had an EV, even a graphene EV, I'd mainly be trading carbon emissions for nuclear waste. Tomatoes -tomahtoes. And as you mention in West Virgina, an EV would be long dead before you ever recouped the emissions put into making the battery. West virginians can save the planet by avoiding EV's, given their grid power. Arguably that's the fault of the state's approach to the power grid, but it's still true. If you want to play captain planet, then pressuring West Virginaian politicians to explore power generation options would be a much better use of one's time than buying an EV.\n\nCurrently the most ecologically friendly thing a person can do with their driving, is just drive safely. If you buy an EV (even in Idaho, powered by hydro-electric), and then you text while driving through a red light, you've just done more ecological harm than if you bought the most gas-guzzling car available. A totaled car = thousands of tons of manufacturing emissions up in smoke, so to speak.

If there are no plants down wind of the road than the C02 might make it into the upper atmosphere, but not as likely as a giant smoke stack 80 feet in the are pumping out highly concentrated CO2", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Michael Mantion"}

Also, where you live based off the overall environment determines how useful an EV is or is not, when compared to  an IC engine regardless of  how green it may be. It is that usefulness that makes IC engines superior at this point in technological time. 2ndly,  recycling of dead EV batteries is going to be a problem. In some places, it already is. In my area, nearly every recycler won't even accept regular rechargeable cell phone or flashlight batteries ( for example). 1 place does, but charges for disposal. So when 1 needs their EV battery replaced, it must go back to the manufacturer, which can cost the consumer $.  3rdly, You state that EV batteries last more than 5-6yrs, and manufacturers are offering 8 yr warranties, and use this info as a way to measure how an EV pays for itself over time. In many areas of the country, owners are not getting that kind of service life. I have a couple friends that have Prius' . 1 had it's battery replaced after just 3 yrs. The other now needs a 3rd battery, and the cost outweighs the value of the vehicle. I have a friend with a 1st gen Leaf, and that car never got more than 100 miles on a charge. She took it in to Nissan and they replaced it free the 1st time, and it got about 250ish miles per full charge, but soon was back to 100 or less. Nissan is saying once again that it needs a battery and is not going to warranty the new 1. She is considering dumping the car. All in all, I say offer EVs to those who want it but expect limitations at this point. I know manufacturers are pushing the cars, but they still make up only about 4% of the car market.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Adam Trombino"}

Not to mention all the fine dust and other toxic gasses that comes from ICE powered vehicles. Less pollution in the air will also result in less sick people. And when time progresses more energy will be renewable energy generated by wind and solar and such. And on top of that, a Dutch company (founded by some former world champions of the world solar challenge race) is building a car called the Lightyear-one, that will be partially charged with solar panels that are build in the car. They guarantee that even in places that are up north it is possible to drive at least 10.000 km a year charged on solar power. And the technology only improves as time progresses. Graphene is likely to replace lithium batteries in the near future. My estimate is that it won't take 10 years before we see graphene being used to store energy in order to power electric cars. \n\nAlso, all those gears from a gearbox inside a ICE powered car need to be machined, that takes a lot of energy, and that produces a lot of CO2. An electric doesn't need a gearbox at all.  \n\n11 years from now it is no longer allowed to sell new ICE powered cars in my country, it should be banned earlier to my opinion, but it is still a good thing that ICE powered cars are getting banned all together.

If you get the emissions of a car like a Honda Civic and compared it to the car in his video, I get the T factor is much different.\n2) Electricity is greatly reduced (more than 30% in many studies) in Cold Weather. This means that distance and power are much lower than the numbers he used.\n3) He also failed to address the time associated with refilling your gas tank versus a full charge for an electric car OR even a partial charge (keeping in mind the reduced distance for a partial charge).\n4) I think he minimized the life that is affected by the lithium extraction. As a comparison, why not look at how much Hydrogen production affects life where it is produced?  I know‚Ä¶I know‚Ä¶. Hydrogen is not in this comparison but I wonder how that comparison would look like if Hydrogen was used on a retrofitted combustion engine car like the one he is showing?\n5) Glycerin Generators that power Diesel Generators???!!!!   Why not run cars on Glycerin if it is environmentally safe??!!!!  OR‚Ä¶  is this factored into the CO2 output of the electric cars?\n6) I do believe that this is an honest attempt at a comparison.

It seems you have to keep a new electric car for several years to make any significant difference to co2 emissions.\n\n2) Seeing as selling your old gasoline car and buying a new electric car will take approx. 5 years to break even regarding co2 emissions, again unless you plan to keep that electric car for years more past the \"break even\" point, you've done no favors to the environment. So buying a new electric car instead of keeping your gasoline car is a useless effort in terms of co2, as you'd have to keep that electric car for closer to a decade for mother nature to notice you.\n\nRemember, there's no point just breaking even, you've got to keep the electric car for a couple more years past break even point, otherwise you've barely made dent to your co2 emissions. But then every little bit does help.\n\nSo if you're not the sort of person to keep a new car for 6+ years, then it's only worth buying an electric car if you had to buy a new car anyway.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "hrthrhs"}

Also I do not see what climate change has to do with this discussion, but anyway just to give you another point of view that you seems so fond of: It is very clear that the climate changes, but not necessary from the CO2 level in the atmosphere. CO2 is a gas of life as without it we would not exist. Below 150 ppm, the plant-life will die off on a massive scale. and before the use of fossil fuel our vegetation was actually starving. The trees and plants benefits greatly from increased CO2 levels, animals and insects benefits from the increased vegetation and so do we. People \"feel\" that CO2 cause the climate change but nobody knows for sure. In all the other global warmings that they have been able to see from the Greenland ice cores, the CO2 level has lagged behind by about 800 years. What the Greenland ice cores also shows us is that we are long overdue a global cooling as the larger ice ages has gone in cycles of about 100.000 years with a brief warm peek that we are at the end of now. So most likely the planet will be unaccessible from global cooling rather than from global warming. We can only hope that the increased CO2 level will delay the global cooling for a few 1000 years more. I think our descendants will appreciate that.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "John Torset"}

In Australia where I live we have just had unprecedented wild fires (I am a volunteer fire fighter) as was also seen in California.

Ultimately as the technology for producing the electricity becomes more efficient it will become a better option, and the money going into battery research for Tesla is the main reason for their expensive cars. After about a generation we can expect a high number of electric cars because they'll just be a better, more affordable option. There's a lot more innovation to be had by using a battery instead of a combustion engine (because it takes up less space), for example stopping distance (lighter weight) and acceleration (you can directly attach power to each wheel).

The lifetime of the batteries is strictly connected to the usage ratio - the more you are going to use your car, the faster you will need to replace your batteries and as far as I know, new batteries for Toyota Prius cost 5500$.\n2. The second disadvantage of batteries is their dependence on temperature. The only temperature independence batteries are VERY expensive (almost 3 times more expensive than those in Tesla) and production process is so complicated there is no possibility to mass produce them.\n3. In your calculations, you forget to mention that electricity is not cheap. Production of electricity is expensive and transmission have very high losses. If everyone changes their gas cars to electric cars, in USA energy demand will increase up for >40%. Good luck California ;)\n\nSo if you take under consideration only car/battery production, how much CO2 is released to the atmosphere during gas car usage and you don't consider everything besides which has to be updated/changed/implemented - this has no sense.\n\nOk, let we get this straight. You producing an electric car. Jeeeej! And now you need to produce electric energy to fuel it. How do you do it? Hmm... SOLAR SYSTEM! Jeeeej! Free energy from the sun! Ok. So now you have to develop solar panels. Solar panels are creating electricity but... DC. So you need to... buy batteries! Why? Because converting DC to AC takes power and effort, you can't just compensate this with capacitors because if there will be a huge drain jump - you can destroy the entire system - why? IGBT drivers are VERY delicate and diodes can not only be broken with too high voltage - but also with too small voltage (there is no better DC-AC converter than IGBT). Ok, so now we have AC, what next? Now we have to transmit this electricity. How far? 50 miles - no problem. 100 miles? Shiet. You need to create a transformer to make a higher voltage to reduce losses and give ~200V AC at the output... 200V? Shiet, this means you need a second transformer, which will lower the too high voltage and stabilize it. What else do you need? Hmmm... At least 400 miles of cable (L1, L2, L3, N).\n\nHow much CO2 will take to produce a transformer? How much it will take to produce this cables? How much it will take to produce additional batteries and solar panels? The problem with electricity is physic - at this moment we just can't make it in an efficient way, that's why it is expensive.\n\nThe true fact is that the CO2 we will save when we resign from using gas engines will be spent on everything else with is required to develop electricity and maintain it. Besides, how much percentage of a CO2 production is made by vehicles? Hmm... 10%? Less?\n\nYou need to understand - electric cars is a totally new market (car market, electricity market, transmission market) and they will do and say anything to make new customers ;) People, normal people are customers. If cars are responsible for less than 10% CO2 production, why they don't lower CO2 production for what is responsible the 90% rest of \"something\"?

{"cid": "UgwwuGtcSGr6pNS3dGJ4AaABAg", "text": "Nice video, but if this is correct you really should offer further explanation because this claim contradicts basic physics, and in the end even if true it is misleading. \n\nEvery time energy is transferred  / converted (into the battery and out of the battery) you loose energy. So if the energy in electric cars came from burning gasoline to charge the batteries it would always be the case the that electric cars are worse for the environment. (In this video your environmental criteria are solely based on CO2 emissions, and that is another concern.)\n\nOn the other hand if the energy in the battery comes from energy sources that produce less CO2 than burning gasoline, the door opens for your claim to be correct. US electrical energy comes from (roughly) 30% coal, 30% natural gas, and 20% nuclear and 20 renewable.  Coal emits about twice as much CO2 as natural gas, but the two averaged together emit about the same amount as burning gasoline (per unit energy created). And we also have to consider electric cars loose about 20% of the energy used to charge the battery. So if it is true that using electric cars puts less CO2 in the air than using gasoline cars,  -it is because our nation is using natural gas, nuclear, and renewable to generate 70% if the nations electricity, and burning gasoline emits more CO2 than those energy sources. In short the electric car creates less emissions  from usage because electricity (on average and currently) comes from cleaner fuels (in terms only of CO2 emissions) than gas, and that  difference outweighs the losses associated with having to store energy in the batteries. \n\nThat leads to a less superficial understanding of this topic.  If the US ever starts using more coal (which is the one fuel America has a lot of still) this claim about electric cars will not be true. Also one ought to think about the how the 30% we get from natural gas has only happened in the last 20 years as the direct result of fracking technology, which introduces other environmental concerns. Also nuclear power is not free of environmental risks. \n\nIt should be clear that using a 3000lb electric car to move 1 person around is not significantly better for the environment than using a gasoline car. If we are serious about surviving ourselves we need to use less energy -in the context of transportation that means embracing efficient forms of mass transit, and we need to invest more heavily in renewable energy.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Jay Smathers"}

Most car batteries get recycled to tasks that require less current after 25 years. The only reason these batteries even have to be changed after 25 years is because they cannot put out large amounts of instantaneous current. The batteries dont just die, they just weaken so they cant be used for something that requires such a burst of current.

They'll often produce more nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide.  You're trading better economy and less carbon for a higher proportion of smog.\nTo say that they're \"worse for the environment\" would require a much more in-depth analysis.  I expect it's likely better overall, even if it's worse in some ways.\n\nAlso, don't forget that car's aren't the only EVs available.\nElectric bicycles and motorcycles have much better energy economy.  A 1kWh battery (1/30th the size of the leaf) on a bicycle will give more than enough range for most commutes.  The main limiter there is actually travel time.  Most people won't want to ride more than 40 minutes or so, which limits you to around 15-20km.

The other main stages for loss through heat occurs in otherwise obvious and similar locations for both vehicles (production of electricity vs fuel and efficiency of the actual ICE/EV in utilizing its energy source).

While the provided pie chart and graph for the EVs specifically notes that the emissions for EVs are based on emissions from their electricity sources (coal, solar, hydro, etc.),  Fenske just says \"emissions\" for gas cars. It seems to imply that the emission from fuel production is included, but when Fenske calculates the annual emissions from his truck, it doesn't hold up. He bases his calculation on the truck's own emissions but still manages to come up with a result comparable to the national one DOE provides.\n\nThat rambling finally leads me to my point... I think, in terms of argumentative structure, it's fair to compare the battery production + car production for an EV vs just car production of an ICE alone because he is considering it as a component of the car and not necessarily a \"fuel\" in the way electricity would be considered \"fuel\" for EVs. In that sense, it would be kind of weird to compare component production emissions to fuel transportation emissions (instead, it would make more sense to compare fuel transport to electricity transmission over wires, like you noted in your first comment). However, assuming the gas production/transportation isn't included in the DOE reports Fenske refers to for emissions, you're absolutely right in that he definitely missed a vital aspect of the EV vs ICE argument, and it would've given EVs a massive jump over ICEs.\n\nalso another key thing to consider with your point of increased use of renewable energy is development of more efficient technology for harnessing renewable energy, which again... will place EVs way ahead, like you say", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "hexaitine"}

Part of the regulation process includes solidifying and storing it in coal under earth's surface, effectively removing it from the atmospheric carbon cycle.

Yes, the photosynthesis requires CO2. However, it does not require all of the CO2 we are releasing, and the fact that we are cutting down trees left and right doesn't help that case. This means a bunch of excess CO2 just sits in the air. Also, CO2 is responsible for some of the warming. Other greenhouse gases and pollutants are notably more potent than CO2 (for instance, methane, or CH4). The issue is just that we release a ton of CO2 in particular so that's what's primarily messing up the atmospheric regulation (thereby making it a pollutant!).

However, it is important to keep in mind that humans cut down or burn large amounts of vegetation every day (to clear land or to use for resources other than biofuel). Biofuel is good when you're cutting vegetation to a limited extent. When you start cutting mass amounts, even the CO2 released by burning the biomass in biofuel can overburden the limited surviving vegetation. The system becomes unbalanced because there are too few carbon sinks to absorb all of the CO2 released. Biofuel largely works under the ideal assumption that you are replacing everything you cut down with new saplings/seeds and allowing enough time for sprouts to grow.\nThink about it like this: if you cut down every plant in the world and then burned it all as biofuel, where would the released CO2 go?

I have never see a  published paper ever address the cost of transportation and mining of pre-production materials and labor for all of these activities. Your point is moot.\n\nI also disagree that the cost of EV's will get cheaper than a gas car of a equivalent class because some how batteries will get cheaper. Batteries are cheap as it is already, these are not silicon chips which can get cheaper each year because we have yet to reach the theoretical limit of silicon manufacturing. Batteries manufacturing using Lithium however are already perfected, your not going to magically get cheaper batteries just because of wishful thinking. The reductions in Kwh for manufacturing of batteries were achieved due to increases in economy of scale in order to meet demand. Ever since then the reduction in cost from year over year has almost plateaued. You will need a breakthrough in energy storage density in batteries before batteries can ever compete with chemical energy storage systems.\n\nAlso EV's are no where less complex then a normal car as you would suggest. Yest the main drive train is less complex but electric cars have complexities in other areas that a normal car does not. IE the electrical system needs to be more complex on account of the battery pack and the cooling for said pack. You also need regenerative breaking added to the car etc etc. In fact if you account for each battery cell and all the components that goes into each battery pack, you have just as many if not more parts that a normal drive train.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "typen3k0"}

Second, your more powerful argument doesn't make sense either. Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles are electric cars. They still have a battery pack in them to store the electricity they produce, as the Fuel Cell generates a consistent amount of it. The nature of driving uses more or less electricity than a Fuel Cell produces at any given time. Example: Lets say a Fuel Cell produces 5kWh of electricity, if you are driving on level ground at a constant rate of speed my Fiat 500e uses about this much power to stay moving at 45mph. But, when I accelerate from a stand still I'm using upto 94kWh; but, at least 30 odd kWhs depending on how hard I accelerate. When coming to a stop I generate anywhere between 0kWh and 49kWh depending on my rate of velocity and the rate of deceleration. So, if I was generating 5kWh constant, I would be using more power generally than I was making.  So a Fuel Cell has to be large enough to produce and abundance of power over the average. Leading to waste. It may be only producing H2O; but, the efficiency is not there as in a Battery EV. It only uses what is uses and saves the rest for later. Now with the introduction of Ultra Capacitors the battery might be swapped or combined with in either one of these systems; but, the argument still applies, a Hydrogen Fuel Cell still needs to produce and excess of the average to keep power going. Then eventually you will run out and you will have to stop a fuel station and refuel. Might as well plug in when you get the chance.\n\nNow finally, there is the Hydrogen infrastructure argument. How much energy are using to produce the Hydrogen? That energy has to come from somewhere. The infrastructure has to be installed in most places still. I'm not saying that EV chargers don't need to be installed; but, we can at least offset them with Solar PV or Vertical Wind Generators at the same time. So far, we are just missing the mark, we are not doing all that we can. Big Oil and Big Auto want you to think that Hydrogen Fuel Cell is the better solution. So you can buy their more complex systems, and their version of energy. Electric grids all around the world are getting \"greener\" all the time and they will only get better in the future.\n\nKorea has a very well done Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicle in the Hyundai Nexo if you are truly interested; but, my argument still remains.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Andrew Saginario"}

Distribution of gasoline is through a diesel truck; distribution of electricity is trough a power cable that distributes all one's electrical needs to a home or business. So, the distribution of electricity is built one-time and re-used; the distribution of gasoline (diesel) is repeated. In this scenario, EVs are greener than ICEs. In fact, this factor, may eliminate consideration of the battery's production...just guessing. :-) An EV may be immediately greener no matter what state one buys their EV, even in coal-produced West Virginia. Again...just guessing! I still feel good about my EV and Hybrid purchases this year in Texas. I have seen >55 mpg on the Hybrid (Ioniq) and 75% fuel cost reduction on my EV (Nissan LEAF).

What would happen if every vehicle in a particular state ceased to be gasoline (or diesel) powered, and became electric instead? Now, instead of relying on imported gasoline to power every vehicle in your state, you need to produce the same amount of energy in the form of electricity. Will the hydro-electric states be able to supply that power? Will solar and wind be able to produce enough electricity to power millions of cars in NY state? Simply put, the amount of energy required to maintain our current level of transportation is readily achievable by burning naturally occurring hydrocarbons, but I doubt it would be maintainable by alternative energy sources. Plus, have any studies been done on the environmental impact of taking that amount of energy away from the water (and erosion) cycle? Or taking that amount of energy away from wind and the weather cycles? Solar energy isn't free: it robs the earth of insolation, which is required for plant growth and life in general.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "John M"}

A couple of things I would bring up, though, you can't simply ignore the end of life issues when millions of pounds of batteries need to be recycled.  Recycling processes for something like that are heavy on water and chemical use and energy consumption.  You talk about one lithium mine in a remote area, but there are others where pumping massive amounts of ground water into evaporation ponds is affecting water supply for nearby populations.  As all of the manufacturers push into more ev production more mines will need to be opened, and they own't all be in remote areas.  Currently there are thousands of acres of evaporation ponds, it isn't just pure clean water vapor coming off those chemical and element laden waters, are those emissions accounted for in the battery production?  (or any of the mining or lithium extraction emissions or just battery production itself?)  What is the environmental impact of pumping oil out of the ground, transporting it, transporting it again, refining into gasoline, transporting that, then putting it into a vehicle vs extraction of coal, transporting, burning, etc.. of course blended with the other sources of electricity (those solar panels aren't emissions free, they had to be produced and shipped as did the controllers, inverters, wiring, mounting, etc...).

All of these shenanigans lead to sub-optimal investment and temporarily inflate bubbles, that make people less prosperous than they otherwise would be. Invading other parts of the world that are rich in oil is a part of the same corruption. I wouldn't call it a subsidy though. That seems to be stretching the meaning of the word.\n\nI live in the UK. When I put petrol in my car, over 60% of the money I pay goes to the government in tax! Meanwhile, the government uses taxes to build chargers that are either heavily subsidised or free. We have bureaucracies, in both countries, that keep coming up with mutually defeating rules regarding safety, fuel efficiency, and emissions that significantly increase the complexity and running costs of IC-engined cars. Yet people keep buying them. Even though taxes subsidise the cost of EVs.\n\nMake no mistake about it, once people have had their arms twisted to all get EVs, all the subsidies will stop and the taxes that were formerly paid by IC-engined car owners will be heaped onto the shoulders of EV car owners. Then people will be less free, because of the reduced range; and impoverished, because of the greater cost! The car industry is slowly killing itself by going along with this.

Mining the materials will impact the environment. Production of all plastic components used will damage the environment, let alone drilling for oil to create the raw material for plastic. Production of metal in the car usually produces some kind of toxic slag which is then dumped.   My whole point is that the CO2 emissions is just a small factor when considering the total environmental impact for creating and running an electric car.  Now if every car was fully electric the energy demand would be too great and thus this means you would need more power stations to run all these cars.  It is well documented that the modern demands for electricity barely meets the needs of a nation. We do not live in a world where we have an energy surplus, we are always In deficit.   Now it doesn‚Äôt matter if you build coal, nuclear, solar, wind or hydroelectric etc to keep up with the energy demands required, each option will have a long term environmental impact of some sort.  Anyways I thought I would point out the bigger picture.  Electric doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs better for the environment, air quality sure but don‚Äôt be deceived in to thinking your helping  the environment if you buy one.   We live in a throw away society and therefore anything old is just thrown on the scrap heap, even though it may work fine.  I think a solution may be to look at how you could convert older cars into at least a hybrid.  I‚Äôm sure it would cost a pretty penny but if it cheap enough and has less impact on the environment vs creating a totally brand new car then that would be the better option.   But of course as a car manufacturer, you wouldn‚Äôt be interested in looking into retro fitting because 1. It costs money and 2. There is probably no profit in it and they want to sell all the cars they have sitting around.   So what is the solution to all this?

How would the figures look if you could calculate the cost of changing over technologies to service EVs, particularly building the infrastructure required in remote or expansive countries. In Australia, I sense there has been a reluctance, maybe fear to embrace EVs, from the power grid industry for a start, (who have not been supported or guided by successive Federal Governments), but also from the manufacturers who dropped their underwhelming early EV models on the market here at ridiculous prices. The first Mitsubishi MiEV and Nissan Leaf were priced around $A60K here in 2010.  Were they really serious? Hybrid Toyota Prius and Honda Civic have been a more affordable option for the average owner interested in E technology here for the last decade. Make sense of that (given the complexity of a hybrid)! The lack of infrastructure has also added to the 'range anxiety'. As renewable energy generation grows and the capacity and infrastructure to service large numbers of EVs becomes realistic, then the numbers will improve for EVs as you say.

Although you pointed out some true facts the main statement that electricity is the cleaner solution (or the opposite) is still debatable. You even pointed out in the video that the main statement depends on the location where you charge your vehicle which is directly coupled to the question: \"How is the electricity produced?\". This and nothing else was my point and this is why in my opinion the whole question is a bit silly in the first place. Maybe I should have pointed this out more clearly in my comment. Electricity should be really seen as some form of energy transportation method. In contrast, fossil energy sources are not only a form of transporting energy but also the source of the energy, too. One can even take fuel/diesel and burn it to produce electricity. Please do no think that I have problems with electric cars. I think they are the future. But when it comes to the environmental aspects, I would say: \"It depends...\".\n\nHowever, even if you use the statistical approach here in form of the mean values (which is by no means the only approach here by the way) the metric is a bit problematic here, too. CO2 emissions are not the only relevant environmental factor. As I pointed out, nuclear power plants lead to nuclear waste which will be problematic for hundreds of years so we basically damage our environment for generations. One thing that I find problematic about all those \"CO2 arguments\" (in fact argumenting with CO2 emission is almost always silly; although most people do so) is that by reducing CO2 emission we basically do not gain anything in the long run as we are not tackling the root of the problem which is the setting free of all the CO2 which is bound in fossil energy sources (incredible amounts of CO2 by the way). Once the CO2 of those fossil energy sources is set free it is very hard to get it out of the atmosphere. The right thing to do would be to stop setting free all the CO2 in the fossil energy sources which can be achieved by increasing taxes on those energy sources over time until it is not profitable in comparison to \"green energy\" any more.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Martin Martin"}

When the battery craps out in 8-10 years, 15 if you're lucky, there is the issue of recycling which takes more energy and byproduct, especially with lithium ion.  The challenge is making lithium ion battery recycling profitable or they'll just end up in landfills regardless of laws and regulations.  For example, no one within 100 miles from me recycles glass, plastic, or aluminum anymore because it's not profitable so it all ends up in the landfills.....  Not a bad video though however, I don't believe gas or battery powered cars are the answer unless battery technology improves further.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Mitsubeasty1"}

Thus, the CO2 emissions is dramatically less than gasoline or other sources of electricity generation. Having said all that, the other reason I bought my EV is the dramatic reduction in fuel costs. My residential electricity is 9 cents per kWh. Gasoline can't begin to compare to that. Even if you added gasoline taxes on top of electricity costs, electricity is still much cheaper. Unlike gasoline, my electricity plan locks in the price for the duration of the contract (one year, typically). No energy cost surprises. Lastly, even if all else was even, the driving experience of an electric is far superior to that of a gasoline car, especially in stop-n-go commutes, city driving. The electric motor has instant torque -- no waiting for a gas engine to rev and a transmission to shift gears. Superior.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "bsaxman2012"}

The EPA defines MPGe as the kWh equivalent to the energy in a gallon of gasoline.  This figure does not include any of the losses involved in producing the electricity, from power plant emissions/construction emissions, to power line losses and added construction needed, charging losses, costs due to charging time(I can get $100/hr consulting), or the energy costs/material costs required to support dilute, intermittent electricity from solar and wind.  Hydropower is just as reliable and readily available and controllable as fossil fuel generation, but much more localized in production  so the costs are likely in a range similar to fossil fuels.  There is an additional cost to electric cars in the time required for charging, and the costs associated with limited range, and the fact that currently electric cars are not charged for road usage through the fuel taxes and the costs of subsidies for wind and solar.\n\nIf you have a  fairly limited commute to work, and are able to \"stack\" most of your other driving into single trips an electric car probably makes some sense.  You do have to be dedicated to making it work which requires more of your time.\n\nI think for most people the most reliable, economic choice for a second, mainly commuting vehicle is a reliable hybrid  with no subsidies attached.

But, I agree in everything except for emissions for electricity production...\nEven if you live in Idaho, your power will not come primarily from hydro.\nHere's why:\nWhile providing electricity, hydro power and other renewables are always maxed out, because they are the cheapest. That means, that there is only a fixed ammount of renewable electricity. There is no way to provide additional water or additional sun, because there is none. The only powerplants which can and do deliver additional power to the grid are thermal power stations, gas, oil or coal, as they have a lot of storage.\n\nYou can also think of it like that: With increasing number of electric cars in Idaho, the hydro power will represent less and less in total electricity mix and the average emissions will be getting higher. And even if a whole state had a surplus of hydropower, less exports to other states would cause emissions there.\nUnfortunately, there's no free lunch :(", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Bo≈°tjan Zajec"}

Same for wind.  So... those are ALSO going to be used to the fullest capacity possible.  Which means that all EXTRA consumption is going to come from only 2 sources: Nuclear, and carbon-based fuels.  Carbon-based fuels are generally used last, because costs are roughly proportional to production levels.  Hydro-powered generators are never shut down, except to perform maintenance.  Gas-fired generators are shut down at the drop of a hat, due to nothing more than \"It's 4:05 pm in the rust-belt, so a lot of factories just shut down their machinery, and now we're pumping electrons that nobody wants\"\nTherefore, your carbon production analysis is completely ignoring the reality of the actual economy of electricity production and delivery.\n3: If huge numbers of people got rid of their gasoline driven vehicles, and started driving electrics, coal-fired and gas-fired electricity production would skyrocket, as now these idled carbon and hydrocarbon-fueled plants would still be needed to produce electricity during the night-hours when the heavy users (factories) are shut down... because now we have millions upon millions of cars plugged in sucking down electrons.\n4: None of  this matters anyways, as CO2  has a miniscule effect on temperatures and climate when compared to water vapor.

My point here is that sales of fuel efficient vehicles is not the result of regulation, but rather the result of the existence of fuel efficient cars that people really like. Also, to put a finer point on it: Correct or not, my personal definition of dereguation is not \"no\" regulations, just \"fewer\" or \"less draconian\" regulations. \n\nThe de-regulation of pot is the result of people really liking pot, which is the same phenomenon that deregulated alcohol. Regulations are fine, you can tax it and prevent the sale to minors, just don't throw an adult in prison for recreational use. \n\nTaxation occured before the IRS, as did police officers, etc. There are other ways to tax. Of course we need taxes. Of course there needs to be enforceable guidelines for the disposal of toxic waste. I'll even give on the very real possibility that some environmental regulation may inspire technologies that improve efficiency. But the primary driver is demand.

The core reason why fuel economy keeps going up is government regulation.  That is literally 99% of the reason.  Without forcing automakers to collectively improve fuel economy,  fuel economy would barely move over time.  You would never notice because all the other automakers would have equally crappy fuel economy, so there would be no better choices.\n\nThe same reason electric cars are here.  Without mandates and support, the development of those would have stalled completely, and Leaf would literally be the benchmark of what would be available today.\n\n\"But the primary driver is demand. In the end, if the consumer doesn't want it, or it isn't a matter of national security, the technology will never be developed. \"\n\nA lot of technology needs government nudging and funding to become reality.

Of course, practically anything can be argued to fall under the ubrella of national security, including the buying habits of consumers, so at this point we're reduced to our personal opinions on the matter.\n\nIn reality economies and the emergence of technology are very complex. Another person could jump in and say that the only thing that matters is advertizing and messaging/media, since that is the well from where all political will and economic activity springs. Another could say that women's rights and status in society is the primary driver of population, and the distribution thereof, therefore shaping the economic, environmental and political landscapes. \n\nThe perspectives are endless. It's interesting to look through any number of perspectives, but the lens that I usually settle on sees people behaving in their own interests, and always looking for a way for their surroundings to improve. This places a natural demand on producers to constantly refine and innovate. Looking back, it doesn't take much imagination to see how a person would prefer a gas or electric furnace over an open fire pit, or how the internal combustion engine is preferable to an external combustion engine. Reduced consumption, safety, health concerns, and convenience are all tied together in a nice package, so it just makes sense. \n\nSame with an electric car. Why would I buy a loud, heavy, maintenance intensive, smelly chunk of 150 year-old technology when I could get something that is (insert antonyms here). And yes, just plain environmental concerns factor into this, because people do (to one degree or another) see their surroundings as a vital interest. Some people include far away places in this calculation, while others don't even wash their hands, but very few people want more pollution just for the sake of it. \n\nBut, to address your point a bit: The government is in fact an invention of popular demand, and seeks to manifest the will of the general population as a matter of principle. It is highly effective when it comes to some endeavors, particularly when the mandate is well defined (Manhattan Project), and where huge strategic gains accrue (GPS, cryptology, etc.). Improvements in electric vehicles is a long game, however, and the collapse of western civilization is not imminent. I see plenty of smart people with plenty of money in the private sector racing for the next best electric car. I can see maybe a few federal education grants in support of the cause, but there are other priorities for federal dollars right now.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Crawpunk"}

If you start requiring for more power to charge a massive amount of cars, suddenly the demand increases and might be met with coal power plants.\n\nThe same goes with battery production as was assumed in the video. If the demand is massively increased, producing lithium (and other elements) could cause much more of an issue. The same way, getting oil wasn't as bad for the environment when the demand was much lower, but due to it massively increasing, oil sands or offshore platforms are much more common.\n\nBut with many more batteries, recycling would make much more sense too, which would offset some of the mining and so on.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "ivanlagrossemoule"}

Producing lithium batteries should never require coal here, if we support the right type of growth. Also, if you are concerned about mining and its impacts, you should consider the amounts involved. A typical coal train has about 130 to 150 cars. All lithium mined in the world in a year would equal about three coal trains in weight. That's between 360 to 450 cars of coal. That, and the fact that lithium is a salt that dissolves in water, it is in sea water, and could be filtered from our oceans, means that mining might not even be needed in the first place.

Same for almost all value chain or machinery used for production. \n\n3rd - The impact on maintenance in adding to emissions or carbon can accumulate through time and can be added to the equation. Disposing, recycling of oils, etc also adds to pollution. With electric, there is no need for voluminous oil changes, the use of filters, belts, cogs, gears, etc., etc. Probably the oil differential is the oil, and maybe some grease for the axle or joints, and some lubrication for some parts. And maybe only air filter is necessary for changes. This does not just lower cost of maintenance, but it also lower the carbon footprint of the vehicle. \n\n4th - electric vehicles is and will usually be attached to solar or wind power generation, maybe more so with solar. In the long run, as battery price goes down, and solar panels become cheaper, these vehicles will be charged by the car owners themselves. \n\n5th - Expect to see new battery tech or breakthroughs where we will see solid state batteries that can be charged in just 10-15 min vs 30-60 min. They will be higher density or capacity, requiring less volume, materials for the same capacity. They will also last longer as they will last longer (5,000-10,000+) charge cycles thus having no more need to change batteries in fact even past 8 years. Also, the weakness of current batt tech his the electrolyte. They break down eventually. If they go solid or some other tech, there is no need for this limitation and most likely recycling will be easier, faster, and cheaper. \n\nAs we are still new and the revolution is ongoing, expect to see how electric vehicles will still move to a lower carbon footprint as other value chain and tech innovations eliminates those present negatives.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Mel Enriquez"}

Thus, you are presuming CO2 production is bad for the environment.  I would encourage you to do a deep dive into answering this question.  Every breath you take is creating CO2.  Plants live off CO2.  If you choose to take time to do an honest assessment of this question, I would like to hear your answer.   Secondly, how much of an impact is \"man made\" CO2?   Additionally, as you discussed the alternative energy sources are going to expand, I encourage you to read reports generated by Germany.  They have gone fairly hardcore into wind and solar since the early 1990's.  The basic problem is that there is very limited storage on the AC grid.   Translated, that means that when society wants to consume more or less energy on a hourly basis, it does.  Even on days when the sun does not shine and there is no wind.  The end result is that if you were to try to get above about 15% wind and solar the energy production in the system (grid), the energy companies have to ramp up and down fossil fuel electric plants.  This results in those plants being less efficient from a CO2 point of view.  Also there is a problem that where it is always windy, and always sunny, do not necessarily correlate where the people live.  Thus you have to run more electric transmission lines.

(Then there's no leaving for a lunch break as that interrupts the charge, and adds more time to the recharge time too.) These are all considerations as well just on the ability to get around without your vehicle becoming a ball and chain tethered to you.\n\nNow for the repairs. Most modern gas vehicles are reliable for the most part, and offer good service for most of the life of the vehicle (providing the maintenance is kept up) before the vehicle needs any major repairs such as any drive train components such as an engine, transmission, or rear axle (rear wheel drive) replacements. \n\nThe EV on the other hand, has the electric motor, the battery pack, and the electronics which are far more expensive than the gas engine electronics in the event of a failure which would offset the cost of a new or used engine or transmission in a gas engine. This doesn't include the fact that very few places are available where a technician would be qualified to repair the EV, forcing the owner of the EV to pay a premium rate to repair it.\n\nI like EV technology, as it's certainly came a long ways, but it's still got a long way to go until it's practical for anything but some \"feel good\" vehicle for some virtue signaling snowflake who lives only a couple of miles from college, and recharges their vehicle on mom's dime while they play video games in her basement.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Perry Bailey"}

Things to look at would be acid mine drainage , leachates, and tails ponds common in hard rock and most other mining operations.  Does the host country remediate and clean up after mine closers or leave the mess behind.  Also any mining tends to be a very carbon intensive process requiring large equipment that tends to run on diesel.  2) of lesser concern is the end of life battery.  In NA at least we are getting better about battery recycling, but in much of the world batteries end up in the land fill.  The acid and heavy metals in batteries can be very damaging to the environment especially in poorly designed land fills.  \n\nFor myself I live in a cold climate where we can have problems with our batteries on regular vehicles.

As you surely know, energy is neither created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another. Incoming solar radiation that we \"rob\" with solar panels would have wound up as low grade heat dispersed in the environment and gradually leaked out into space if we didn't take it. Actually, the same thing happens when we do take it; converting solar energy to electric energy. We use the electric energy and it ultimately arrives as low grade heat dispersed in the environment. No amount of energy was lost at all, we just borrowed it for awhile.\nOf course, this doesn't take into account environmental degradation due to mining and processing ores, manufacturing, transportation, etc. to get the solar panels and batteries, etc. online. Looking at the other renewables come up with similar results, no loss of energy in the system, but some, and sometimes considerable, environmental degradation.\nHowever, compared to the cost of the alternative fossil fuels, both direct costs and external costs, and which are not renewable on a human time scale, the so-called renewable energy sources are far better in many applications.\nI think you misunderstand or misunderstood the notion of renewable resources. It is that the resource can be tapped in an ongoing way without depleting the supply. This says nothing about the demand side of the equation. For example you can cut trees from a forested 100 acre plot, plant tree seedlings,  let them grow for 80 years or so, cut them out again and repeat the process over and over again. In this case, we get to use the wood produced from that plot over and over again. This does not mean there in an unlimited supply of trees. Likewise, the sun is considered a renewable resource because it is going to keep sending our planet roughly the same amount of energy each year for the foreseeable future, and millions of years beyond that.\nI think you're generally on the right track, I just wanted to help clarify a bit.

Letting the pack that low is pretty rare,  many EV drivers would never have experienced it at all. In close to 300,000km of EV driving I've only hit turtle mode on an EV twice, one time was deliberate (I was seeing how the vehicle reacted to a low state of charge circling a charger) and once was within 100 meters of the DC rapid charger that was my destination.\nAlso a lot of the pack and cell design is fairly conservative, one of the reasons Nissan picked LMO for the Leaf was the stability of that chemistry.

Many creatures live in the desert, and when the companies that go for the lithium in the salts, the salts are spread over a large area, which THEN makes that area of the desert unlivable. When the lithium miners are done with one area, they simply move to the area next door and do it again. Plus, has there been studies to find out what the limits of lithium are in the world? How plentiful and to what extents are needed to supply billions of cars with batteries?\n\nAlso, if the idea pops up that we can charge our car batteries with solar cells, then there is the added pollution of making silicon and doping it into solar panels that make electricity. This is another fallacy that should not be considered as a 'renewable source'. Solar is not all that reliable, with the need to keep the panels pointed at the sun, most homes have stationary systems. Also, what about night time and days with little sun? The panels are not flawless and can break and the panels themselves do not last forever. Not to mention that the very best solar panel technology, which started out in the very low efficiencies way back in the '50s and now only has progressed to about 35% efficiency for the very best panels today. Again, multiply the current number of systems by 100s of millions and we have disastrous eco effects.\n\nThen there is wind power. The huge amount of concrete used to anchor each one of these windmill generators emits a tremendous amount of CO2 into the atmosphere while curing. Along with the very high costs and costs to the environment of producing all of the other materials needed for windmills make them marginal ecosystem wise.

{"cid": "UgyW38H9wkQhU4-q9LF4AaABAg", "text": "So, just out of interest, I plugged in the numbers from my car/driving style and found some interesting results.\nThe numbers are: CO2 emissions are 118g/km (compared to approx. 270g/km for the average mentioned in the video) and distance 15000km. To give the benefit of the doubt to the electric car (for a change) I reduced the yearly emissions to just 1 metric tonne per year (i.e. half of the original value). For these values, the time till ICE and EV are even is 6.5 years in total Co2 emissions. This is considering the small EV. For the extra powerful EV the time is 19.5 years! That is a long time. And what if I drove just 10 thousands kilometers a year? The time will rise to 27.8 years for the small EV and 83.3 years for the large EV! That is a really long time waiting for the return with several replacements of the battery and maybe even rewind of the electric motor (and complete car replacement for the large EV).\nBut let's be as generous to the electric cars as EE was to ICE. Let's explore the other extremes. Start with 20 and 30 thousand kilometers per year. That would result in 3.7 (20k) and almost 2 (30k) years for the small EV and 11 (20k) and 5.9 (30k) years for the large EV. This seems more reasonable. Oh wait, I forgot to factor in the fact that the EV is now doing greater distance, so back to 2 tonnes of C02 per year. Now we get 13.9, 3.2, 41.7, 9.7 years for the respective conditions. This does not look good, so let's go full \"EV preference mode\" and make the EV produce only 15% more emissions during production (the lowest estimate mentioned in the video). So:\nSmallest EV 10k (1 tonne/yr): 8.3 years\nSmallest EV 15k (1 tonne/yr):  1.9 years\nSmallest EV 20k (2 tonnes/yr): 4.2 years\nSmallest EV 30k (2 tonnes/yr): 0.97\n\nCouple of notes, before conclusion: I might have made some errors and I sort of randomly rounded the values to single decimal digit. For that I really do apologize. If there are some errors, please correct me and I will edit that. Overall, this is a lazy comparison. The more proper way would be to factor in alternative running costs (oil, filter,...) and have a linear emissions for the EV (i.e. not 1 OR 2 tonnes) and larger yearly emissions for the large EV. This is just a quick calculation to give a general idea of the situation. Please, take the numbers as very rough ballpark estimates.\n\nSo, the conclusion. It is not that EVs are bad and my intention was not to in any way invalidate the numbers presented by EE. I just felt like there is a part of the picture missing. The missing part is that it's not black and white situation (nothing in real life is) whether EVs are more ecological than ICEs. It really depends on what you drive and how much you drive. If you commute daily, then you are gonna see faster return if you switch to EV. And therefore it makes sense to switch to EV. But it is really important to also say that if you are only using your car occasionally and it is a rather frugal ICE car then switching to EV will hurt the environment more.\nIt is also important to keep the facts straight and to give the whole picture to keep the research, the manufacturers, and the energy industry awake. If we say that EVs are good as they are and it is not the complete truth, they might get content with that and slow down the progress (it costs hyper massive amounts of money, so everyone will be really glad to slow down). We need to keep pointing at the shortcomings of EVs not as an excuse to drive ICE with a massive inefficient engine but to make the EVs even more ecological.\n\nAlso, think about how fast would both the ICE and EV boats sink if we considered commuting by bicycle/e-bike...", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Sy Iridium"}

You post a comment and than you can watch how the minds of humans work for free.\nAnyway, I never used the word pollution, just emission. And it is not me, who is concerned with CO2. This was just a supplementary material to the video that was concerned with CO2 emissions. Obviously, you can go much deeper and concern yourself with more stuff, like NOx, PM, disruption of the landscape, etc. I would like to have the time to go through all that calculations. Unfortunately, I am not a full time YouTuber, so I have to do an actual work which leaves me less time to go through all those calculations. Maybe in the future. But regardless of that, even if someone did all that, it would still give just a very broad picture. In the real world, it is simply impossible to account for everything and to be really thorough, you should do it on an individual basis.\nThat was one of my points. The video was about the question: \"Should we make USA electric?\" (the answer, concluded in the video based on some solid evidence, was yes). I wanted to point out that while this is true on the large scale, on individual scale (and in other countries), you should be more cautious and do some personalized calculations before you make a decision.\n\nTo simplify, if you drive a large 20yr old pickup truck with a 4liter V8 and you spent 95% of the time driving to work, doing 20k kilometers a year, then it makes absolute sense to switch to EV. If you drive a small economical modern car with lot of tech to make it less harmful to the environment and you drive only occasionally then switching to EV (right away) will cause more harm then keeping the ICE car. But these were just the extremes and it is a little bit more complex for anything in between.\n\nFor that reason, it is sort of dangerous to just use the average values. If you are asking whether the overall trend should be more electric cars, then it will give you some roughly correct idea (just keep in mind that you want to use median, not mean, otherwise the values will be offset by some 30+yr old trucks that convert 99% of fuel into pollution and only 1% to actual movement). But it won't give you correct answer of the complete picture.\n\nI hope you all can understand what I am trying to say. I don't think it is that complex but maybe I am not explaining myself clearly enough. I am not trying to argue for electric cars. Mostly, because there is nothing to argue about. They are simply the future and personal preference does not matter (but if anyone is interested, I really like ICE cars, especially small European hot hatches; they are awesome and I am slightly sad that they are not in our future). The questions is, what is the current state (i.e. how soon will the \"future\" come) and should we try to switch to them as fast as possible? That is quite complex to answer and my point was to show that it is not that simple.\n\nBack to the CO2 as a \"pollutant\". That is also a difficult topic. Basically, some of the things that come out of the car are not 100% bad, like CO2, NO2, H2O. That is why the name emissions is preferred. However, they become a problem when they are emitted in large quantities into the environment. If you don't think CO2 is a problem, try breathing in 100% CO2 gas for a few minutes. And that is before we get to the greenhouse effect, which is implicitly defined as a main point when mentioning CO2 emissions.\nThat's also the reason why breathing or having a furry companion in your house is not viewed as a major contributor to climate change. It is not about the chemical compound itself, it is about the quantity. That is also why we can have a debate whether to switch to EV or keep your ICE car. Both cause emission of CO2 (and yes, also other stuff) but the variable is the quantity in both cases.\n\nLastly, the topic of e-bikes...argh.\nI really \"like\" how when someone mentions a bicycle, everyone start mentioning their grandma, people with disabilities and epic journeys to the arctic as an excuse not to ride ~5km to their work everyday in a moderate climate. Major part of the commuting people are able-bodied adults within the 20-45yr range. And it is no problem to ride during rain or snow - my 60+yr old mother rides everyday to work almost the whole year whether it rains or snows; and so does for example a major part of Scandinavia, so this excuse is completely invalid. You just have to work for it a little bit (like have knobby tires and a proper jacket). Yes, it is not as simple as lugging around a massive, unnecessary lump of metal. But you cannot say you are trying to save the environment if you are not willing to work for it EVEN IF you are driving an electric car (that is like when people buy loads of unnecessary stuff with \"ECO\" stickers on them and feel like they are helping \"The Planet\"; million times small harm = big harm). Because the electric car, as was shown in the video, is still responsible for some major contributions to the emissions of CO2. And yes, the bike is too; again, it is about the quantity which is much smaller for the bike.\nAnd I mentioned the e-bikes, because many people have to cover distances larger than 10km and many don't have showers at work. It is still doable but the group of people who can comfortably do it is much smaller. But the advent of e-bikes enabled large masses of people to reduce their \"carbon footprint\" by great amount. It is now up to them whether they will choose to do it or not.\n\nAnd the arguments about menace on the road. That is a topic on its own and I don't want to get into it here. But a quick reality check: everyone on the road is a menace and the biggest killing potential is still in the hands of irresponsible and incapable drivers who don't \"expect\" other participants to appear. If people would be considerate enough of each other there would be no dispute and less deaths on the roads. And it is not about the \"cyclists\" it is about the people. An asshat on a bike will be and asshat in a car and is an asshat in real life, that's a fact. But this is actually irrelevant for this discussion (I leave it to the reader to deduce why).\n\nAnd I really don't get the argument about not being able to carry more than a grocery bag. How much stuff you need to carry with you when you commute to work everyday? And you cannot fit more than a grocery bag worth of cargo in the Leaf anyways, so...", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Sy Iridium"}

If we continue at the present rate of global warming we are going to be involved in sixth mass extinction of species on the planet Earth.\n\nNow part of that is due tohuman activity related to increasing human population, such as converting forests to monoculture croplands, and the fragmenting of populations leading to reproductively isolated groups that are no longer viable, as in they die out. So this does not separate the two out, but adding increasing amounts of greenhouse gases will definitely worsen the impact of these other human activities, increasing the rate of extinction of the numbers of animals and plants already threatened by other human activities. This does not even address the number of organisms directly wiped out global warming.\n\nYour comment about the Earth being better off with increasing numbers of plants due to increased quantities of CO2 is absurd. First, you will have much smaller land masses, so you will have fewer land species. Plus the acidifying of oceans will result in the elimination of large numbers of coral reefs, which are some of the most bio diverse and productive environments in the ocean.\n\nAn added problem that is likely, though the science is still out on that due to the complexity, is that ocean currents and air circulation between climate zones may be largely shut down, resulting in hugely narrowed temperate climate areas. That is going to be a huge problem for people. \n\nCoupled with the widespread disruption of modern mass production food crops while population is increasing, this will result in large-scale starvation. While that is not directly mentioned in your response, forgive me if I am biased but I would like my children and grandchildren not to have the face problems like that. For the record, starvation on that scale leads to warfare, and we have already had places where the partial collapse of farming due to drought helped trigger warfare where other issues were in place, like Syria. The problem is that in marginal regions like that, it is very hard to sort out whether the drought would have happened without global warming, or if it was part of the natural cycle in arid areas that would have happened regardless.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Shawn Carroll"}

Exhaust and leakage components to the atmosphere (NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4...) are different between gasoline and coal.  Also, CO2 is just one of a host of different greenhouse gases.  (The video skipped the rationale for focusing only on the carbon emissions, but it's an informative, if incomplete perspective.)  The U.S. grid is approximately 30% coal-powered in 2018, so our iPhones, Teslas, and server farms are, also, fractionally coal-powered.  Crudely put, if they emitted the same amount of carbon, would you prefer a coal-powered car or a gas-powered car?  Coal's contribution AS A PERCENTAGE of the U.S. electric grid is, indeed, slowly falling over time, but since our demand for electricity is meanwhile zooming upward, our burning of coal is INCREASING.  We burn greater amounts of coal annually as time goes by, and that's mostly to drive the Tech Sector, including all its computers, networks, and phones.  (Surprise, coal fans.)\n\nThere was also no mention of one really huge factor making gasoline a desirable fuel: it has a very high energy-per-unit-mass value, especially in comparison to batteries, and gasoline is easily transportable at a tiny fraction of the cost of the energy it contains.  It's not a direct comparison, but electric transmission lines suffer significant losses simply due to heating up the wires as we try to send electric power to the end user.  As you point out, Adam, it's a whole new pile of data once we start to study the construction and operation of the fossil fuel infrastructure that brings our gasoline and try to compare that to the infrastructure detriments to the environment inherent in electric power generation, especially for coal mining.  Shall we consider health care costs, as well?  Lung cancer deaths-per-thousand-people, anybody?\n\nMy point:  The video is a sketch, a sort of back-of-the-envelope comparison between gas and electric cars, but the actual study of such things involves vastly more complexity than is presented here.

The casting process of the block and the head and cylinders and rods and so on sure is bound to consume many more resources than a little tin cover and some copper wires.\n\n2- extracting the minerals to manufacture the batteries is not good, but extracting oil must be much worse, and the millions of gallons spilled over a few decades is not taken under consideration for all the pollution that means for the environment. Also extraction, transportation, refinement, storage, transportation, transportation again and storage of fossil fuels MUST produce a ton of CO2. Just the energy needed for an oil tanker to pump in millions of gallons, transport them and pump them out.... that I‚Äôm sure pollutes a lot.\n\n3- The fact that the USA refuse to fully behave like a developed country and wants to behave like a third world country, should not be a factor for how much an electric car pollutes. The vast majority of energy supplied in Norway and Switzerland is from renewable sources, so the co2 emissions over the live of an electric car would take much less time to be less than that of an ICE even for a big P100D if the production of energy is clean the use of electric cars is clean.\n\nThank you Jason, as always your explanation was great and entertaining... just this time the field is too broad and way too many variants to consider", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "mtt38"}

So if one has access to natural gas and gas based electricity production, those production units will be maximized as much as practicable. The same could be said for coal states where the infrastructure and production capacity is lowest cost for coal. Both of these conditions imply that the last kW of electricity will be both expensive and likely to be more CO2 producing => fuel oil or crude oil. So buying an electric car would still incrementally consume high CO2 based kW.

All newly started companies that feature new technology and production lines are very investment-heavy from the start-up. Especially so when they are competing against an industry that has had more than 100 years to grow and settle in, like the oil- and ICE-industry has. This is also the time perspective one needs to consider when critizing Tesla for taking too long to make a payout to its shareholders. It takes time to build a car company. Tesla has technically earned money already, but everything gets invested back into the company for growth and investment, in areas like R&D and production, so nothing gets paid out. Until pretty soon now it seems. \n\nElectric vehicle sales doesn't necessarily plummet without subsidies, Tesla is selling more cars than both BMW and Mercedes in the US nowadays, thanks to TM3, and subsidies (tax credits) are now already reduced for Tesla due to hitting the 200,000 unit selling point this 3rd quarter of 2018. As far as I could gather from a quick search. \n\nWho says gasoline and heating oil isn't subsidized? It is! According to Wikipedia, a 2017 study by researchers at Stockholm Environment Institute published in the journal Nature Energy estimated that nearly half of U.S. oil production would be unprofitable without subsidies. \n\nEV-owners are exempt some taxes due to politicians trying to ease and accelerate the change to a better and more effective transport solution. Many are skeptical to adopting new technologies (like yourself) and without a little help from the governments around the world, a change would probably take 100 years or more.

No, it's not another problem if they have already solved that issue by a popular term EV user know, which is preconditioning. The vehicle doesn't always necessarily require power from the battery to heat it up. if plugged in and scheduled correctly, it'll transfer the residual heat energy from charging the battery to the cabin. It will also have warmed up the battery enough to reduced the impact from the cold weather. If the energy comes from a renewable source, no energy is wasted in this process. This process also mitigates range loss from a cold start.\n\nA internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle does this all alone (inefficiently) using the vastly wasted heat energy from the engine, and stand alone. No range loss is mitigated, there is no assisted power, and this is in addition of it being an overall inefficient process.

Look I don‚Äôr want to get into a flame war but equating carbon emissions with more environmentally ‚Äúgreen‚Äù prom myself with a background in economics, he doesn‚Äôt entirely get it.  I really don‚Äôt feel like writing an article based on legitimate skurced academic materials here but for now it is a wash overall globally more or less.  When you  factor in price and more people using electric cArs like if all cars were electric you aren‚Äôt doing much better fir the environment as a whole especially if all card out of billions were electric.  Things get trickier, and in the near to mid future to say be able to have those billions of electric cars and I have nothing against them,  Lithium mining and battery recycling actually becomes a very serious  environmental issue.  I think people can sometimes be naive and confuse lower greenhouse gas emissions with environmentalism.  Global Climate change is not something to be taken lightly.  But Price wise in terms of cost tradeoffs vs environmental damage.  Say all cars in America are electric.  That really negates some of his arguemens as to what state etc... Really there is just no way without nuclear fusion or much mire advanced fission reactors despite the  much more efficient electric cars that don‚Äôt just wast most of their energy as heat vs intenal combustion engines  really at any price other than extreme austerity and cut backs no one will agree to in living standards and overall globally for quite some time if anytime in the next 150 years solar energy or hydro electric would be able to produce enough energy considering developed countries at  large are using much more energy and energy intensive technology.  And obviously this guy can‚Äôt seriously be much of an environmentalist if he thinks only global and man made climate change which Is a problem are ‚Äúthe environment.\n\nAnd all the money wasted developing for the time stop gap renewable energy sources that  are very expensive and rather inefficient and on a much larger scale than they can already support id going  to work.  Fossil fuels aren‚Äôt better by any means.  But it just really isn‚Äôt something doable.  Maybe with a lot more much safer efficient nuclear energy, which has it‚Äôs own set of concerns obviously and will take a good number of decades to build up fir enough green energy.  But it will be more ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly in in terms of emissions as expensive as it may be it‚Äôs actually relatively cheap and not actually hiw most people imagine it.  On the downside, there are still some issues with the much more advanced   And renewable types of fission reactors that can be built and it is much more actually renewable than solar energy per cost and probably more environmentally friendly.  Basically the amount of clean power you can get from modern and newer 95% and increasing fuel cycle recycling is just ridiculously cheap compared to the not well intentioned but delusional thinking of green energy snd it‚Äôs limits on a global scale.  Mainly nuclear waste and nuclear energy not being renwed through fuel cycle now is do to lack of funding, politics.Radaphobia  .  And bans or heavy constraints placed on relatively simple research and just proving which had been kinda banned or made very difficult.\n\nAll I am trying to say is I‚Äôm not particularly a nuclear fission reactor advicate.  Just in terms of trade offs the push for ‚Äúgreen renewable‚Äù energy such as solar at this point is likely to yield more carbon and greenhouse gas output wheras the money and resources would be much better spent just getting next generation nuclear reactors on line which isn‚Äôt cheap.  The main issue is basically there just aren‚Äôt places anywhere for actual highly renewable more than solar going forward to be able to complete fuel cycle recycling.  We know how.  France has done well with very antiquated nuclear technology and has a veey high recycle rate on used fuel,,, not in practice. It id set up so that can happen.  But due to sandbagging such facilities to actually do it anywhere in the world don‚Äôt exist because the money is certainly there to have this.  Much safer than any current reactors of any kind.  But no one will allow that to be built....\nI don‚Äôt like it.  I‚Äôm not a nuclear fan boy.  Disasters will probably still happen ocasionally.  Just the alternative is still more costly and environmentally damaging and as far as fossil fuels in sensitive delicate areas, big problem.  But if you are really worried about carbon emmissilons, and rainforests,  there are few things worde than billions of people using wood fires and forest clearing bc they aren‚Äôt gonna have a chance ar much much higher priced less efficient solar or geothermal energy for the cost where that is a viable option and guess what they want to live and they live on subsistence farming etc... growing in population and also must clear larger and larger areas of forest to live a poor life because the naive things certai. Peope are pushing,  sure they work fine on limited scales in the right places, say iceland.  Not so much in much in say Subsaharan Africa.   Unless you propose we kill all these people or force them to be very much poor and have now energy to develop more efficient and environmentally friendly structures... Well,  might as well get ready for climate change to get worse because simply a lot of sincere ideas won‚Äôt be effective....", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "TheGrindcorps"}

The only elements lighter or more common in the universe, metal or otherwise, are hydrogen and helium.\n\nThere is very little of those metals in a battery too, as he explained in the video. And what is in them is largely recyclable already today, and will become more recyclable as there are more batteries produced and used and worn down over time. These are things that are all but impossible with fossil fuels like coal or oil etc.\n\nFurthermore, you said it yourself in your own comment that gasoline and other fossil and nonrenewable fuels are COMBUSTED and burned up. Batteries aren't combusted or consumed when you use them, they stay 100% right there in the car. Batteries are not fuel. Batteries are fuel TANKS, and electricity is the fuel.\n\nAnd batteries don't die either. They lose usable capacity. But they don't lose actual capacity, they just can't make use of their full capacity after a while due to microscopic changes that occur in their internal structure due to the way they operate to charge and discharge. When you recycle them, you're essentially breaking them up into their original elements and making them into a new battery with their original structure, and thus their original capacity again. It's a bit like cleaning accumulated sludge out of your gas tank so it'll hold its full original capacity again. The gas tank isn't lost in the process, so it's never sitting around in a landfill. And even if it were, those \"heavy metals\" as you incorrectly call them were already in the ground to begin with, that's where we got them. But since we never burned anything up, the lithium we took out of the ground is the same lithium we'd be putting back into the ground.

Australia and South America (ie. the ‚Äúlithium triangle‚Äù of Argentina, Chile and Bolivia) provide 80 to 90 percent of lithium production. In 2016, lithium production grew by 16 percent over the previous year. Australia produced most of it, 14,300 metric tons, much of which is shipped to China for processing. Here the Lithium Ion battery cells are made, which are put back on ships and sent to wherever the cars are made, which are again shipped to the point of sale.\n\nYou also glossed over the amount of water required for the process and dismissed it as being in arid areas where nothing survives. Indigenous people in the lithium triangle worry that the high levels of water needed to produce lithium -- as much as half a million gallons per ton -- may cut into the already limited water supply in the arid and drought-ridden areas where brine sites are located. These concerns have triggered protests against the exploitation of the resources by large companies. In 2012, 33 indigenous communities took calls for consultation about lithium development to Argentina's Supreme Court.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Christopher Yates"}

Doing the math on my own home country, using an average of 1.6 cars per household doing an average 15,000 miles per year, will multiply the average household usage by a factor 4 to 5. From the numbers you showed, wind and solar are hardly any factor at all (and obviously solar will never be when you want to charge the car overnight) and it will prove extremely hard to expand other green methods as most of these are in fact already used in full. Leaving nuclear, which to many-many-many-many people is no option at all.\n\nThe problem with this whole going to electric idea is that electricity is not an energy source. It is an energy transport, so it has to be produced somehow and you can't actually store it - not loss-free anyway and in Scotland they found that the most economic way to store it was to convert it to kinetic, pumping up water to a high basin and release it when the extra power is required. As such there is no point in doing a state to state comparison, because the only way to meet the additional demand from more EVs is by burning more fossil fuels.

A combustion vehicles fuel consumption suffers in heavy traffic while an EV's energy consumption improves (consumption scales directly with speed and whenever you are not moving the motor is off). There's also the misunderstanding about the scale of power consumption of auxiliary devices like lights & wipers vs the drive motor... a difference that often exceeds 1000 fold. Even the shortest range EVs could sit there with high beams on for weeks continuously before running the high voltage battery low.\n\n\nMy 2015 BMW i3 (my 3rd EV of 4) has 180,000km on the odometer, has only had one brake fluid change (and a wing mirror folding motor) as it's only maintenance (Jan 2017, as per the BMW schedule, 2nd service Jan 2019). The 2018 i3 has double that range from the same size and weight pack (44kWh). Since heating the same cabin is the same load (usually in -5C weather 0.5 kWh per hour, much less in warmer conditions) when battery capacity increases, cabin aircon/heating uses a lower proportion of the power consumption.\n\n\nI've saved ‚Ç¨25,000 in running costs vs a comparable vehicle and sit in traffic every day wondering why people around me haven't switched. The only answers I've been able to reach are 1. they don't know the advantages of EV 2. they can't afford the initial price of the car (though with tax incentives a 40kWh EV is the same price as a typical car in my country) 3. a minority can't charge at home or have another niche problem (90% of the people on my commute would have a driveway to charge in).\n\n\nEV drivers have generally owned combustion vehicles in the past and can directly compare from experience, very few combustion drivers have any experience whatsoever of EVs and getting over their preconceptions are the biggest hurdle.

With some exceptions (that can be solved in time) like housing with on-street parking, large families needing a cheap 6¬± seater and salesmen doing specific types of intercity driving, I'm very confident that the vast majority of people could switch to EV in the morning.

In my case the incentives on my i3 didn't even cover 50% of the sales and registration taxes. And for those of us in countries that import 100% of liquid fuels, produce most of our electricity from cheap renewables and have to pay tax money for CO2 emissions trading credits it's only fair that those causing less of a drain on government finances get some kind of incentive.\n\n2) The infrastructure is pretty cheap, we have this thing called an electrical grid that goes pretty much everywhere, even in a future where all vehicles are EVs because of the impact of home charging (which covers daily use for the vast majority of owners) you actually need only a small fraction of the infrastructure combustion vehicles, largely just rapid chargers at motorway services. And that infrastructure is getting to commercial viability on it's own in countries like norway and the netherlands without any tax break or incentive.. but for low EV penetration markets someone needs to subsidise the initial infrastructure, that can be carmakers (Ionity, Tesla and Electrify America are examples of this), investors not expecting returns for an extended period (FastNed is an example of this) or government.\n\n\n3) The hit to range is ~20-25% in -15C for the average EV (the average EV has a temp-controlled pack)... a combustion vehicle on average loses 15-20% of it's range in the same conditions. It's not a big issue, especially since the average EV is leaving home every single day with a full battery and we're a bit short of elves magically brimming combustion vehicle tanks in the night.\n\nI don't know where you are getting the idea that EVs are \"a more poorly performing vehicle\" the reality is quite the opposite. EV torque is very useful in daily driving,  charging at home is much more convenient (and 3-12 times cheaper depending on electricity rates and fuel taxes) than the hassle of fueling a combustion vehicle, performance EVs can outperform combustion vehicles on almost every metric and there are other advantages like the ability to remotely pre-heat/cool the vehicle (very handy for quick grocery trips in winter, you can leave the car off and locked with climate running or preheat your vehicle when the movie credits roll).\n\nI used to own an E90 M3... yet my favorite vehicle is the i3....

I never said disposing of nuclear waste is nearly impossible. That's what you said. Let's take a moment to review what I said:\nNuclear creates hazardous radioactive waste that's difficult to impossible to neutralize and dispose of.\n\n\n\nEverything in my statement is true and factual. Nuclear waste is hazardous and dangerous and extremely difficult to safely and properly dispose of. Nuclear waste from fission reactors takes thousands of years to decay down to safe levels of radioactivity--it's really nasty stuff. You make it sound like nuclear waste disposal is safe, easy, and simple--all that's required is to burn it up. LOL You're living in fantasy land if you think that you can simply burn up nuclear waste as though it's just a pile of leaves sitting in your backyard and all you have to do to get rid of it is to burn it up.\n\n\nsaturnday: Nuclear power is a superior alternative because you can produce it at night when the wind isn't blowing.\n-----\nYes, it's true that nuclear power can be produced day and night, and regardless of the weather. Is nuclear power superior to solar or wind? Well, that's a matter of opinion. My opinion is that solar and wind are superior to nuclear for a whole bunch of reasons, with the top reasons being that solar and wind are completely safe, have zero impact on the environment, cost very little on both an absolute scale, as well as a relative one, and are the easiest technologies to implement--no PhD or master's degree or specialized knowledge is required.\n\n\nsaturnday: Renewables always suffer from downtime.\n-----\nYes, renewable energy can suffer from occasional downtime, but that can be mitigated, or eliminated, with a larger capacity battery array. In addition, downtime from renewables is a minor trade-off in order to obtain all of its benefits, some of which I mentioned above. Battery technology is always improving, and in my opinion, it's the key to making solar and wind the de facto standard for current methods of commercial, or personal, energy production, as well as future methods. With improved battery technology, it'll cost less to store energy from solar or wind, and then have that stored energy be available 24/7 for either continuous or on demand use.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "you5711"}

Tesla is pushing for cost savings in battery packs through MASS production of cells and packs in their partnership with Samsung. Even their own goals are to get the cost down to ~100$/kwh in a completed pack. Their top range cars have a capacity of 100kwh so that's 10,000 just for the pack. Other manufacturers are ~50-100% higher cost on batteries so even a modest 50kwh battery will cost those companies ~7k lets say.  \n\n\nThe second reason is production size. Cheap vehicles are cheap because they produce millions of units and when you are producing at such a mass scale you can get the costs of each part very low and keep costs down. The profit margins on those vehicles are usually VERY small (trucks are a different story, reason why companies are ditching their sedan lines heavily)  \n\n\nThird is service model. Traditional manufacturers make fairly little from selling you a vehicle. (like couple percent profit margins at best). The money is in their dealership model for trade ins, used vehicle sales and maintenance. The service department in a dealership is where a huge percentage of their profits come from. With EVs having very little regular scheduled maintenance dealerships absolutely hate them because they cant survive selling them.

Heck, some of the next gen fission reactors operate in temperature ranges where the waste heat left over AFTER power generation could be used to desalinate sea water and solve other major issues with nuclear. Just look into the Molten Salt Reactors... not a new concept, nor a fairy tale either, one ran for five years in the 60s without major issue but was canceled in favor of the fast reactor programs. \n\nThe other thing is that fission waste streams are still highly manageable.

I am not denying that the current fission reaction is our best source of energy at this current time. Outside of the extremely radioactive waste that is generated by fission, there is really no major draw backs. However, Fusion reactors make no waste, and require an extremely low density fuel, such as hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe (as far as we know), plus with the proper scrubbers to control the fusion reaction, we will collect massive quantities of hydrogen just through the whole fusion reaction process. The other benefit, is we will not need to mine in to the earth for Uranium (which is a fairly \"rare\" element compared to hydrogen). Then there is far less production needed to made hydrogen usable for a fusion reaction, vs the large amount of time, energy and money that is required to process Uranium in to a viable fuel source.

Therefore - they are basically running all the time they can because of cost.\r\nThen there is gas and nuclear power plant which are more expensive but still cheaper then fossil fuel power plants.\r\nProof - On US energy information administration website - Table 8.4. Average Power Plant Operating Expenses from 2007 - 2017\n\r\nSo, what's the catch?\r\nFossil fuel power plants are last in a row to firing up where there is a demand in electrical grid for electricity.\r\nSurprisingly, still fossil power plant produce huge 31% electricity in USA!\r\nBut who is demanding extra power in grid which is cause to get electricity from fossil? Electric cars for sure! \r\nBecause, we can't say that devices and machines which we were using before electric car were on the road are creating extra demand.\r\nEvery extra demand for electricity is cause to get those power from fossil, because all other sources of electricity are working 100% and they aren't enough!\r\n\r\nNow would someone say, yeah, but then also my microwave get some power from fossils! That is true, but you don't have option to run your microwave on gasoline.\r\n\r\nAlso someone might say: I live in Idaho and we don't have fossil power plants! That's true, but you need to understand how electrical network works.\r\nAll states in USA are synchronised in one electrical grid and electricity doesn't know about borders of states.\r\nTherefore if you plug in your electric car in Idaho you will probably get some electricity from Utah and Wyoming where most power come from fossil.\r\nI live in Croatia, and most our energy comes from hydro power plants. But we can't produce enough energy for ourself and we import energy from Serbia and Bosnia&Hercegovina, where most energy comes from coal.\r\nSo when I plug in electric car, some poor guy in Bosnia is choking in bad air while eating ƒáevapi.\r\n(ƒáevapi - traditional Bosnian food)\r\n\r\nConclusion: If electric cars in USA consume less than 31% of overall produced energy in country, be sure that electric cars is causing fossil power plants to work more to produce same amount of energy as needed for electric car.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Lalosch90"}

Increasing or decreasing electricity usage is not going to affect the amount of hydro power generation. No-one is going to spill the dam water because you didn't plug in your car.\nEnergy for your E-car comes from gas, coal or (potentially) nuclear, depending on circumstances. During the day, marginal electrical generation comes from gas. During the night, most baseline power comes from coal. (In the long term, if America starts making different choices, the power might come from nuclear but not yet.) That means the most appropriate calculation is something like the West Virginia mix, with the best case payback time of 5 years.\nAs for the state-by-state variation, that's a fallacy, too. We all live on the grid. When you plug in your electric car in Idaho, that Joule of hydro is taken from someone else who now has to get his Joule from out-of-state.

It's everyone's favorite electricity source but you can't have more of it. All the best rivers are taken. Using more electricity will not affect the amount of hydro generation so it is irrelevant to marginal cost.\nSadly, that principle holds more generally. Whatever our favorite source is, its production is probably constrained. Otherwise, we would make more of it.

You're subtracting 5% then 10% then 15% from 100%, but you're forgetting that those losses have occurred while subtracting the subsequent percentages. 5+10+15=30, and 100-30=70, but that isn't what's actually occurring because you're not dealing with whole numbers, your dealing with percentages which are not whole numbers, they're fractions.\n\nFirst you have 100% of the energy in something that the power plant uses to generate electricity, but it loses 5% of that energy in the process, leaving you with 95% turned into electricity. Next you have the AC to DC conversion loss of 10%, but you're only losing 10% of the 95% that remains from the losses at the power plant, so you're not losing 10% of the original input energy, you're losing 10% of 95%, which is only 9.5% of the original input. This leaves you with 85.5% of the original, rather than the 85% you were calculating. Next you lose another 15%, but it's not 15% of the original 100% input energy, because you've already lost 14.5% of that upstream, so you're only losing 15% of the remaining 85.5%, which doesn't leave you with 70%, it leaves you with 72.675%, which is nearly 3% more than your calculation showed.\n\nI'm only using your numbers because those are what you showed, and the real numbers are different than those, but you'd still be making that basic mathematical calculation error even if you had the real numbers, and it's that error that you need to correct the most, because you'll get EVERY calculation wrong if you don't, not just this one. Remember that when you're calculating something using a sequence of separate equations and passing the output of one to the next equation in the chain, you have to calculate the actual output of each upstream equation before adding in the effects of the next equation in the sequence, otherwise you're factoring out all of the necessary equations and just adding your variables together independent of the necessary math. It's a very easy error to make for anyone who doesn't depend on math for a living, tons and tons of people do this, even people who you wouldn't think would do it, and sometimes even people who others depend on to get their math right, like politicians and business operators who think that raising the minimum wage will not benefit anyone because the higher costs will more than offset the increase in wages, even though mathematically the opposite is true.

Electruc is not superior when you need to compare power to weight ratio that is why no semi is 100 percent electric unless it is running on almost fully flat ground. The amount of batteries needed to run a semi up hill carring a load would limit the distance they could travel to a few hundred miles. There are many limitations to electric motors. 1 important one is it takes much longer to charge a electruc car then it does to fuel up one with gas.

Even when we all switch from larger gashuzzling cars to a smaller type of EV, the sudden rise in emisions will still be at least a 40-50% increase of todays' car production!!! \n\nSo I am not so shure the environment will see the sudden exponential rise of global emisions as being that \"friendly\" \n\nTry explaining mother nature \"here mom drink this, you will get even more ill or might even die, but if you survive you might be able to start recovery in 5 years from now\".... \nWonder if 'mom' will see that as being friendly... \n\nWe are trying to get long term lower emissions by first creating a enourmous boost of global emissions....

Heavy metals in particular are already a big enough problem the consumption too much fish can have negative health implications due to the amount of mercury present in them.\nI also wonder how much energy Lithium Ion batteries require to be recycled as the process liquid nitrogen which is extremely energy intensive.\n\nA last part: I'm getting rather frustrated listening to people saying that there's no maintenance on electric cars as there are less moving parts. When did you last do any big job on an internal combustion engine? Most of the work nowadays happens on vehicles to rectify little gremlins:\nStuck power windows, aircon playing up, power steering giving issues.\nAll that is present in electric vehicles and Tesla has been notorious for issues with these components.\n\nIn my opninion the greenest solution is to switch to greener liquid fuel - i.e. grown from algae to avoid destroying even more land.\nThat would work with current technology and infrastructure as it doesn't take much to convert vehicles to run on ethanol.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "djpalme"}

Are you talking about the once in a blue moon that a nuclear plant may vent an immeasurable amount of steam as part of their hydrogen buildup mitigation techniques? The like once in a decade release that is required to be stored so that 95% of the radioactivity that may be in it is nearly immeasurable? The release that the EPA regulates so tightly that it can only be done so as to minimize the release? That release? Completely negligible to the environment....  not even measurable outside of some seriously sensitive equipment and is extremely short lived... less than a year. \n\nTritium exists in nature... it has a silly short half life of 8 days in the human body and 12 years in the wild. Releases from power plants is again extremely small. You are exposed to more tritium by walking down the back hallways of your work near the emergency exit signs than has every been released by a \"leaking\" nuclear plant...\n\nThe fuel rods are indeed highly radioactive. No doubt about it. They aren't water soluble, they don't readily burn and are extremely hard to move without someone noticing. As far as a waste stream is concerned, they are about perfect... no gases to worry about, no melting to worry about, no turning into giant radioactive rivers of ash mud (coal fly ash piles)... as far as radioactive emissions are concerned, spent nuclear fuel isn't even on the radar. Radon releases from natural gas is.  Thorium, uranium, polonium, lead, and radon from coal absolutely are though....  in significantly higher quantities with near zero regulation. \n\nAs for SNF's radioactivity, 95% of SNF is U238 which is no more radioactive today than the day it came out of the ground. About 1% is plutonium and other trans uranic elements which are conveniently fissile or fertile (meaning they can be used as fuel).  The remaining 4% are fission products that are the real source of the radiation risk of SNF... the longest lived of which is made in extremely small quantities and emits less radiation than background radiation. The vast majority of what is left has half lives of about 30 years or less.  That means storing for 300 years if we reprocess everything else out. \n\nFurthermore, long half lives are actually desirable from a waste handling perspective. There are only so many ways for something to decay via radiation... those methods have known every values and risks but suffice to say if you have 500 atoms of two elements with one having a 5 year half life and the other a 5 million year half life and both decay by alpha decay... the first will dump the shine amount of energy in 5 years as the second will in 5 million... so longer half lives means less risk to people and the environment from a radiation standpoint.  This is easily demonstrated by giving you a sample of uranium 238 which has an extremely long half life of 4.468 billion years and comparing that to something like xenon 135 with a half life of 9.2 hours... the uranium will only kill you if you eat it because of its chemical toxicity... the radiation would take several lifetimes to kill you compared to the toxicity of eating a heavy metal.  The xenon would just kill you nearly instantly from radiation sickness....", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Whiskey's Gaming Lounge"}

Mostly, that‚Äôs about reducing the number of types of cell to be dealt with.  It‚Äôs really hard to create a machine that can de-manufacture 200 different types of batteries.\n\nSo, what comes in the door is a large, multi-module battery used at a 400KW fast-DC EV charger, or at an office building as UPS, or at a large solar array to supply power at night when the array clearly can‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs one of several-to-many refrigerator-sized boxes of battery cells from that site, found to be not performing up-to-spec anymore, thus to be ‚Äúend-of-lifed.‚Äù  That, after 20 years in that role, in turn after 10-15 years time spent in an EV.  The battery cells in that box are all of the same type, having all come from Tesla Model 3 cars originally, or at least they are each one of 3-4 very-similar types.  Even better, the box contains about 30,000 cells ‚Äî a ‚Äúbountiful harvest,‚Äù so to speak.  \n\nFirst, factory workers and their machines disassemble the physical boxes, remove the battery modules, and remove the individual cells from the modules.  Currently, we can‚Äôt do much more than that economically, but 20 years from now, they will feed the individual cells into the ‚ÄúTesla 2170 de-manufacturing machine,‚Äù which peels off the metal casing, washes out the electrolyte, separates and cleans the graphite anode, unwinds the cathode, made of a combination of metals.  It melts down the cathode metals and separates them out, and separates out the electrolyte materials.  \n\nThat‚Äôs a pretty doable de-manufacturing machine.\n\nIn the case of personal electronics, however, you have battery cells in the hands of 100s of millions of individual consumers.  Of the way-too-few that don‚Äôt end up in a landfill, they somehow have to be collected together, at a cost.  Among them, there are of ~300 different physical form factors (physical dimensions) and probably 5 different, largely-incompatible battery chemistries.

Those that have aren't super pleased with that simple claim. The range is about 90-100 miles, or 50 there and back if the destination does not have a charger.  Even going that far is a hard thermal hit on the battery and will require you to charge to 100% and drive it to 10%.  EVs should live between 30% and 85% to extend battery life.\n\n Electric has great smooth torque and easy tow driving feel, but weight and rolling resistance make battery towing impractical.  Also a lot of things being towed are heavier than 5000 lbs.  RVs are often heavier.  Larger than 20 ft boats are often heavier.  5000 lbs is about the norm for polished yuppie toys behind sports cars, so 5000 lbs is probably the best limit, but if you live in hills or mountains don't expect to go very far.

The average plugin electric car only has an 11% higher combined thermal cycle efficiency. You cannot talk about electric vehicle emissions, without also discussing grid efficiency/emissions. Just going to the EPA website, and quoting some numbers doesn‚Äôt even come close to explaining the issue.\n\nFor starters the EPA website uses the GREET model, which has been criticized for favoring electric energy by using equivalent CO2, and then basing those numbers on the complete oil cycle (well to wheel), but not on the complete coal cycle (especially coal derived from mountain top removal), effectively making the equivalent number less than it actually is for electricity. It has also been widely criticized for using industry data with no accuracy requirement, like the EIA and other government agencies have. They also under reported direct land use GHG emissions from corn production for almost a decade, further perpetuating the idea that ethanol has a lower environmental impact than gasoline, when in fact it does not.\n\nA simple efficiency analysis in excel, using EIA data (that does have accuracy requirements), and some standard motor, battery, and drivetrain efficiency data, would be far more informative, and easier to understand. It would also put the problem into a rational perspective, comparing only a few simple cases to the entire US energy market, rather than vague, net positive eCO2 formulas.\nWhen it comes to the grid, and the power plants in it, they are old, dirty, and inefficient. No amount of analysis will make putting more energy thought it a good idea. I‚Äôm sure you can understand that models are not reality, only our best guess at it. When it comes to hard decisions, like where to build a factory, or which car to buy, it is best to stick with hard data.

I will also assume for the sake of the argument I am going to make that your comment about a \"... diesel engine makes you impotent...\" is correct (which it may well not be correct!).\n\nAs for the point I want to set out to make... It isn't that it WILL make someone impotent, it is that the CHANCE is higher that it will... When a Tobacco company says (or used to say) that \"There is no proof that smoking cigarettes causes cancer!\" they are, from a pure logic stand point correct! This is because the only time you can really prove something is in mathematics (generally speaking from my understanding)...\n\nYou can have an overwhelming pile of evidence that said activity may lead to or cause another, but that is all it is from a pure logic standpoint. Now do I (and I assume most people) think that the argument and TREMENDOUS PILE OF EVIDENCE that smoking causes cancer is correct? Yes. In everyday speak we call it (very) strong evidence or \"proof\".\n\nTo conclude, you are correct that \"... pretty much then everything is bad for everything...\". (I assume you mean that everything can be bad for you right?) However, drinking too much water can kill you as well, it doesn't mean you stop drinking water. You just don't drinks gallons of it in the course of minutes to an hour! If you know there is a high risk that some action will cause a bad result, you (typically) aren't going to take that risk. However you can try to minimize the risk. An everyday example would be instead of lifting by leaning over and having all the load on your back it would be safer FOR MOST PEOPLE to squat down and \"use their legs\" to do the lifting instead of their back... However that risk will probably be magnified if you are picking up a 50 to 100 pound package as opposed to picking up a dollar you have found on the ground (I also make the assumption that in both cases the circumstances is the same, you are lifting the package or the dollar off of a sidewalk for example...).", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Parker Hamilton"}

But I digress). It's a field shrouded in inference and half-truths and intentionally misleading. For these reasons, I must put my oar in.\n\n1:18 Citations used to mean something. But just citing even a peer reviewed study simply doesn't carry the weight it used to. There is corruption to the system. We live in a post-truth era. Simply failing to 'toe the company line' regularly sees people lose their livelihoods.\n\n1:47 Ignoring EOL emissions seems on the surface to be reasonable, considering the small proportion the make up relative to manufacturing and use emissions. However, this means you also neglect the frequency of the emissions and assume that both vehicles have a similar lifespan. I would argue that an ICE vehicle has a considerably longer lifespan given advancements in technology are not occurring anywhere near quite so dramatically and frequently so disposal of EVs would be at a higher rate as people move to vehicles with greater range etc. Age and mileage is not such a factor when they see that if they don't 'upgrade' now their old technology EV will be almost worthless soon with superior technology appearing. Wait a little too long in a fast moving technological landscape such as this and that EV will indeed be scrapped well before the ICE.\n \n4:15 Emissions for producing the battery. Is this just the actual manufacturing process, or does this also include the emissions from all the steps of materials mining and procurement?\n\n5:02 This table showing 5.2T of CO2 per year is for the AVERAGE petrol vehicle. The average petrol vehicle is NOT the same as the average EV. The average petrol vehicle would be larger with more load carrying capacity. I've yet to see an electric utility (pickup truck) vehicle. Unless you can isolate the comparable vehicles to obtain the correct figure, it is a clear disadvantage to the ICE vehicles in the same usage as the EVs. Your following example of the 4x4 pickup truck is a case in point. Its higher than average emissions indicate that vehicles in the same category of EVs (generally smaller hatchbacks) would have lower than average emissions.\n\n11:27 People and equipment need to be located in these remote lithium mining locations too. People need food which must be shipped in which takes energy and generates emissions... you see where I'm going, right?.\n\nOne critical thing that you've overlooked is the capital cost. Sure, directly, it's not related to emissions. But the high capital cost of EVs is a factor that may cause people to vary their other emissions producing activities. They may, because of the cost of debt servicing, chose not to purchase so-called 'green' foodstuffs - that is, more expensive virtue signalling low food miles foodstuffs. Or 'sustainably farmed' nonsense. There is an offset to this from the lower EV running costs. But the question remains as to what activities detrimental to their 'carbon footprint' will be suspended. Or perhaps they're well heeled and the savings from the lower EV running costs will simply mean more overseas holidays... flying there and back, of course. What I'm saying is what are the unintended consequences of people buying EVs that could in fact overall make their individual emissions no better or indeed worse? Given the claim is this is a global problem, we need to look at the scenarios holistically.\n\nOf course, all this CO2 emissions nonsense is predicated on the belief that CO2 is bad for the environment (greenhouse effect, acidification of oceans etc.) and we must curb our emissions by giving our money away as extra taxes.\n\nI simply don't buy it. The strongest advocates for 'climate change' (or whatever it's called this week) are hypocrites, even if you ignore the celebrities, as I do. Just look at Al Gore's carbon footprint. Of course, some will justify it because he's generating it bringing the message to the peasants. I say bollocks. Look up the Intergenerational Wealth organisation.\n\nCO2 has been much, much higher in the past - long before man was around. CO2 is plant food - the more CO2 the more plants converting it to oxygen and storing the evil carbon. Even assuming CO2 is bad, given it only contributes 20% to the greenhouse effect, and human emissions are responsible for about 4% of the annual CO2, by my calculations if all human CO2 emissions ceased tomorrow, that's a reduction of 0.8% of the greenhouse effect (0.20 x 0.04).

Even the likes of France and Germany still use significant natural gas for heating of buildings and domestic hot water.\nThe 'Total' CO2 emissions of Europe vs. USA are likely to be quite similar in 2018, with fully up to date figures. Per capita... it's a different story however.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Richard"}

Great video as usual, but you did miss in the calculation the cost (in CO2) of producing the fuel for gas cars.\nAnyway, I think the biggest benefit of electric cars is the big reduction of emissions inside the cities. That is the one reason that I would switch to electric vehicles, even if they pollute more now in the production stage. \nThen, the other big argument is the fact that the \"fuel\", meaning the electricity can be generated 100% from renewable sources, like solar, wind, water. Yes, there is a carbon footprint to build these renewables, but once you have them, they last a very long time. With gasoline cars, you cannot do that entirely. Yes, you can use biofuels, but that will require big patches of land, farming machinery, etc. \nAlso, tailpipe emissions can't be eliminated 100%, whereas electric cars are already emission free.\nSo all in all, we need to make this change. We need also to educate ourselves, use public transport more, since it is way more efficient compared to a car.

It can take up to 6 years of 24/7 activity and hundreds of millions of gallons of fossil fuels (diesel). Third,  I can list the respected earth and atmospheric scientists who have gone on record saying we need MORE CO2 in our atmosphere...in fact two or three times what we have now would be good for vegetation and the planet (Dr. Richard Lindzen, Dr. Iaver Giaver, Dr. Tim Ball, Dr. William Happer, and many many others).

I don't think you realize what an underground mine is. An underground mine is where a large diameter hole  30 feet by 30 feet square is blasted into rock down to a level where an orebody can be mined and auxiliary infrastructure that makes mining possible can be built, like sumps to trap water and fine materials from drilling into ore for example.  This 30 foot by 30 foot hole ( some are much larger) go down 10,000 feet or more (19,000 feet in South Africa). The nickel mine I work at is 4,400 feet deep, and mining has gone down lower by way of ramp to 4,750 feet. To give you some idea about what it takes to build a mine I'll describe the activities.\n#1 a helicopter flies over wilderness carrying a magnetometer to search for metallics.\n#2 a team of geologists hits the ground collecting \"grab samples\" of rock for analysis.(Fuel to heat tents and power quads and boats)\n#3 a diamond drilling rig is hauled up by truck or flown in by helicopter( Aviation fuel) to drill and delineate a possible ore body. (diesel)\n#4 A small camp is built and materials for it are trucked in or flown in ( fossil fuels)\n#5 after a couple of years of economic feasibility studies a decision is made to build a mine.Many millions of gallons of fossil fuels are required to truck or fly stuff in...and to operate the mine.\n    Oil on the other hand is where people assemble a drill rig, drill a hole the size of a 2 foot pipe until they hit oil. It's slightly different for fracking. And it is much more fossil fuels intensive for deep sea oil rigs...but once they have a rig they can just move it anywhere...you can't move a shaft in rock is the point I would make.

Objectively speaking, it is an emission source an EV might effect that an ICE does not. This is something that must be taken into consideration.

Obviously, EVs produce fewer emissions as stand-alone objects, but if they negatively impact emissions overall what's the point? To completely disregard its potentially harmful effects for my hubris isn't progress it's being as blind and short sited as the \"rest of the population.\" I'm willing to bet you would be spinning a different tale if the world drove EV and it was discovered that the newly developed ICE would reduce emissions by 1000% even though it has emissions.\n\nPerhaps, my post wouldn't be so triggering if I didn't use the word efficient. Though it is an apt term. EVs has the potential to increase emissions overall versus the way things are now, based on various factors. This is not definitely the case, but it is something one should be considerate of when planning the transition to EVs. Especially when the purpose of doing so is to reduce emissions.

In the case of the EV, this would be working out the emission cost to generate the electricity used to charge the vehicle.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Milan Shah"}

Once produced, its either used or lost in the grid. Meaning that if every one gets an EV you need to increase the maximum of energy production at every time to accommodate that increase in usage even if you are not charging (meaning that you could be producing energy and no one is using). Because if you do not have a safe guard the grid will collapse once the extra car is connected. Also, you forget energy from dams  (for example) affect the ecosystem of the rivers and change the planet. So, it is very difficult to know if until what degree it is that simple. \n2. Also, good to mention that batteries get low in capacity after 2 to 3 years.  \n3. Plus, you are comparing cars like v8 with a EV. That is a problem liking with big engine size (comparing onions with tomatoes here). You should compare apples for apples and not use a country that favors big and heavy gasoline engines. The average mpg used in the website is almost 12 liters per 100km. What cars are you using in the study (trucks :))? I think you should go reasonable and aim to 8 liters/100km (what a normal 1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6 or 1.8 is able to do in combined driving). I believe that was a fair comparison. \nI think that if you only look at the production it makes sense. However, the problem is very little related with the actual production of the EV vs gas car but with the production of energy and batteries vs the usage of gasoline and exploration of petrol. \nContinue the good work", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Pedro Moreira"}

Most of the world's supply of cobalt comes from the Congo. Child labor is near epidemic, groundwater, rivers and streams are so polluted that the water is undrinkable and no good for irrigation. Cobalt dust is causing respiratory illness for miners and children are being born with high numbers of birth defects .  Scientists have also sited alarming radiation levels because uranium also litters some cobalt mining sites. Nickel is extracted through strip mining, and the processing of nickel emits lead, arsenic and hydrogen sulfide, among a long list of other less than environmentally friendly chemicals. In some places, so much sediment has made it into waterways,  entire ecosystems have been destroyed as part of the mining process. Extracting Lithium from the environment does its share of environmental damage too, which you did mention, but it is the least impactful of the the 3 metals mentioned here.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "xnetpc"}

It STILL takes at LEAST 11 years to reach ROI on electric vs ICE.  If someone has to pay more, then the reality is that the thing actually took WAY more energy to make.  Both by way of the materials and by way of all the more people involved down the chain of production.  I can't get a GenX Civic all electric EX Sedan for the same price as what I paid even if such a thing existed.  I would pay a 25% premium if I knew that I would never pay for gas again but that is not even the difference in an equivalent people mover right now.  My EX Sedan cost me $30,000 on the road in Canadian.  The ONLY things that are in the same general bracket of functionality and size are the Bolt and really, the Model 3.  The Model 3 is only available for a whopping $91,000 after tax in Canada.  Even the Bolt would be $60 grand on the road.  I would be further ahead to STILL get the Civic and put solar on my house with the other $30,000.  Even in the magical world of Tesla selling the $35k USD M3, that is still almost $55,000 Canadian after tax.  NO NO NO NO...  (Even the Honda Clarity plugin hybrid (Basically a Civic) is FAR too expensive to have a reasonable ROI for average duration of ownership) (Also note that the Prius Plugin lacks all of the radar and camera systems that my Civic has AND still costs over $46,000 Canadian on the road)\n\nWhen the decision is SAME price (And ALL same features) or +10% and it is between a slower refill by say 10 minutes vs 5 for gasoline.  Done and done.  I will buy an electric without pause.  The VAST majority of people are NOT super wealthy virtue signaling celebrities or YouTube stars.  We live normal lives making average salaries and have to be careful with our money or someone doesn't eat or a bill goes unpaid and your credit score goes to hell.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong.  Electric motors are indeed the future.  The issue is that batteries are not.  Graphene based capacitors are the only truly viable solution.  Even fuel cells have issues as far as getting the hydrogen into the market.  A capacitor powered world is a vastly more efficient world with no sacrifices in speed to refill your energy in ANY application.  They are the fastest to charge and have a MASSIVE life expectancy compared to batteries.  They are also FAR less damaging to the environment to make and are actually biodegradable.\n\nIf you have the money to virtue signal, then you likely live a life that is already generating a LOT of CO2 in many other completely avoidable ways.

Was it a hybrid or was it a fully electric vehicle? Because you can't really compare a hybrid vehicle to the electric vehicle, as the former in regards to that CO2 emission level would have a measly battery, only good for a short commute, and for the latter - for that CO2 to be correct, you would need to factor in the cost of production of a small battery (from your example) PLUS the cost of production of a regular car (which is what a hybrid car is, without a battery).        Also, you need to factor in the aging of the battery. The more it ages, the less energy it can store, making it less efficient, while it still retains the original CO2 cost, and its weight.

I live near eight lanes of heavily travelled highway that contains five traffic signals in a half-mile interval. The pollution is immense when all of those vehicles accelerate away from a signal. On a cold winter morning, gasoline engines are not much better than diesels until their catalyst warms up after several miles of driving. Then there is the noise. Electric motors are quiet. ICE vehicles make plenty of noise while they are accelerating briskly. The worst noise of all is when the big rigs hit the jake brake to stop at a red light. Also, consider the carcinogenic,  polluting drain oil produced by ICE vehicles. Some of it leaks out, causing oil slicks on wet pavement and pollution of waterways. How much drain oil does not get proper disposal? At a minimum, diesels should be banned ASAP, except for heavy long-haul vehicles and construction equipment.

The other thing is that the infrastructure is already in place and while it might need up updating. The amount of electric that those plants put off even being \"dirty\" if more efficient than internal combustion engines even factoring in power lose as most power plants are designed to recycle heat to further get more power, while internal combustion engines in a vehicle doesn't, which is internal combustion is only about a 20% (average) thermal efficiency while power plants about 60% for \"dirty\" energy. Power lines carry about a 15% (in the high end) loss so let's say plants produce only 51% efficient before getting to your home than charging you lose 20% (high end still) of that 51% so now 40.8% efficient. The efficiency of a electric car on the low end is about 70% of that 40.8% or 28.56% of the initial fuel. So unless you have an internal combustion engine with an higher than average thermal efficiency, it will always be greener to drive an electric car, even the of low efficiency ones. Are there internal combustion that does have a higher efficiency? Yes or at least a few automakers claim they do Toyota actually claimed they had one that approached 40% which means, in most cases it would beat all electric vehicles unless it was charged with solar.

The amount of windmills produced by California alone which numbers the hundreds is still only creating 5.5 gigawatts as of 2017 and the grand coulee dam itself creates 21 gigawatts. So we have some major problems already with the power grid due to finances. Environmental impact like natural gas and no more new hydro or nuclear so we are stuck with you guessed it. Building more natural gas power plants and coal. Not good.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Nicholas Larson"}

What people over look is the fact that the earth goes through many cycles. We all know about the water cycle but most don't think about the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Each of these cycles are continuous cycles that produce the fossil fuels we use today. Oil is not a resource that is gone once used up. It is simply apart of several of earths natural cycle's in which it will continually be produced whether we burn it or not.  People forget that Oil company's were originally given the task of finding a use for oil to \"clean up the environment\" . Most lakes we know as fresh water lakes in the US were oil lakes. Not to mention all the land that was covered in oil. It is My Opinion that to a point atmospheric emissions are completely regulated by earth cycles we as humans can take part in those cycles however we really can't affect them.  In my area they have been conducting some serious air study's trying to prove that drilling for oil causes poor air quality. In the last 10 year's this area has gone from over 300 drilling rigs to 1 and at times 0  but the air quality has not changed. Because forest fires and volcanic activity has taken over when they quit drilling. The obvious outcome is that the earth was designed to take care of itself humans can have minor local affects on local climates but in the big scheme of things we really can't change anything.

To explain reality: CO2 is not a pollutant.\n\nWhen battery tech is developed to the state of being zip-chargeable and capable of containing enough energy to compete with a liquid-fuelled vehicle of an identical weight, there will be a pivot towards electric formats, but, in the meantime, the only advantage is in replacing vehicles that produce diesel particulates in cities. Hydrogen-fuel-cell technology has been somewhat suppressed, though it solves many of the issues of both classic combustion engines and EVs. It should also be noted that the harmful effects associated with diesel fumes and other genuine pollutants were exacerbated by regulators who forced the motor industry to conform to hysterical CO2 restrictions, which spawned the switch from petrol to overdeveloped diesel in most domestic vehicles, thereby making Europe's cities far more unhealthy over decades than would have been the case if petrol-engine development had not been sidelined.\n\nTo sum up: In the interim before a paradigm shift in lightweight, high-capacity, quick-charge battery tech, (and assuming the corrupting influence of politics for profit plays no part in diverting us from the most sensible and effective personal choices) companies should consider unleashing the sales potential of hydrogen-power, as well as researching the benefits of turbine-hybrids for commercial long-haul and passenger-transport applications. As far as I can tell, the simple concept of a turbine generator feeding an electric motor drivetrain has not been implemented in the haulage industry, yet it would seem to offer massive advantages in any sector where high-torque vehicles are operated for long periods without being switched off.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "The Eternal Thursday Teatime of Nowtimes Past"}

Simply ignores the fact that the gas has to come from crude oil which is hard to extract and creates CO2 in the process, has to be refined which uses electrical power plants and the staggering amount of power I spoke of (more CO2), has to follow a supply chain to the gas station (Yet more CO2). It assumes that the Gas used in the gas car comes from (as you put it) 'Unicorn farts'  my point is simply that in order for a fair comparison you must also include the Gas supply chain CO2 emmisions for the gas that goes in the gas car. The refining process, delivery to site down the supply chain all increases the CO2 of the Gas powered car. So comparing an EV with a Gas powered car but ignoring the CO2 on the supply chain and refinement process for the gas car is simply not a fair comparison. It also does not take into consideration the fact that an EV will get cleaner as the electricity supply chain moves tp renewable energy sources. This means EVs get cleaner as a Country cleans up its CO2 emissions.   I take your point about the electricity in an EV using oil as well to create the electricity, and that is already included in this video. The bit that is missing is the same for the gas that goes in the gas car. A staggering amount of electricity is used to refine oil,  please do the research, it will be well worth it. You will see just how much. On another note, here in the UK it is easy to select an electricity supplier that contributes 100% renewable energy to the grid and by using these companies the EV is effectively running on 100% renewable energy. Sure I understand that the grid is a blend of different sources but by taking a 100% green supplier I am contributing to a growing community of consumers that are actively reducing the UK mix closer and closer to a higher percentage of 100% renewable sources in the grid.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Harry Crawford"}

So you end up whit limited regions where you can impliment it and not use up usefull land . On top of the space/power output problem solar panels more specifically solar farms does change the local climate and the disrupt the local wildlife . So its best we use solar in the subburbs and urban regions out side the main city centers where it can be used to offset the local consumption. As for solar grid management thats a hell in its self and very expensive to maintain and set up the load battery neaded for offset pruduction are some times more expensive then the solar setup its self . Germany for example for dacades have disrupted polish and cz lines whit there \"eco\" power pruduction by transferring the excess power at peak production time to poland and on multiple cases puting down the whole polish power grid to the point where poland just disconected from the german powergrid until they stopped there production. So you see solar is grate but on smaller scale when you can use your roof parts of your yard to set up a personal production that will offset your power needs espessaly in the spring/summer to early winter days but its not a thing you would want to rely on for industry.

Hmmm... maybe my 19 years old, small engine (by US standards anyway) car is not that great for to the environment after all :P. On the other hand, I make less than 8k miles a year and my CO2 emissions are at ~200g/km, so about 2.5 metric tons of CO2/year. Not great, but not THAT bad either. \nSpeaking of emissions per unit of distance: is that the average emissions of that engine or is calculated for a certain load? I assume it can't be the maximum value. That would change a lot of these statistics. Most of the engines are very rarely used at their max power. \nEdit: I just verified how it's calculated - the CO2/km or /mile is based on the average fuel consumption of the engine. In hindsight, I should have figured this out just through common sense :) So, if you're driving a lot of extra-urban miles, your car runs actually a bit greener than what the spec sheet says.

The carbon cycle is balanced in nature between production and storage, however humans are inputting more carbon (in for the form of CO2 and CH4) into the atmosphere which is taking the carbon cycle out of equilibrium. There is too much production for the natural environment to absorb and store. Combine that with compounding factors such as deforestation and you have a serious problem.\n\nCO2 absorbs longwave radiation specifically in the infra-red spectrum. Longwave radiation is the result of solar energy hitting the earth surface and reflecting it back into space. Thus a small amount of the reflected solar radiation is stored in the atmosphere as heat. This is the very definition of a pollutant - a substance or energy that is put into a system that has undesirable or adverse effects.\n\nNow, you want to talk about other pollutants. Sure, ICE produce NOx, CH4 and SO2. All of these are potent greenhouse gases. An electric vehicle produces very little of these emissions and the only real source would be from power generation used to charge the batteries.\n\nWe can also look at volatile organic matter, particulate matter 10 um (PM10) and PM2.5 all of which are only produced by ICE and not electric vehicles and are a key component of poor air quality, respiratory issues and premature deaths. \n\nLastly, photochemical smog is primarily composed of ozone (O3) which is a byproduct again of ICE and not electric vehicles.

We then take that and use it to produce crude oil for biofuels. Algae itself doesn't produce crude oil/petoleum.\n\nThe overwhelming scientific consensus on oil and gas formation is that it is a biotic process resulting from dead organisms being heated and squeezed to form crude oil. It is more than a theory. It is very easy to explain, once dead organisms get deposited they are not exposed to oxygen preventing aerobic bacteria from breaking it down. It then preserves and over geologic timescales will eventually be subjected to heat and pressure. Oil is less dense than rock so it flows upwards through porous rocks before it reaches an impermeable layer or cap. The oil is now trapped in its host rock or reservoir. An old well that has oil in it again simply means that new oil has flowed through the reservoir to where the well is. Or is every petroleum geologist that has ever existed wrong??? Geology was literally built off understanding sedimentary basins and knowing how and where oil will form. \n\nI'm assuming you mean carbon is plant food? Ok so lets use that analogy then. Water is also plant food and fundamental for photosynthesis. What happens if you over water a plant? It dies. What was once a good thing, is now a bad thing. I love eating pizza, if i eat 300kg of pizza. I'll die.\n\nFinally the old CO2 lags temperature debate....global temperatures ARE driven by CO2. The concept that rising temperatures causes CO2 to rise is correct..... for the southern hemisphere. In the north, temperature lagged CO2 (skakun et al. 2012). About 18,000 years ago our orbital cycle shifted slightly and slightly more radiation reached the earth causing the southern ocean to warm. Increased temperature of a liquid reduces the solubility of gases in it, in this case CO2. Warming ocean temperatures started to give off CO2 (Martin et al. 2005). This initiates a positive feedback where more CO2 means more warming and more warming means more CO2. This increased warming from CO2 is what took us out of last glacial cycle into our present interglacial. \n\nThe slight increase in warming from a change in the Milankovitch (sun) cycles has been shown time and again to not be enough to explain the amount and rate of warming observed coming out of the last glacial. CO2 initially lagged temperature rise, but it absolutely reinforced warming once the process was initiated. I love it when people use this to try and anthropogenic climate change.... this entire concept of CO2 lagging temp is not new and was published by Lorius in 1990. It isn't some conspiracy or cover up. It has been in the literature for 2 decades. \n\nI can keep going.

There's no need to worry about CO2 emissions but rather pollutants such as PMs and nitrous oxides. The argument being made against CO2 is false. The comparison should have been between obvious harmful pollutants from ICE verses the toxicity of lithium, cobalt and nickel produced in quantity for battery production. Lithium reacts violently in water and spontaneously ignites in air. There are many stories of Lithium ion batteries combusting.\n\n\nEngineering Explained failed to mention that because there's finite quantity of Lithium available it would not be possible to replace every ICE vehicle with an EV equivalent.

This eliminates your flawed logic, and even if the renewables are grid tied, that does not make the car run on fossil fuels; it is just horrible logic.

At that point, to me anyway, it then comes down to cost. In most cases, BEVs are a very expensive way to achieve a little extra CO2 emissions reduction relative to HEVs.

That seems to be true of ICEs in general. I recently saw an interview with one of the lead researchers at Argonne National Laboratory in which he said, given all the areas in which ICEs can be made more efficient, ICEVs with fuel economies of 75 mpg should be doable. If that's true, then the average American driving a vehicle as fuel efficient as that would emit 2 tons of CO2 per year. For comparison, the average American driving a Chevrolet Volt in California emits about 1.7 tons of CO2 per year, and driving a Model S emits about 1.3 tons of CO2 per year. Once embodied emissions are taken into account, the highly fuel efficient ICEV could actually have a smaller CO2 footprint over its full lifecycle. Much will depend on how emissions intensive electricity production is, and if, and to what degree, manufacturing processes can be decarbonized (although the latter would likely affect both ICEVs and BEVs). In the developing world, fuel efficient ICEVs are likely to be the lowest emissions option, and are also likely to be the most economically realistic option as well.

Your comparing electric cars , to the average ICE emissions vehicle.  those ICE emissions include trucks from large industrial type trucks ie(gmc kodiac ford f750) to crew cab 4wd trucks.  maybe you should compare electric car emissions to idk passenger sedans , wagons , and coups instead ?  I noticed this is also a flaw on the \"Alternative fuels Data Center\" Website. There is no electric truck than can touch the abilities of a gas or diesel truck yet or that is in production on mass that i know of.  But,  the teslas and others are definitely reasonable competitors to other ICE passenger cars.  This study might be more reasonable in 10 years when there are some electric trucks and semis which will inevitably take way larger batteries / motors in turn produce more emissions to create.  But until then you  are essentially comparing the average electric car emissions which include nissan leafs , tesla's ext all relatively small cars  , to the average vehicle market which ranges from smart cars to F750 trucks. Not exactly a honest assessment even though its not on purpose. If you could find the emissions of the average 2,4,5,6 seater passenger sedans ext and compare that to the hybrid equivalent it would be a much more honest analysis.but i think its important to leave out basically all trucks of any kind and all Full Size SUVs. it will probably made a big difference in the average Co2 creating per vehicle.  my guess is that the electric car still wins the assessment but that the margins between the two become much narrower even in states with clean electric generation..", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Dalton Michaels"}

Gas engines aren't efficient. They range from 20%-40% efficiency. You don't need something to be efficient if it doesn't pollute and there is an endless supply of fuel, you need it to be practical; And based on current battery tech, Batteries aren't practical, which makes them worse than something that isn't efficient. Charge times are long, ranges are short, they take up a massive amount of space if you want good performance, weigh way too much, and can lose up to 30% of their range/charge in cold weather environments (like where I live). Plus, last time I checked you can buy a gallon of liquid hydrogen for ~$0.90 USD, which already makes it 3-5 times cheaper than gas and the price would only drop if it was produced on large scales. While batteries work for short range trips, you aren't taking vacations in an EV unless you want it to take significantly longer to arrive at your destination. Tech will get better and I'm sure EV's will have some of their weak points bettered, but I don't think they will ever reach the practical performance of ICE engines whether that be gas, hydrogen, or something else and I'd rather have a car that runs on hydrogen to produce electricity to get the best of both worlds. The range, time savings, and practicality of a liquid fuel mixed with the performance, instant response, and cleanliness of an electric vehicle. I'm not here to argue, I'm just stating my opinions and if yours are different, that's fine. Businesses will do what they want and R&D will result in whatever future tech people think best. Not saying it's ready now, there is still a ton of research that needs to be done in both fields, I just think Hydrogen research is getting shafted because batteries produced results first and faster, but like someone above mentioned, batteries are hitting a wall right now.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Novak 78"}

There is almost no oversight of the mining industries inn those countries, and the foreign companies that own the mines have no one to answer to. The mining practices of S.

(~50x as much) They often show the statistics from the World Bank that shows the US being the second producer of CO2 emissions and China being 10th. Lol. Regardless of how blatantly false that is, that's not including the thousands of factories in China that have ZERO oversight in hazardous waste disposal and pollution control. (What oversight there is, it's usually taken care of through h√≥ngbƒÅo¬†bribes; the way their entire culture/covenant is run.) If you've ever been to Guangdong, where a lot of the factories are, you will have seen the blatant pollution. One other huge source of their pollution is precursor chemicals for the production of drugs. (Fentanyl, ketamine, ecstasy, and amphetamines; legal or otherwise.) Normal labs have companies that come in to collect and process the chemicals from syntheses, but they go down the drain, or are collected by companies and are dumped in the ocean or on land in the investor of the country.

It's not fair comparison if you count only the emission coming from the gas car tail pipe and compared to the emissions coming from the  electric cars tail pipe (zero) AND also the from the production of the \"Go juice\".  If you count emissions from electricity production shouldn't you also count emissions from  gasoline production to make real comparison with the same starting points?  I think you did great job when talking about of the initial emissions when producing the car but I can't rub my head around why did you leave out gasoline production if you counted electricity productions emissions? I would like to know why is that?\n\nI know you mentioned oil drilling when talking about lithium mining but oil drilling is constant for the car to run and not one time thing when it's produced and also there is lot more emissions going around from gasoline production than just drilling oil.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Sakru100"}

Until most electricity is clean, comparisons should focus mostly on energy efficiency in transport and use, not production. Electricity and fuel both have transport losses and costs in energy.  Getting the energy to the vehicle, fuel has less loss surprisingly. For example the tesla roadsters has a 14% loss just in charging and discharging the battery.

Emissions due to infrastructure installation¬†could be less¬†if done with electric vehicles. Chargers can be installed in hours with no need for the construction costs of huge gas stations. They will be everywhere; in businesses, at every store, at people's homes¬†etc. Thus, less people will need to¬†drive to gas stations which equals less¬†emissions.¬†There will be less truckers that transport gas which equals less emissions. All other trucking will be done with electric big rigs..again less emissions. Less oil will be needed so fracking and the oil refinement process will be a thing of the past. The process of oil transportation will also be a thing of the past. The¬†near end¬†of those processes means a¬†huge¬†amount of carbon is eliminated from the atmosphere. EV infrastructure does not need the level of maintenance that gas stations need, and they also do not need weekly refills of gas. Electricity does not ONLY have to be produced using coal. You can make electricity using¬†water hydrolysis, solar, wind etc which will be stored by¬†quickly advancing battery technology. Battery technology improvements will also make traveling farther on a single charge possible which means less emissions. Battery technology also improves odds for electric planes and shipping to be possible. Renewables contributing to the power grid can¬†accommodate for some of the increase in demand to the power grid. For example, If I have a solar panel on my roof, then I can charge my¬†car without taking power from the¬†grid.¬†¬†That power¬†can also be put¬†back into the grid if need be.¬†The long term savings in carbon emissions more than accounts for the temporary carbon emissions associated with infrastructure set up.

China is investing like nobody's business in renewables for instance, and where many in the US, Australia and the EU would get around in cars many Chinese people travel by electric bike, often home built from cheap kits that are readily available there since they're cheaper than cars and less prone to congestion. India is a major player in developing thorium reactors, which while they have their own issues they're much better than other fission reactors as mentioned and so would be excellent alternatives to fossil fuels.

For instance in a lot of circumstances deploying solar is cheaper than deploying coal power plants, and that's before buying the coal!

Lithium is mined in significant amounts only in a few places, while whole rivers of oil are being pumped daily. I don't think anyone here really understands how much oil we actually consume, and what a scarcity disaster would follow if a significant percentage of internal combustion cars were to be replaced with lithium battery ones. Right now the electric cars are a curiosity and the world's supply of lithium is already stretched to the limits. Li-ion batteries simply can't serve as a substitute for oil, because there's enough oil to run all our cars, and there's not nearly enough lithium to replace it. Even if there were enough lithium, such extreme demand would make it a primary strategic resource of the kind petroleum is now, with political consequences. None of this would be an issue if graphene supercapacitors or some other technology was used for energy storage in cars. Also, the problem of range and charging speed remains an unsolved problem with electric cars; fast charging means lots of amps going through conduits, and this means increased probability of fire. Battery swap is unlikely to become a thing because a battery is a primary component of the vehicle, like engine in the internal combustion ones, and one is unlikely to just swap his new battery for something unknown at a charging station.

Also maybe im miss interpreting what you and Jason said , but if you exclude the emissions from the battery from the analysis doesn't that benefit the electric car heavily?  leaving out the battery to an electric car is like leaving out the engine on an ICE vehicle.  It doesn't work without it. Its not an independent variable it has to be in there. So idk why one would bother with using figures that left the battery out. And even if the EV numbers are inflated it probably doesn't remotely come close to how inflated the ICE numbers are inflated due to including full size trucks , vans , SUVs and industrial vehicles in the average. And in my original comment i said i think electric cars would still beat out ICE vehicles but only in very green states with lots of renewable energy and the time it takes to make up for CO2 production would be very much extended to what amount i cant say. Basically if you corrected all the number while including the batteries it would greatly narrow the margins. For reference Truck , Van , SUV sales make up 65.4% of auto sale in the US. that leaves 35% of sales for crossovers and cars of all kinds combined.  So if your averaging the emissions for the average ICE vehicle sold the emissions are going to be incredibly high. compared to if you had the average from only ICE cars and crossovers.
