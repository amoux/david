Manufacturer service center said AWD should not be impacted but didn't want the risk on a vehicle only a year old.\n\nI ended up ordering a new shaved tire from tire rack.  Simply measure your tires left on vehicle, call up their customer service, and order the tire in the depth you need.

Have you ever had a cracked windshield, its rare because the windshield is usually high enough to where debrees dont hit it but in lower cars and sometimes taller suvs they can break from the smallest of pebbles!

Next time you're near a Lexus or any of the new cars with large grills see if you can locate the adaptive cruise sensor plate or the front camera for the 360 degree camera system or the lane keeping sensors or the parking sensors.  If the grill is done right you won't be able to locate most of those.  Even if the particular car doesn't have the features they make all the grills the same so it won't be so easy to tell one from another.  Low profile tires are not always a bad thing when done right I have 20s on my car and it rides just as good as stock.  Everyone that gets in my car says it rides smooth.

Ground suckers: I expect, when parked, the Lexus sticks out a large tongue and licks the rear of the Chevy in front of it.Ôªø", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Thomas Darby"}

A car with a huge mid section grill has safety concerns as it could cave in a lot more as compared to conventional design where there is fluidity of the bumper in the mid area. I wonder how they have an effective crumple zone as well when they do this and air bag sensor placement may not be as effective then .Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "War X Fit"}

I live in Cornwall which is a very popular tourist and retirement location, which is fine except they all drive either hire cars or the big 4x4s. Now on the main roads that's not really an issue, but as soon as you go off the beaten track you're screwed. Every local who doesn't work in agriculture or fishing will tell you to get a hatchback as they can easily get down those narrow lanes, as most of them have pull ins to let other cars pass, especially if you're willing to accept the odd small scratch here or there. However with the large SUVs that's borderline impossible, especially if they don't want to get too near to the hedgerows. It's even worse with hire cars as they clearly don't want to scratch them at all. But to top it all off I've driven SUVs myself and they're about as exciting to drive as watching paint dry. I love my little Ford it's just so peppy and fun to drive. Plus all the parts are so cheap and easy to replace it's unbelievable.

{"cid": "Ugwtv5VYZ73QqpanUUp4AaABAg", "text": "The main problem I have with modern, computer managed engines is that while they operate very efficiently and produce low emissions when they are new and all their components and sensors are functioning properly, when a component goes bad, the OBD2 system is piss poor at identifying the failed component, many times doesn't even recognize that the engine isn't operating properly, and, in some cases, the computer's corrections to poor emissions exacerbate the problem.  OBD2 came out in '96 IIRC and is still the standard today.  It is disgraceful that the industry is still running firmware rooted in a 33 year old standard.\n\nFirst off, manufacturers should provide USB test ports or bluetooth conectivity on their Engine Control, Brake Control, and Transmission Control Modules so that they can be fully tested using a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.\n\nSecondly, manufacturers should be required to make software or apps to test these modules available for free.\n\nThird, manufacturers should be required to make all factory service manuals and technical bulletins available online for free.\n\nFourth, all model years of a manufacturer's vehicles should be graded on their emissions every year.  In states like CA where vehicles must undergo smog testing every two years, the state should make aggregated test results available to the pubic and should include failed tests in the results.  For example, one might look up the test results for a 1997 Ford Mustang equipped with a 4.6L V8 and see what percentage of such vehicles passed smog testing and what their average emissions were each test year.  This would give the state, car buyers, and manufacturers valuable feedback on how well these engines, their control modules, and the various sensors were designed and built.\n\nMy thought is that a modern, computer controlled, fuel injected engine has very low emissions when new, but as it ages, certain sensors and components begin to wear and develop errors that are within the allowable thresholds of error for the ECM and do not cause a check engine light, but do allow increased emissions and possibly even a poorly running engine.\n\nFifth, the standards for vehicle emissions controls need to be revised.  I'm not sure to what extent manufacturers have improved their improved their engine management approaches over the years because I'm still driving a '97 Mustang.  I find it particularly disturbing that each four-cylinder bank of my V8 relies on one oxygen sensor upstream of the Cat to determine if the computer should lean or enrich the A/F mixture to that bank of cylinders.  Suppose one of those four cylinders has a partially clogged fuel injector and the other three cylinders are operating perfectly.  The computer detects that the bank is running lean and richens the A/F mixture to all four cylinders.  Now I'll have three cylinders all running a bit too rich and the bad cylinder still running lean.  This results in much higher hydrocarbon emissions that the cat has to burn off, will damage the cat more than before the \"correction\" made to the A/F mixture, may result in more tailpipe emissions, and results in the engine running worse and decreased MPG.  Similarly, if the bad cylinder had a loss of spark due to a fouled plug, a bad plug wire, or a bad coil, the computer will errantly enrichen the A/F ratio with the same results.  The obvious solution is that the A/F ratio should be controlled individually for each cylinder.\n\nThe downside is that now the car has to be built with a header that has an O2 sensor on each downpipe and the PCM has to run eight channels of A/F ratio control instead of two channels.  This will increase vehicle cost for the extra O2 sensors, wiring, the more complex PCM, and the header.  It may also pose packaging problems to fit in the headers.\n\nThe upside is that if one cylinder has a problem, it is more easily detected and reported, the computer can effect a correction on only the bad cylinder(s), and the problem can be more easily diagnosed and corrected resulting in fuel savings, a better running engine, less damage to the Cat, and lower tailpipe emissions.  That is a tradeoff that I, as a consumer would be happy to accept.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Jeffrey Johnson"}

At night you can not see them when you pass under a green light in a sweeping right and the poles have no reflectors and many are chewed off from people striking them yet these morons still install them. , sorry for my rant.

This will continue until the day arrives for Self Driving Machines that will eliminate drivers on a large scale.  Every other junk running around is an SUV(Sport Utility Vehicle) that only 10% of the motoring public will ever use.  For those of you that don't know what a 'Station Wagon' was, here is a simple explanation: It was a Passenger Vehicle with an extended Roof Line creating large storage area.  They were known as 2 & 3 Seat Wagons that folded down when 9 passenger seating was not in use.\n\n90% of today's  motoring public does not know what is a real car.  SUV's, Pick Up Trucks and massive Suburbans is what the public currently believes are beautiful cars. How pathetic.  \nThe only reason that Front/Wheel Drive cars were made was to increase the Manufacturers Net Profit per vehicle.  A FWD vehicle has a Production Cost of 40% less and a Rear/Wheel Drive vehicle.  The All Wheel Drive was developed to offset the dangers of FWD vehicles on slippery road surfaces.  These junks are not better than 4 Wheel Drive, but they cost 35% less to produce.\n\nEverything produced today is to benefit the manufacturers' bottom line profit, however in order to achieve this reality it is necessary to dupe the masses about how great their junks are.  I have chosen to avoid discussing technical characteristics for obvious reasons. For those of you that do not have any automobile experience in the following categories, you cannot grasp the truth and reality:  Automotive Design and Engineering, Sales, Advertising, Automotive Mechanics and Excellent Driving Skills.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "BSA 650"}

It may be bright up front, but\n the taillights are off. I always thought this was so stupid. \n\n- Like you said, the lack of a spare tire, some cars provide just a can with a substance \nthat is supposed to plug the hole in the flat tire. What if that tire \nhas a huge gash or a blowout? \n\n-Lack of a dipstick/filler tube for the transmission on most modern cars, making oil changes more difficult. \n\n- Lack of of a dipstick for something as basic as checking the engine oil.\n\n- TOO MANY PLASTIC PARTS\n\n-Some luxury cars /SUVs don't have a mechanical handle to open the \ntailgate. They rely on a sensor that you put your finger over to open \nit.\n\n-Uncomfortable ride compared to large cars from the 70's to the early 90's. \n\n- I don't want to go thru a menu and a touchscreen  just \nto change the volume or the temperature of the cabin. Switches and knobs\n do a better job at this. \n\n-A question for Ford: Why did you get rid of the Crown Victoria? Why did you get rid of the Econoline? \n\n-This one is not as important but still matters: Lack of style. Today's \ncars are so bland, there are some exceptions like the Ford Mustang, \nDodge Challenger and the Chrysler 300.

Yes, German, Swedish and British imports are more expensive than other vehicles to buy, as well as service in the long run.  But they are simply not as troublesome as you describe uniformly.  Yes, there are duds, but there are vehicles which go a long, long while without failures.  And BMW is not the only manufacturer that supplies as standard equipment low profile tires and expensive wheels.  In 50 years of driving I've destroyed one tire on a pothole with its corresponding wheel, and the tire was paid for over 95% by its warranty.  Scotty, you do give excellent advice, but not everyone wants to drive a 10-12 year old car simply because it's inexpensive.  I'd rather have the surety of knowing the airbags will work (they don't consistently work after a decade or more) and I really do appreciate automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, front and rear cross traffic warnings,  lane maintenance and several other features which really make me a better driver and those around me even safer, as well.

Sure, people can load them up with a lot of junk, but there are better vehicles for that. Compared to regular vehicles, SUVs use more fuel, they cost more to fix, most are too big to fit into regular parking bays, so the owners frequently obnoxiously take up more than one bay.\nIn Australia, there are a lot of people doing illegal vehicle modifications. Such as illegally \"upgrading\" their headlight bulbs to ultra-bright halogen bulbs (or those lights that emit various different colours), illegally adding other coloured lights, putting air foils on the back of their cars etc. or using those death spike bike racks on the back of their cars -the kind that could kill a person. They also block their license plate & rear light assembly. They're illegal to use, but people can still buy them. The same for those upright bars that attach to the front bull bar, so people can carry long poles or tubing on their roof. They're illegal too, but even some hire vehicles have them.Ôªø", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "jublywubly"}

I still hope for the return to wire throttle cables, manual transmissions, manual parking brakes, manual window winders and wind wings.

Those were the days, when cars looked like cars, and were easy to work on. I rebuilt my first engine at age 12. A 200ci Ford straight six in a 1964 Fairlane. New cars are a nightmare to work on. People complain about how unreliable those old cars were. But we have reached the point where all the new computer technology on new cars makes them just as unreliable, if not more. I have a 2013 Chevy Sonic I bought about a year and a half ago, and have put 40,000 miles on. I have been working on it since I bought it. Every time I fix one thing, something else goes wrong. The check engine light is on again, I traced it to a bad thermostat. $80 for a new one, and you have to tear the whole top off the engine to get too it. \n\nTo me by far the worst trend on newer cars is those huge wheels and tires with 1\" sidewalls. Those came straight from the GHETTO. Cars with wheels like that are called donks. I wanted to buy a used late model Camaro, Mustang, or Challenger, but you can't get one without those donk wheels, so I gave up on that idea. I think I'll get a standard cab 2 door pickup, if I can find one. That is probably my next biggest issue. 4 door trucks. Those, and Crossovers are the dumbest, ugliest vehicles ever. I grew up with pickups on farms. Real pickups. 2 doors and an 8' bed. It gets really bad when someone takes one of those monstrosities and puts 30\" GHETTO wheels on it. And yes, those huge grilles are hideous. GM ruined the new Camaro by putting those ugly things on it.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Curtis Sherwood"}

What ever happened to 5 mph bumpers, which I had a chance to test out in my 1995 Corolla, when I bumped into the back of a Mercury Sable, no damage done. If that happened in our new Camry, that big goofy grill would have shattered and so would my insurance rates.

My thought is that the popularity of the SUV is related to making carz too low, the population (car buying pop that is) is getting older and our joints are stiffer and SUVs are easier to get in and out, and sitting up rather than laying down is a more comfortable riding position.  Another factoid is these gobermint Aholes are always concerned about gaz mileage, they'd have us riding golf carts given the chance, don't consider that we share roads with really BIG trucks, they scare me, and I want some metal around me when I'm on the road.

If you have 4WD/AWD and need a \"new\" tire, you do not have to replace all 4.  You can either get a used (but still recent manufacture year) tire with the same wear (can measure the inflated diameter) or you can get a new tire and have it shaved down to match, which usually costs about $25... or combine the two, get a used tire so it's cheaper and you're going to shave it down a bit more anyway so you don't miss the lost tread from being a used tire at all.  One last thing, if you nave normal mileage tires, don't replace any with those high silicone, high mileage tires as they will literally wear down half as fast to eventually become a different diameter, and you'll also have inferior, imbalanced traction (most relevant when braking) on that wheel.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Stinky Cheese"}

Maybe those numbers will slow down but I doubt it, I seen a few and it looks alright I suppose.   There's an association with larger vehicles be relevant to their owners own insecurities, ignorance, or just attitudes.  Dickinson, League City, and Texas City are pretty guilty of those assertions.  All I see here is lifted pickups with underglow led's, with giant low profile wheels and shiny suspension components meant for show rather than practicality.  \n\nWhatever floats their owners boats I suppose.  so long as they don't drive like complete idiots and purposely take up 2 parking spaces.  Oh wait......... \n\nRegardless Consumerism is showing that they're asking for SUV versions of everything.  The manufacturers are only giving what the consumers think or believe they need or want.  I don't believe some of the manufacturers REALLY want to make SUV's, like the Cayenne/Macan/F-Pace but all the little princesses/princes think they do. \n\nYou mentioned the URUS. In an interview with CNBC, Lamborghini CEO, Stefano Domenicali, said that sales and orders for the Lamborghini Urus, which starts at $200,000 but usually sells for $240,000 or more with options, have been \"terrific.\"\n\n\"We were expecting a positive feedback from the customer, but not at the level we are receiving now,\" he said. \"The reaction of the customer is really fantastic.\"\n\nSpecifically, he said the company will end 2018 with total production of around 5,000 cars ‚Äì more than 1,000 of which will be the Urus. By the end of 2019, Lambo will be producing around 8,000 cars ‚Äì with more than half being the SUV.\n\nHe said 70 percent of buyers of the Urus are new to the brand, meaning they have never owned a Lambo before. He said he is also surprised by how many of the buyers are women.\n\n\"We have seen an increase in female buyers for sure,\" Domenicali said.\n\nI hate the trend too Scotty, and though Ferrari said they never would, well, Lambo said the same thing.

But you have to own an SUV or CUV to truly appreciate them and understand why they are popular. Especially if you have an active family lifestyle. Now I am not talking about monstrosities like Chevy Tahoe and Ford Expeditions, but one in the range of say a Honda HR-V to a Honda Pilot. I can tell you growing up, 80% of the cars my family owned were minivans and SUVs mostly. Even when gas prices went up in 2005 we simply downsized from a midsized body-on-frame Pathfinder to a compact unibody Grand Vitara. I learned to drive in SUVs and even my wife, who grew up in a country where the Ford EcoSport is virtually an Expedition here in terms of size, refuses to go with anything less than a CUV. Once you own one, the practicality, interior comfort, and peace of mind when driving in the snow is unmatched. I agree, I don't see SUVs going away. And it says alot when even Lamborghini, Bentley, and Rolls Royce are doing it. Even EV manufacturers are producing electrified SUVs. Rivian which is a widely talked about EV company like Tesla once was, their two launch models is an SUV and a pickup truck. GAC Motors, a Chinese car company is launching their GS8 which is a mid-sized 3-row crossover. The trend I don't understand are pickup trucks. I can understand them if you tow alot or actually use it for what its meant for like cargo, but people that just own them just because.

Every car maker is obsessed with slapping I-pads all over the dashboard. I get it, you can type destinations faster and browse menus quickly, but do you really need a touch display for the climate control?! \nThe problem with a touch display is that you need to look at what function you are trying to touch. So you take your eyes off the road. My W211 E420 Mercedes has over 60 buttons throughout the dashboard and I know the placement of every one of those. I can change radio stations, answer a call, call someone, or adjust driving modes, or the climate control without looking at any of those things, because I can feel the buttons. \nThe other problem with these dumb screens is that they produce too much light at night. Sure, they have a \"night\" mode, where it's dimmer and the colors are darker, but that thing still has a backlight that is shining right at your face. And if you have to drive through the night, it's a lot of unnecessary strain on your eyes.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Megadriver"}

Many vehicles put some or all of the controls on the touchscreen menus, taking your eyes off the road for much more time unnecessarily.  Many manufacturers even split up some of the controls between knobs and the touchscreen.  Now this would make sense if all the commonly-used controls were knobs and the less-commonly-used ones were on the touchscreen menus like the heated/cooled seats.  But many haphazardly split up the controls like having a physical button for defrost, but having to access the menu to change to lower or bi-level airflow.  To me, that is too much work to do what used to be easy, it's not even more convenient, and is more likely to break!

But the once since 2014 or 2015 are so ugly I cannot imagine buying any of them. Now Honda has messed up the Civic as well. They have to learn that taking styling cues from the Lamborghini Aventador is not a good idea. Especially with all those dummy inserts that make drag worse. \n\nAnd don't start me on the skinny tires. There is no reason whatsoever for a normal car to have tires lower than a 60 series. Yet I am seeing 55 and 50 series, sometimes 45 series as standard equipment. Skinny tires should be left as an aftermarket item. \n\nIf I do get a new car, I expect to have to a lot of bargaining to get the dealer to swap the rims and tires for 60 or 65 series. I looked at the Honda Fit and the base model has 65 series but the trim level I want has 55 series. \n\nAnother thing I hate on the CUVs is phony skid plates which are often just paint. CUVs are not for serious off road use and the few who will use it for that can get an aftermarket one. I would want one that looks a lot friendlier like the old Rav4 or CRV.\n\nWhen I do need to eventually go to buy a car, I maybe have to find a 2013 or earlier Toyouta or Lexus. Maybe a 2013 Lexus CT200H. I am not too worried about the battery any more after talking to taxi drivers here in Vancouver who use all types of Prius models. They get 500,000 kilometers on the batteries, replacing them at that distance whether the care needs it or not. They they scrap them at 1,000,000 kilometers. I can live with a hybrid that goes 500,000 km on the battery. It will outlast me.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "DM Fraser"}

Fake exhaust pipes are awful I agree and the point about Tesla is a massive hate of mine, it‚Äôs not safe at all. Fake engine sounds aren‚Äôt a big issue, they can‚Äôt usually be turned off and it‚Äôs pretty natural to remove the rattle sound of the engine, this is more so with the downsizing of engines. Electronic parking brakes are amazing aswell, especially for a manual car you simply put the car in gear and drive, once you stop take the car out of gear and if you have auto hold it will do that for you aswell so essentially you never have to touch the parking brake button or do anything other than drive and take your car in and out of gear, very simple with hill starts aswell, pretty much very VW has this now if not all and it‚Äôs something I must have! BMW will have it on all cars soon aswell once they release the new 1 series and other vehicles such as the 4 series. It‚Äôs simpler and safer because your car won‚Äôt roll and you can‚Äôt forget to put it on if you have auto hold for example. Cars with keyless entry always have a back up, in fact most cars with keyless entry usually have it as an option anyway so they have the normal ways but usually on the drivers for handle a part snaps off where there is a manual key hole.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Chatta290"}

Had to watch a video online on Youtube ( special thx to Mr @KmanAuto)  to understand how to even get to the battery cuz with Tesla , you need to have some sort of battery left to get access to the trunks ( which my friend didn‚Äôt) , and the way they make those units make it so much harder to find the battery and all ( it‚Äôs not the typical conventional design we all have ) . \n\nSo all in all, I did really enjoy the elaborated & filled with details response that you gave above . Thx u very much for that. Always fun to discuss with folks online about cars and all that . But note that I did mention that I only dislike those FEW keyless units that didn‚Äôt provide any backup way to get in the car with no battery life left at all . And that not all of them do that, many do provide a backup key accessÔªø", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Daniel Tran"}

Most cars will have these new parking brakes now though so I guess soon it‚Äôs on lying used cars that will have them, keyless entry in the UK is only really standard on cars such as the 7 series, not even the A8 or S Class have it, it‚Äôs not too popular because it‚Äôs a waste of money to pay for really.

Long story short, it already costs thousands of dollars. In 2012 I got cut off by a ricer looking honda civic, I slammed my brakes and I managed to avoid read ending the civic that cut me off. The car behind me, some older ratchet looking car, probably didn't have the best of brakes, didn't manage to stop in time and rear ended my bumper. His license plate was embedded into my bumper, there was a cut and a few minor points of impact. We exchanged insurance information (NY state) and filled a police report, and instead of heading to my scheduled psychology class I went back home. Days later and 2 quotes from two body shops we were awarded 1600$ from their insurance company. This was maybe 50% or so of what that 2006 nissan altima was worth, so obviously instead of having the insurance company pay the body shop we cashed out on the sum towards a new car.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "mad0uche"}

One other trend I hate about new cars is the touch screens on dashboards. You have to take your eyes off the road for too long to operate them and they are just a distraction. Even if you have loads of buttons, if you own a car you get to memorise where they are so you can find them without looking. One other trend that affects us here in Europe more than North America is to fit tiny engines with turbos. The fuel consumption is never as good as the official figures because to drive at a decent speed you need to make use of the boost a lot. So far only Mazda seem to be bucking this trend.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Mark McMarkface"}

Any idea where to start diagnosing strange engine behaviour. The car starts like a treat but the problem is that when accelerating from 3k rpm it looses power and it is by no means smooth. Sometimes it goes well but sometimes it does that. Usually when being pushed from the start it goes ok. But when i suddenly step on it at around 3000rpm it lags and not pulls well. Oh and i put my gopro on the back and it seem so make a black smoke cloud roughly at that time. Should I start with plugs or go straight to cleaning the EGR?

Ironically, I already knew and practiced this. However, I must say the pros outweigh the cons as I absolutely love that I never have to take the fob out of my pocket. I don't know if all manufacturers offer the following features but with my Nissan you can unlock the door by pressing a tiny button on the door handle which is much more convenient than one may realize if never had that \"luxury\", same goes for not having to use a key to start it. Also, it is impossible to lock the fob (the keys) in the car as it unlocks immediately if you close a locked door and the fob is in the car for some reason and the car makes rapid high pitch beeps at you to let you know. I can leave the car running with the doors locked on hot days (gets 90's+ in the Summer and below freezing in Winters where I live) when I run into the gas station so my car stays cool or warm, my fuel door is electronic and always remains locked unless the doors are unlocked, which I'm sure some of you have had to reopen your door and pop the fuel door after having already gotten out of the car or after running into paying for gas, but with mine you just press the button on the door handle and then the fuel door becomes unlocked and it is opened by pushing on the fuel door, not pulling. The fob allows me to roll my windows down to cool the car down if it's been in the sun which helps immensely. However, for $100 I added a plug n play auto start via a t harness to the obd2 so I rarely use that feature now and I get in an ice cold car. I love it tbh. But like I said there are good arguements to be made against it like cost of replacement, theft, more things that could break, etc. No issues for me so far.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "J R"}

It costs almost nothing to make such a setup, and the security on the electronic side for cars is pretty crap.\n\nAs for cloning it, they can still clone it without you pressing unlock.

However, I live in a suburb of St. Louis which isn't necessarily a safe city (often #1 murders in the U.S. and top 5 for sometime) and to the best of my knowledge this sort of skimming theft is rare. The tiny button on the exterior door handle is also a safe guard against the skimming but I highly doubt many are using it for that feature and I doubt dealers tell buyers to use it that way. Unless someone knows differently because in order to use that feature the fob is \"sensing\" you next to the car but the actually button is electronic so... can that be skimmed the same way??? I'm unsure. Also, if ever you're ever attempted to be car jacked you can just turn the car off via the push button on the dash, get out and say here's the keys buddy as you throw the fob on top of the gas station, into the bushes, or just simply away from YOU, etc.Ôªø", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "J R"}

Picture, if you will, sitting in a car park waiting for someone, and it's hot. So you run the engine to run the aircon. And so the running lights are also on and you can't turn them off. So you are drawing attention to yourself at a time when being the grey man might be desirable. Another bad trend are chirps, bells and farts from the car computer to tell you you put your keys in the ignition but haven't closed the door, even if you've got the door open for a reason, and you can't shut it off.
