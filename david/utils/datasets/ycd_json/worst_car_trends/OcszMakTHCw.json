{"cid": "Ugzm9ZeLv8JUUID0STt4AaABAg", "text": "THANK YOU ... THANK YOU ... THANK YOU!!! for this great video.\n\nI am in the market to replace my recently totaled 1998 Toyota Corolla and I'll be blunt: I can't stand the new 2014 to 2020 Corollas or pretty much many of the new similar-type cars today and the reason is simple.  The manufacturers are designing into these new cars so many \"added features\" to compensate for designedin problems and creating newer consumer dangers.\n\nI'd buy a new 1998 Toyota Corolla in a heartbeat because:\n\n1. Reliability: The car had most of it's major parts in perfectly fine working and serviceable order after 21 years including the engine (though it burnt and leaked oil after 10 years), the transmission, the A/C and coolant system, the braking system, the exhaust system, all the electronics from the radio to the lights, etc.  I drove it over 206,000 miles without a single major safety issue and likely could have driven it for up to 300,000 miles.  It never left me stranded.\n2.  Visibility: I could see the entire car from the driver's seat simply by a look in the mirror or a slight or fuller turn of my head or body (if I had to back up) and I could see everything and everyone around me.  There were nearly no blindspots, except for the typical right rear corner.\n3.  Simplicity: There were just enough simple and basic \"bells and whistles, buttons and lights\" to make the car easy to use without distracting noises, lights that would cause you to take your eyes off the road, and easily breakable electronics.\n4.  Fixability: The car had mostly easy to access mechanical items when needing to fix either a usual wearable external part or a more challenging internal part.\n5.  Cost of Use: I drove around 12,000 miles to 15,000 miles per year and the car usually cost me very little per year unless a major item needed to be serviced like the timing belt after 100,000 miles.\n6.  Gas Mileage: I could easily get over 300 highway miles on this car, 250 miles around town.\n7.  Paint and Body: The car had lots of chipped paint on the front of the hood from being hit from pebbles on the ground after 21 years, but there wasn't an ounce of rust on the visible body of the car, though of course there was some underneath.  The carpeting and seat covers and seat cushions were all in perfect condition after 21 years.\n\nThe biggest problem I've noticed with these new cars, especially the 2014 to 2020 Corollas is that they are designed to be driven as if you're a fighter pilot in an aerial dog fight.\n\nManufacturers are designing in \"blind spots\" in cars like the thicker front \"A-Columns\" and \"C-Columns\" for the airbags and using smaller windows in the process as if window glass is at a premium.  Because of the EPA's requirements to have maximum gas mileage, the car designers have dropped the hoods and raised the rears of cars to increase aerodynamic performance, which makes figuring out where the front of your car begins and the rear of your car ends a near impossible guess.  Hence, why the added the back-up cameras so you could see what you're backing up into.  (Now, granted, I know the story about the man who sadly and tragically backed up over his son, but think how that accident might have been better avoided has the rear of his car been lower.)  You can't remove the rear headrests from the back seats in the newer Toyota Corollas, so now they immediately use up 15% or more of the visible space of the rear window.  I could be wrong, but it seems like the side mirrors are smaller too.  And last, but certainly not least, there are so many damn \"bells and whistles and lights\" going off from the lane assist detection to the \"Infotainment System\" (which is very hard to use while driving if only to change a radio station) that I believe they are designing in ever more ways to become distracted drivers.  The 2019 Corolla allows for 36 pre-set FM and AM stations.  Who the heck listens to more than a few FM or AM stations while driving, even if you drive long distances between cities and different radio stations?  Oh, and one more thing that just occurred to me.  The size of these cars keeps increasing though they keep managing to make the cars more fuel efficient.  I used to drive a 1985 Camry that was about as big as my 1998 Corolla.  The new 2020 Corollas are about as big as the earlier 2000's Camry's now.  Seriously, do we need such bigger cars even if they are making them more fuel efficient?\n\nLong story short, I miss my Dad's 1964 Dodge Dart and my 1998 Toyota Corolla.  My Dad's Dart was incredibly easy to fix.  And both cars were easy to drive, easy to see around in, got you from point A to B without much fanfare, and cost very little to maintain and drove drove for hundreds of thousands of miles.﻿", "time": "1 week ago (edited)", "author": "Robert Goodman"}

{"cid": "UgzM1mBspPDn8TITiTp4AaABAg", "text": "You know, you're really fucking stupid.. First of all, augmented engine noise exists because modern cars are so much better insulated than they used to be, and combined with muted turbo engines you just wouldn't be able to hear any noise at all which is a big part of the sensation of driving a car. Especially with a manual transmission it is vital to have.\n\n\nSecondly, \"stuck on screens are so ugly and bad and engineers are just lazy\" no you know what, fuck you. The reason they do it is to move the screen as far up into the driver's field of view as possible, and it works awesome and is a lot safer. When manufacturers mould the dash around the screen, everything becomes a lot more bulky than necessary. By not doing that it improves forward visibility and makes you feel less encapsulated in the car. I love it on my car, think it looks great.\n\n\nThird, just because you're an old fart who doesn't understand technology doesn't mean it's all crap. The 3rd gen Ford Focus did not rely on it's infotainment for operating functions in the car, and the result was that the dash was covered in buttons, which looks ugly and is a pain to use. My new 4th gen Focus has moved over half of the buttons of the old car into the Sync 3 system. It's not as excellent as VW's or Mercedes new systems, but it is a hell of a lot better than the old Focus. The entire dashboard is cleaned up as a result, and everything looks and works 10 times better.\n\n\nFourth, you decide the size of wheels you want on your own car you dipshit. Having a car that looks good is important though, if not I'd just buy some crappy Hyundai on 16's and call it a day. My Focus on 18's in Active trim looks awesome, so pleased with it. So it costs a bit more, but it's worth it. And I have adaptive dampers so the ride is smooth as silk.\n\n\nJust because you don't like that car manufacturers aren't stuck in the 80's where you are doesn't mean what they're doing is stupid. Stop acting like you're some kind of authority on this, it's ridiculous how you believe you know better than a multi billion dollar corporation. I love my Ford Focus, and apart from the door handles it is a \"culprit\" of every single point on your list. And thank god for that, it's better than it's predecessor in every single manner because of it. Thank you.﻿", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "torod213"}

After so many decades ago, I still remember the dedication and devotion we gave to that car. It was expensive. I did my first round at around 75 to 80 ...I got her up to a ton. The highest that I ever did was 126. Then I had a crash, thrown out and slid on the grass, my jeans at the hip solidified. I was lucky to survive unscathed.

I was the first among my friends and foes to throw away Carbon Leads and installed solid copper wires. No problem starting in the damp foggy mornings. The biggest problem with modern cars is frivolities that are being pushed that distract the driver.  The other part is not giving the choice of not having them. I don't like Modern Ignition Keys loaded with a lot of unnecessary operations. I remember having two keys:: door and boot / trunk. The big problem with Electronics and Microprocessors is that manufacturers penny pinch and use the cheapest, resulting in short circuits causing big damage. The other big problem is with spare parts especially circuit boards and digital displays, both being very sensitive to Voltage, Heat, Damp and Dust. Due to heavy onslaught of Electronics, repairs cannot be done at ordinary garages. Dealers are blood sucking leeches charging huge sums for doing no work. Another is filling tryes with Nitrogen and charging extra. Ironically the Air we breathe consists of 79% Nitrogen, 29% Oxygen and 1% others.

The fuel economy savings that some people want to claim is the reason for the small 4 cylinder turbo just don't pan out because what happens is people rev on it more to get the power and so it spends more time under heavy acceleration and at higher RPM which it turn actually causes the car to use more gas.

Well that is great if you just get a leak or in Germany where they have a service station every 2 km but here in North America (Canada specifically) there are a lot of long stretches with no towns or service stations so if you bend your rim or blow out your tire somewhere on the Alaska Hwy or some other place where the sign next service 200 km fill up now you are screwed. But going back to the run-flat tire,  where do you get it fixed in some small town or someplace where they don't carry run-flat tires. I know it is just not Mercedes but a lot of car manufacturers are doing this but many other car makers, BMW, Chev, Audi, etc. How many people check to see if there is a spare tire when you are buying a new car? I bet most people just assume that there is a spare in the back somewhere. I believe spares are a safety issue and should be mandatory in cars but it looks like the manufacturers are trying to cheap out by eliminating something that does not get used very often and it saves weight, but do you think that you are paying any less for care because there is no spare?﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "MrBigblue88"}

{"cid": "UgyMXrQf6IiJ7tPemHV4AaABAg", "text": "You fail to properly place blame for a few of these.  Government CAFE mandates have caused the influx of I-4 turbos vs. V6 engines.  On the EPA laboratory cycle, most turbos never spool up and you get a nice EPA CITY/HWY number.  In the real world, people pass, accelerate at intersections and dart through traffic. The turbo then gives the customer the power they want, but the real-world mileage ends up being the same as a V6.   Rear-view cameras were mandated once they seemed like a good idea....problem is now, the manufacturers can build up the back of a car for looks, and no longer worry if someone can see out of the back.  \n\nThe screens being high is a GOOD thing.  Unless you want a mound on your dashboard, it probably is the only good way to get peoples eye level up by the road.  My Jeep had a nice 8 inch screen but you had to look down off the road to use it.   My new Audi has the iPad fused on the dash.  Less eye drop is safer.   \n\nAgree 100% on fake stuff, that is completely 100% the fault of the manufacturers.  Playing devils advocate on the fake engine sounds, some makes sell the same car to two different clientele's.  Take a BMW 3 or an Audi A4.

I'm not a big button pusher, I rarely push a button in my car (audio is on the steering wheel, climate is automatic, rain/light= automatic, I sometimes push the seat warmer I might do that 5 times a year, the only frequent used button is the window defogger) So I rather have a screen with useful information than a wide range of buttons cluttering up my dash.  People calling the screens dangerous are just complete retards, do some research.\nScreens are actually safer as it gives the important information within eyesight and how is a radio with small buttons safer? Some manufactures use to many screens or to big like some did too many buttons . \nSome cars like the bmw i3 have a really big rims size (19 inch,  for the car size) and very thin tires (155,  /70= thin wall), all in the name of economy (essentially streamline too, because they are very narrow but still big in size so they have the same road contact area as a thicker 16 inch 'normal tire', but with less frontal area, maintaining performance also offering a smoother ride.

They may not be aware of it, and they may talk a great game about all the buzzwords and claims, but at the end of the day it influences their decision-making.  \n\nMillions of companies around the world continue to use shitty buzzwords that don't really differentiate them from the competition. They do it because it still works. Human beings are fucking irrational dumbasses who like to tell themselves that they're neither irrational, nor a dumbass.  \n\nAges ago, before I was involved in marketing, I laughed at JC Penny's constant stream of \"sales\"....a new one seemingly every week. Retailers such as Harbor Freight use the same tactic. I questioned why anyone would ever buy JC Penny products at a regular price when they could just wait for a sale. And I reasoned that the sales were a fucking stupid idea and that JC Penny should just permanently lower all of its prices to the \"sale\" price. After all, I reasoned, if people only wait for sale prices anyway, then they ought to be thrilled that everything is now everyday low priced.  \n\nWell, around a decade ago, the new CEO Ron Johnson, did exactly that. He got rid of the sales and moved to everyday low prices. Logical, right? Now you could buy their products at the lower prices any time you like. Well, counterintuitively, it was one of the strategies that permanently fucked JC Penny so deeply that the company never recovered. Why?  Because irrational fucking dickhead human beings love the feeling they get when scoring a sale...even if the fucking sale occurs practically every fucking week anyway. \n\nSo when you tell yourself you're not affected by fucking buzzwords and embellished marketing claims, you're fucking lying to yourself.  I know that for a fact.

Unfortunately for progress to take place we need to do things that go outside of people's comfort zones. We have to move past the days of the pushrod 2v V8 in order to increase fuel mileage and power. Now you can have a v6 that makes double the power that's half the size of a V8 and gets better milage. These new turbo motors are going to be inherently more complicated then the typical pushrod engine of yesterday. But as I said the increase of power and better mileage make the complication worth it to most. To someone like myself I can even attain much more power by doing a simple tune on one of these cars or trucks by increasing boost and modifying the fuel curve. Not saying that you are one of the people that don't get it, just bringing up this point because in my opinion for progress to happen things need to change. When things change they become complicated to many. but, the new generation of gear heads will think the current tech is simple when 50 years down the road cars are being ran with superconductors or who knows what lol﻿", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Andrew  Stevens"}

Car manufacturers are in fact optimizing the vehicle Dynamics for top performance with 18 inch or bigger wheels. Why would you almost imply that they aren't? And it doesn't make it any easier setting up your suspension to have 15 inch wheels. It's just going to change the numbers. Besides the overall wheel diameter can be exactly the same using a 15 inch wheels and larger series tire as using a 19 inch wheels with a lower profile tire. Yes,you may have a harsher ride because you're sidewall is smaller but the profile is exactly the same and you end up with a much better look. This isn't a \"trend\" nor is using turbos.

{"cid": "UgwpNUcgYkVoq8OTWRx4AaABAg", "text": "I agree with most of your gripes, except the turbo complaint.\n@8:25\nYes, just slapping a turbo on what was a naturally aspirated engine is very poor engineering and destined for problems. However, turbos are the future. As a reasonable commuter car, I believe the best overall compromise is a 1.8 to 2.2 liter turbo diesel with electroregenerative braking and boost. Not purely electric, but enough to capture most of the energy that would've otherwise been lost to heat dissipation. The benfi of a turbo, when done right, is to have virtually two engines in one. casual driving is economical, and power is still available when needed, and weight savings from smaller engines. Diesels are economical and torquey little bitches which is great for acceleration in the city and onto the highway, and great for reasonable commuting speeds around 80 miles per hour. Of course gasoline engines have better top end and horsepower, but for the driving I described, a small turbo diesel is far more effective and efficient. The electroregenerative aspect is optional, but would increase efficiency and acceleration, also due to great starting and low end torque inherent to DC motors. I'm not against other cars, and of course I'd love to own a Porsche Carrera GT or 9 series, I just think that with current, proven technologies, a 2 liter turbo diesel power plant is a great choice. \nI've had plenty of vehicles, and 2 very different ones stand out. I had a Fiat Spyder in the 80's and I recently had a supercharged AMG. Looking up the specs for the Spyder I discovered it only had 105 HP. It went exactly 100 mph, with 5th gear at just under yellowline, which around 5700 rpm (don't quote me). I thought is was well engineered and balanced bc it could sit there at that RPM continuous, through a whole tank of gas on the highway, not an RPM wasted, and nothing strained. Fill er up and head out again. It was a little 1.8 liter twin overhead cam carburetor engine, and although built by Fiat, it had some minor Ferrari technology in there, but nothing to really mention. It sounded great, and although it didn't knock your head back, it wasn't slow either, but it was a lot of fun to wind and shift through the gears, especially with the top down. On the other hand, the AMG's acceleration was insane, and the top speed was up there too...I hit the governor at 155 several times, and yet it was planted on the road.  However, that speed is highly unlawful. And that's the thing...I could never really push that car bc within a couple quick seconds, you've accelerated up to the triple digit 'arrest-able speed' numbers. The 'fun' is over almost as soon as it starts, and you have to keep a watchful eye on that speedo. Inadvertently cruising up to 90+ is just too easy. The modestly powered 5 speed manual convertible gave me time to enjoy the wind out and shifts. \nAnyway, most commuter traffic driving is about efficient acceleration and cruising up to around 80 mph, and the 2 liter TD easily beats gas powered cars, IMHO. I think they will become very popular in the US soon.﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Mudder Fukker"}

And finally, LED brake lights that flicker.  Yes, I can see the flickering.  They do this to dim the light because regular LEDs don't dim...they are either on or off.  If you are going to use a duty cycle to \"lower\" the light, please do it at a frequency that I can't see.  It is really noticeable when you dart your eyes...the tail lights look like strobe lights.  If you never noticed this, you're lucky.  Cadillacs are the worst.﻿", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Steve Kruse"}

Or swap it with a 10L engine that's poking out the hood and, again, still be street legal.\nBut in the rest of the world swapping an engine is expensive and exhausting, and not because you buy a high quality engine that needs a lot of modifications done to the car in order to fit, but because of all the trouble you have to go through to actually use that engine legally and also the taxes are basically skyrocketting.\nIt's way better to have a turbo engine and the possibility to remap the engine and squeeze even more HP out of it.\nThe 150HP diesel Golf 4 can go very well up to 220HP with only an ECU remap. And that without any other hardware mod (besides a racing-spec DPF).\n\nInfotainment systems.\nThey would be really good if they were made properly.\nAnd by that i mean to be using Android and Android only.\nNo more laggy proprietary OSs and no more highly outdated Windows CE.\nA friend has an Android tablet instead of a radio in his Golf 4.\nIt's very useful, it's up to date and it can connect to the OBD2 port to display horsepower, torque, speed, etc., basically a more advanced dashboard.\nAlso, you can split screen Waze and Spotify, something you simply cannot do on an OEM infotainment.\nPlus, you can use your preferred brand of rear view cameras.\n\nEdit: My personal problem with cars nowadays is how automated they are, but how simple things were automated the wrong way.\nParking brakes, start&stop, assists literally everywhere, etc.\nYou can't even roll down your windows manually anymore.\nAlso the doors who get stuck in 3 pre-defined positions and you literally have to fight the door to keep it from hitting you or hitting the car next to you.\nAlso the visibility decreased over the years.﻿", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Myrmeko Me"}

Look at the smartphones today: they are so similar to each other in design and overall look. Standardization is not always good.\nSFMBE.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Nick Flames"}

What's wrong with packing more into the screen? One of the examples you used was an equalizer built-in. That's fucking awesome. Not just that, but all the other \"extra\" features. *They're only a net positive*. All the basic features that you're making a case for to go back to the \"good old days\", they're still there, and I'm willing to bet 99% of the time they're within one screen from the home screen. If you personally don't need any of the extra features, then that's fine, but making a case that it's too complex is such a older generation mentality. \"I don't get it and I don't need it, therefore it's unnecessary, we didn't need it before so why do we now\". And for those who are about to say \"they're so unnecessary\", well then by that logic so is everything else we have in modern cars, like radio. Most of these features aren't even meant to be adjusted by the driver while driving, and all the necessary ones (like volume and temperature control) are usually on the home screen anyway.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Mikozee"}

{"cid": "Ugxhxme5D27Rh6uSsWZ4AaABAg", "text": "The worst trend in modern technology is that devices are no longer our tools, but we become rather a tool of the devices. They think for us instead of helping us to think. They make life more comfortable but at the same time we cannot use that added spare time wisely anyway, being a lazy biological creature as we are. And without them we cannot do anything since we enslave us to our tools. Even more in future. And the worst thing is that most people don't even understand how these technologies do work thus being even more vulnerable to the disadvantages I mentioned. Also, we become more pure users of devices but not the owners. The ownership is still with the manufacturers and they define what we are allowed or not allowed to do with their devices. Some people say that tablets and smartphones will make clobby computers obsolete. Try programming on an iPad then. No way to compile code in an arbitrary programming language and execute the program. You are not allowed to do so and that's not because the device wouldn't be able to do that.\n\nFor cars particularly I don't like the shift to touch screens. I don't like touch screens in computers and mobile devices neither. With haptic feedback I can type blindly, I can turn on the car's heater or light. My brains knows where to reach and how far I have to turn. But with a touch screen I will have to look away from the traffic only to go through the menu to do the simple task. Beside that I am a fan of knobs and \"complexity\". I don't like that clinic tidiness of technology where all the magic disappears behind an empty facade. No Apple, technology is not on it's best when it simply disappears.

The proximity sensor (RFID?) already unlocks the driver and passenger side doors so where is the safety issue?  But when my hands are full and I would like to throw my stuff (usually laptop, etc) in the back seat, I have to find the fob and hit the button a couple of times to unlock the back doors.  On both my Honda and Toyota, you can program just about every other aspect of the locking system from what speed it locks the doors, to whether it unlocks when you put it in P or turn off the key, etc. but you can't defeat this \"personal safety\" feature that as far as I can tell provides no personal safety.\n\nSmart keys that aren't very smart.

While I'm relatively certain that was the origin of doing it that way, I'm actually growing more towards liking that system.  I would say it goes right along with the too much tech issue.  System settings for the radio, nav, environment systems buried in a touch screen menu system get out of hand.\n\nBut the problem multiplies when you need a bigger screen to show more information/controls and remove physical buttons for the A/C or radio controls.  What happens with non standardized tech and a bigger screen?  The air vents get pushed around.  With a big screen in the middle, the air vents often get pushed to the side and are blowing on your hands instead of into the environment of the vehicle.  Having a Stuck On Screen means that historically standard physical controls, and air vents remain where they should.  As a person who works in construction, I understand the need for how any HVAC system needs air flow to balance an interior environment in a home or office building.\n\nStuck On Screens are not near as attractive as dash mounted infotainment screens, but they usually allow the rest of the system to be more user friendly and functional.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Dennis Ristow"}

{"cid": "UgyKoB4BknyVDAvFOmF4AaABAg", "text": "Read some of the comments... and I gotta say, good job video maker for actually choosing items that made sense as to why they're useless/whatever... As for what I'm reading in alot of the comments... its just alot of personal taste and opinions... Like the people who constantly say \"A truck is for work, not for someone to drive\" when... yea, its a Truck. Its meant to be DRIVEN... It can be used to haul, and to toe, but its main purpose is to be DRIVEN... it is a MOTOR VEHICLE... If you have the 100k to spend on a tricked out truck, then more power to ya. Just don't be an idiot with it. If you use it to haul things or toe things/for work, then again, more power to ya. You can tow just as much with a TDI Jetta as you would with most trucks that people tend to buy. So why not label that as a 'work vehicle to'? Just doesn't make sense. Let people drive what they want to drive. Its an aesthetic choice. You want something big and powerful looking that can also do some work if ya want to, then you get a truck. If you don't care much about having that 'big powerful' look, you get a car. Simple as that. \n\nThen I see people complaining about the huge touch screens. Sure, sometimes they're garbage. But you know why they're garbage? Its the processor built into the car. Not the screen. Most of those screens would actually be SUPER AMAZING if they didn't take 50 minutes to go from one screen to the next. And that's allllll thanks to the stupid slow processors in them. Look out for 2019, as Samsung is releasing processors for cars that are just as powerful as their smart phones... So imagine having a display in the car that DOESN'T lag and stutter every time you need to use it!\n\nAnd finally as a remark to the actual video... Honestly, I'd love to see a car that had zero windows, and instead had super amazingly powerful cameras and displays.... You could completely change how the car looks, and redesign the occupant placement... You could make the thing SUPER INSANELY SAFE.... 60mph crashes with ZERO injuries even.... Ontop of that, these cameras could have IR cameras, allowing you to see perfectly clear in the dark without being blinded by other drivers or blinding other drivers yourself. And because it would be using IR, it then could also detect thermal instances. Aka, you could see a deer or animal on the side of the road MILES (literally) ahead of you! It'd also make autonomous driving even better and safer... I can not see a single downside to such a thing other than \"oh well what if a camera breaks? what if the screen breaks? what if the power goes off?\" in which i'd say \"What if your windshield shatters? What if your windshield shatters? What if your headlights go out?\" There isn't anything that wouldn't have an equivalent situation with a Windshield.... If it shatters, you can't see out of it... if you push it away, now you cant' see because of the wind/glass shards destroying your eyes. If your headlight goes out, welp you can't see.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Hikari"}

I go to Colorado every summer and had no problem going 80 miles an hour over Vail pass.  In fact, I was passing a lot of others.  They also dinged its reliability.  You cannot put a 10 year 100 thousand mile warranty on the drive train, a 7 year 70 thousand mile warranty on rust through or a 6 year 50 thousand bumper to bumper warranty on a car that is unreliable.

But overtime it will build up carbon deposit on the back of the inlet valves, which leads to lower power, lower efficiency, much higher emission than non DI engine, and rough running engine as well. The maintenance cost is much higher than non DI engines. That’s why Toyota has resisted the urge to introduce DI only engines for their popular models. DI is partially the response to the ever stringent emission regulation, and marketing: a very sorry story because it actually cause more emission over the life time of the cars with DI, all things considered.﻿", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "A C"}

Keep a weather app on my phone and a 20 second check of the forecast every morning dictates which car leaves the garage for work. I can almost see your point if you're referencing SUV's...but Range Rover/ Jaguar SUV's are rarely daily drivers to work. Usually the stay at home mom (or dad) gets the shiny SUV to make the necessary runs to school/ practices while the working parent takes the less shiny sedan to work. I guess the only exception is if both parents work...but a lot of jobs have parking garages like mine.

I do know plenty of people that have broken or ripped off a traditional handle trying to pull open a door that's frozen shut. If anything a flush handle keeps you from breaking the door because there's nothing to grab and pull on before the car is thawed properly. Sorry for the book here, but any car that has flush handles also has remote start....so it's nice and warm and I can slide the ice right off the car by the time I get to the car in the unlikely event it sat through freezing rain.

Second when you're adding complication (motor units, electronics, ecu) namely on a vehicle like the range Rover velar which is already ridiculously complicated and expensive to repair.  Also as pictured in the video, when the door handle doesn't eject when you walk up to the car like it's supposed to so you sit there and wait for it to come out before you can open it which is absolutely the epitome a functionless design. It has zero function other than a \"cool factor\" namely on an SUV.   If you've ever spent time doing repairs on vehicles working with mechanics or having to deal with troubleshooting half baked software or technology you would have zero tolerance for this type of thing.  It's these types of \"features\" that lead to the over complication and other frustrating design choices implemented in modern cars.

Most, almost all, people that own these cars will never face an issue with these handles other than an unfamiliar passenger not knowing how to process what just happened. But to address your uncommon \"issues\": If you're walking up to the car and the handles don't come out on time, the issue is with the battery in the remote, not the handle. The point that it's more expensive to fix is redundant...it's a luxury car. They're expensive. That's kind of the point and adding a few bucks to cost of repair isn't a big deal to a buyer that 9 times out of 10 isn't going to keep it past its factory warranty anyways. Warranty repairs are free and, for the record, cover you for 5 years/ 60k miles on the Jag/ Range Rovers you mentioned. Also covers routine maintenance (thumbs up emoji). I'm sure you know the dead battery thing is a far stretch because every manufacturer has a fail safe for that. The car doesn't just become a paper weight if the battery dies lol And you speak as if the technology behind moving a bit of metal/ plastic an inch and a half is some groundbreaking piece of tech that must have been bestowed upon us by some advanced alien species. Because that's really the only difference. The tumbler and inner workings of the door latch are all the same, you're just simply moving a bit of metal and or plastic to give you something to grab onto. When compared to the rest of the tech in a luxury brand vehicle...or really any modern car...it's child's play. I feel I've made and defended my point adequately, the hatred for this feature is misguided and from a population that doesn't use it on a daily basis.

I'd love to see legitimate integration here \" Hey google, set the temp to 73\" Never have to take your eyes off the road.\n\nOnto the security concerns:\nThere ARE some legitimate concerns with remote functions becoming more common, however, as far as run of the mill thieves are concerned, cars to this day still have the same software vulnerabilities they've had for over a decade. Getting into a push start car with nothing but patience and a raspberry Pi has been a thing for ten years now. This isn't rocket science, it's probably something a few nights of surfing the right forums could teach you yet we don't hear about that happening on a daily basis. If you're that concerned about tech vulnerabilities buy a pre 96 vehicle that lacks OBD II- it's your safest bet for avoiding software intrusions :)\n\nFollow-up to Security concerns.\nWhy do we all get to pick and choose where to draw the line? While I agree some security issues are things to worry about, I've seen many people complain about them while keeping their prehistoric 8bit garage door opener that can be hacked with a child's toy. Not even touching on the fact that their cell phones typically have BT and Wi-Fi on. Being a security enthusiast is okay. Picking and choosing where you're comfortable with your lack of security is just bias at best and paranoia at least.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Cody Sams"}

Facebook gets all the attention but along with Google they have horrific records when it comes to protecting user data. I really do not need or want Google to decide which temperature my car should be at, I can think and do that for myself. Even more so, if I buy a VW I'm choosing to do business with them, why should Google, a company I didn't want anything to do with when purchasing my car be thrown in there as well?  \nSome things may sound cool, but when you really think about it, they just become an unnecessary annoyance.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "SuperAaron 99"}

From your speakers to your Head Unit, sure it may be a commissioned re-badged/branded product. But Toyota aren't exactly chucking out Head units and speakers in house.\n\nAnd from a real technical standpoint I'd be much happier with an OpenOS kind of thing, potentially android or Linux installed in factory HUs with more access to embedded systems and other MPU related things. That way people could have their choice of Google or Apple. Or custom stuff from home etc. Sad fact is that is way way too technical. Pre-loading it with the industry leading systems (Which for home automation right now is Alexa and Google) lets more people have a device they can understand and use.\n\n\nThat's just on a practicality standpoint. That's not even getting into cost. It's much much cheaper to use Google or Alexa, if not a profit considering licensing deals. Than to make custom software. And with the rate cars are going heavy in all sorts of tech I don't see this very far in the future at all.\n\nThough, again If you're someone who is concerned about privacy and security instead, setting up a VPN with VPS  properly configured to  handle the traffic should be something that is doable.\n\nI think you're talking to the wrong person if you believe these things turn into an annoyance.

{"cid": "Ugx1C4BrF6-RkJoZNs54AaABAg", "text": "Pretty good list.  I selected a few that I find particularly offensive:\n\nAwards - Anyone who buys a car based on  awards is a fool. As you hinted, how can a car be deemed dependable after one or even two years in existence. There is simply no real data to support it. The \"Initial Quality\" award is also a joke. It's based on total individual reported problems within a specified period, not the severity of those issues. My Mazda CX-9  had a broken seat belt retainer clip and a recall of the front door stops to replace them with a version that better held the doors when open. My Honda CR-V experienced a bad fuel gauge sending unit and the gas cap tether broke. According to the parameters of that initial quality award, both those vehicles were rated as twice as bad as those Chevys that killed over 100 people due to ignition failures (if that was the only thing that went wrong). \nAs a side note, this applies to books, also. There are many fake awards out there, but even the \"legitimate\" awards are selected from a very small sample of all the books available for that year and genre.\n\nTouch Screens - These are annoying enough for phones and tablets where you are stationary and can focus on what you're doing. While driving it's a nightmare for everyone to have to shift focus onto a screen and carefully touch a specific spot to activate a function. I don't mind the display screens as long as they are integrated but they need tactile (and varied) controls, and you shouldn't have to re-enact the finale of Inception to change the radio station or turn on the lights.\n\nA few you didn't mention:\n\nUltra-bright headlights. In this age of selfish and/or oblivious drivers who fail to understand the concept of courtesy, this is beyond annoying. I can no longer stand to drive at night because every time I am forced to squint through a wash of white or bluish light flooding the interior from behind or blinding me from ahead.\n\n\"Safety\" Sensors - These are making drivers worse by replacing good driving habits with reliance on these gadgets. They started with those backup sensors that resulted in a rash of cases of children being run over because instead of looking, the driver expected the sensor to warn them of any obstacles. The problem is the delay. If a person is watching (even with a decent back-up camera) and sees a child run behind their car they react instantly to their visual perception. when relying on sensors, those sensors must first detect the child, determine it's an obstacle, and sound an alarm. Only then can the driver react to the sound, and only after they recognize it as the backup alarm. \nMy point is illustrated by the very commercials advertising such features. Watch any \"demonstration\" of a safety sensor in action in an ad and the driver is depicted as being a moron who doesn't pay attention. Exactly how bad a driver must a person be to not see a parade float directly ahead? The latest one that grinds my gears is the one that won't let the doors open if it detects a passing vehicle. First, stop being lazy parents and teach your kids to look and think before they act. Second, what happens when the car won't let you out after a minor crash and it comes to rest on the train tracks, or the tanker truck with which you collided is leaking acetone, or Jason gets up even though you just ran him over?\n\nTap-and-release gear selectors - This may be the stupidest idea for cars in the last forty years. Anton Yelchin famously died because he thought he had pushed the selector of his Jeep into PARK when he actually put it in NEUTRAL, but thousands of other people have also had issues with those selectors which is why they were in the midst of a recall. Those people aren't stupid as some have suggested, but that's extremely unfair (Anton possessed a genius-level IQ).\nThe problem stemmed from them retaining the general shape and placement of the gear shift lever in spite of fundamentally changing the way the gears are selected. It takes very little time for a person to develop a muscle memory of that process whether using a floor- or column-mounted lever, meaning any automatic they drive comes with the subconscious expectation they must move the gear selector in a specific direction to a specific position to change gears, and placing a vehicle in PARK means thrusting it all the way forward or counter-clockwise. Drives don't have issues with push-button or rotary knob gear selectors because they operate in a different way, removing any confusion by requiring the driver to learn a totally new motion. I like the way some new EVs have done it, eliminating the lever and having either separate, large buttons for each drive mode or using a large selectors knob that rotates into different positions rather than being twist-and-release.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Writer B.L.

These emergency braking, automatic cruise control,  stay-in-lane features and Tesla Autopilot are great tech, but they encourage the texters of this world to spend more time texting, and they're already doing it in cars that don't have any of these features. VW commercials for one pretty much promote not looking where you're going as normal driving.\n2] Along with the fake vents, how about ridiculously large grills? Numerous cars in the 90's proved that 1930's-truck size grills aren't needed for air intake and cooling on modern cars, so why the gaping maw on so many of them in the last few years?\n3] No visibility to the rear. Why the continuing trend of enormous C-pillars and small rear windows on so many vehicles? It's bad enough that people don't look where they're driving; why block the view of those who do want to look?\n\nAnd boy do I agree about overly complicated screens. Besides being confusing, they're another reason for drivers invitation to not look at the road, and they're a large source of unreliability in cars when other aspects have become very reliable. \n\nI also agree on oversized wheels. My car has had three(!) flats due to crappy road maintenance (I live in Ohio), and I would have avoided at least two of them with normal sized tires. But if you look at blue-sky concept drawings recently, many of them have even larger wheels and essentially no tires at all. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=concept+car+drawing&lr=&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk9O6yvr_fAhVJ44MKHfv0BScQ_AUIDigB&biw=1920&bih=966﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "AlienBarbers"}

Full-size pickups: we're the only country in the world that insists on them. If you're not in the trades or a farmer/rancher you don't need one. Sadly, compact pickups don't sell and get almost as crappy fuel economy. Unified controls like BMW iDrive and that flat mushroom Toyota uses.

Stylized headlights. Cat's eye headlights simply cannot illuminate as well as bigger rounder lamps. Turbo: ok in the free-horsepower sense but added complication and often are optimized for premium fuel, so where is the saving? No spare tire: WTF? You rip a sidewall and you're done.

The original paint is still nice and so is the interior. Everything still works on this car, and I mean everything. Yes it’s a little slow, and a little big but I can see out of this car so well. I love the room inside and the fact that the dash is not cluttered and everything is manually operated. No real distractions. I learned to not get in a hurry in this car and noticed how much my stress level went down while driving.It doesn’t have the all the electronics that are broken or out of date in a few years. I can repair most of this car myself and the parts are cheap. If it goes in for repair, it is still cheap. I would like electronic fuel injection, but the carb was still one you can tune yourself. And yes it gets only 16 mpg combined, but the cost of repair and parts more than offsets that.  I go everywhere anyone else does. Where will all these new vehicles be in about 40 years and who would want one. If an automaker would come out with a vehicle that went back to the basics and of easy repair, they would sell like hot cakes. I know that new vehicles have to have all these safety devices, easy to replace airbag assemblies would be great. When I look at the inside of the newest vehicles out, looks like the cockpit of a fighter jet. Test drive a well kept older car and see what you have been missing. A whole lot of headache.

How about some cheap cars have turbos? \"Slap a turbo on it.\" Okay, the CHEAP cars, but not the well conceived, designed and produced cars. If not having a turbo and still having 500 FP of torque means spending well over $100K to get a not cheap naturally aspirated engine, then I guess all less expensive high performance cars with turbos are \"cheap\". Well, at least they aren't as expensive; but I wouldn't say that either side of $40K is \"cheap\". If EV take over, they will need to make some kind of noise to keep pedestrians safe; so \"fake engine noise\" tech seems the obvious way to go.

Those things and other conveniences are, considering maintenance and repair, worth it to me and, literally, millions of others.  You are, it seems to me, making an assumption that an electronic parking brake is destined to fail...it's inevitable.  Well, you're wrong.  Some will fail but the vast majority (probably in the 90+% range I'd guess) will never fail.  I can afford to replace my power window actuators/motors, air conditioning parts, electrically actuated/operated seat motors.  I want a backup camera, a nav system (built into the dash).  All those things can and may fail, I don't care, I can afford the once in a lifetime failure/fix while enjoying the 99% uptime.  The parking brake issue you're making is nonsense to me given the likelihood of it ever failing.  I didn't buy my current daily driver because it had an electric parking brake, but it is convenient, I've used it hundreds of times, and it hasn't failed.  If you don't like them, I'm fine with that.  Don't buy a car with one if it makes you feel better about your choices.  I'm declaring the horse dead; answer if you must but I'm finished.

But now I'm 62, and the legs don't bend like they used to.  I can't sit with my legs folded for any length of time, or the ache and then searing pain gradually increases so in about half an hour, I'm about to scream because it hurts so much.  I need to be able to straighten out my legs. Something to do with the effects of tendonitis & arthritis. So even though I could potentially get into a smaller car, it would hurt like hell to bend my knees to a 90 degree angle just to get into it, and would hurt more because I could never straighten them out. BTW the pants I wear are a 36\" inseam, if that describes my leg length better. Oh, BTW, when I was a kid, there WERE cars with plenty of legroom.  Over time, they disappeared, as the corporations simply stopped making them in order to save money, and just focused on making cars for the average sized people, and the big folks were screwed. I had a 1986 928 which I could just barely fit into and stretch out once I was in it; after that, I had to always unbolt the seats, and fashion a home made steel bracket about 4\" further back, making sitting behind me impossible for anyone who had legs. The second reason for a large SUV is, I've worked in emergency rooms all my life. During the winters, we always have old guys either getting heart attacks from trying toshovel snow, or hurting themselves pushing cars or slipping on ice. A big SUV means never shoveling yourself out of the snow. Just leave it in 4WD when parked before it snows. 2' of snow? Who cares. I've even climbed over plowed in 3' high plowed mounds of iced crud with my Broncos and now Expy, with only the stock 31\" tires. So; no heart attacks for me, or back injuries due to snow. All because of having the right car.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "D.E.B. B"}

I used to have the very joyfull experience of changing the whole audio system in my cars and buidling it all myself. But now? You're stuck with a fucking ugly interface and very limited radio capacity. Yes, for SOME of the cars you can still find a plate which allows you to separate cooling controls from the radio and thus lets you change the radio for a good one, but its harder and harder to do find one. And specifically about the tablet, i have to admit that some manufacturer are doing it the right way. Cadillac for instance. It doesn't look like they bought a cheap I pad and glued it somewhere random on the dash.\n\nOne thing I completely disagree with you thou is about fake air intakes. I mean ok you can have your own taste, but to most people, a car with great visuals upgrade is looking far better, way less boring looking. I mean, everywhere in the world there has been stores that sell these for years. So that the manufacturers at last figured that out and began designing cars with visual touches is a GREAT move forward that is pleasing way more people than the opposite.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "saabsly1"}

Turbos...pretty much every diesel on the road has 'em...for decades now. Big wheels started in the 80s with 16 inchers over 14s as an option. They do serve a purpose other than looks, though. A bigger tire has a larger circumference, allowing longer run out and better tire life. In the 80s I was replacing tires every 20k -30k miles. Now it's more like 50k. Tire technology has dramatically improved as well, but part of that is having a tire circumference of 90 inches as opposed to 70 inches the 80s, for example. That's about 150 less revolutions per mile, allowing tires to last longer. Definitely agree about the tacked on afterthought of some touch screens. As you mentioned, though, so many of the trends are consumer driven.

{"cid": "UgyOCqkpxagjT8tu5LR4AaABAg", "text": "While we are on this topic, the worst trend in modern cars is the propensity of car makers to bury everything so that even seasoned mechanics go nuts just to change a light bulb or fix a five dollar hose. There is no reason why an auto maker cannot add a few extra inches in either direction under the hood so that people can access basic things such as hoses, belts, batteries and more without having to remove major assemblies. It seems as if the auto makers are purposely burying things just to keep people from fixing their own cars or going to a mechanic other than the one at the dealer.\n\nThe next major peeve is the unwarranted denial of information necessary to reset the on board computers after a repair or event causes an error. We seriously need to pass a right to repair act to force all makers of anything to provide all information necessary for the owner to service the product themselves if they choose to do so. The cock and bull excuses given by manufacturers that there is proprietary information in the computer is nothing but a load of garbage given to fool lawmakers into allowing the ripoff to continue. This trend has been getting worse as the number and sophistication of computers in the products we buy continues to rise. All manufacturers of anything computerized should be required to include a backup disc or thumb drive with all necessary resets and full instructions to enable a normal person to reset their onboard computers to nominal status after a physical repair or event causes a glitch in the system. There is no reason for the current ripoff to continue.\n\nOn the positive side, a nice basic work truck and a nice basic low priced big family car and/or SUV would be nice as well. All of the American auto makers made such a thing right up through the middle 1990s and then stopped. We need to bring back the unbreakable slant six which all the big automakers made some version of to power such vehicles. The tiny, feature packed, mechanically inaccessible little compacts which masquerade as family cars are not sufficient. They are just as difficult to repair as the higher end cars in many cases and they are plagued with the same arrogant attitude about onboard computers which need to be reset to the tune of hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars for a ten second download at the dealer.\n\nPerhaps what we really need is for some enterprising entrepreneur to develop a universal replacement for all or most of the on board computers used in today's vehicles which will run all of the mechanical functions so an owner can throw away the ripoff proprietary computers. There is a serious potential for hackers and organized crime to rip off the codes so that we can bypass the dealer and manufacturer ripoff.

It shows the temperature for driver/passenger or system/outside, the HVAC status, and the entertainment system information all in a bright, easy to read display that was visible regardless of the lighting conditions. All the controls were tactile and intuitive. That allowed the driver to look at one spot for that information without having to guess which info was being displayed. With the addition of Navigation and EVs which have other information to display, I'd like to see the displays mimic that arrangement by having a fixed set of information across the top for all the basic functions and the open part be used for nav and system display with limited pages, and all controls remain tactile including page scroll and zoom. That eliminates the distraction and keeps the screen clean. The knobs and buttons in my CX-9 weren't physically connected to anything and only sent signals to a processor, so they were far simpler to engineer and install compared to having cables and huge wiring harnesses.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Writer B.L.

Current CVT's also do this with out a paddle or button, the problem is they simulate either a 6,7,8 etc. speed transmission so the common person who can't understand how a CVT works does not freak out when the car is holding 5k RPM for extended periods of times, however this reduces the acceleration of the car. \n\nSimulated gear CVT's often have a slight downside in terms of fuel efficiency during highway since when you are at a constant speed and low throttle input the CVT should maintain the lowest gear ratio possible.

Just because engine revs are high doesn't mean the car is accelerating the \"quickest\". Take a standard transmission for example, you can rev it out in 1st gear and still be going 30mph. Or you can be doing a much lower rpm in a higher gear and be going 100mph. Same thing in a CVT, where revs may be high but it relies on the transmission \"changing ratios\" to accelerate, rather than gear changes. Often when you force the engine to maintain high revs, the car still feels sluggish, due to the CVT having to change the ratio to change the speed of the car while the revs stay constant. CVTs are not designed to be sporty or quick, and when you rev the shit out of the engine it defeats the purpose of it, while still getting shit performance lol.

As a new car buyer, I find it very tiring sifting through all the unneccessary crap that's either part of the vehicle or coming out of the salesman's mouth. I really wish they had stayed away from CVT transmissions too. Or at least until they had got them more reliable, quieter, and with greater load capacity for towing. Most are only 750kg unbraked, which represents a tiny single axle garden trailer loaded with grass clippings .\nI hate the piano black plastic as it scratches so easily, gets static charged and retains dust and dirt. Plastic chrome is tacky and cheap. And, as you pointed out, 18 or 20\" Wheels all very fine until it comes time to buy new ones. $250 each for the new Subaru Outback, and that's the cheapest price I could find for a reasonably good quality tire. That does not include fitting and balancing and the disposal fee for the old tires. That's right, old tires are such a pollutant they charge a disposal fee in the country I mostly reside in. The touch screens on some some cars are not touch screens at all but plastic pressure screens that require more pressure to operate and lag, like the ones in the 2015 Ford Fusion and Mondeo. But at least they are part of the dashboard and not an intrusive, in the way wall, sticking up on top of the dashboard. As for Turbo's, I actually liked the one in the Ford that delivered about 240 HP from a 2 liter gasoline engine. But, glad I don't have one now, as the fuel economy in the latest 2.5 gasoline Outback is nothing short of amazing. Some of this would be attributed to the CVT trannie I think. Though I would have preferred a regular hydraulic transmission that will most likely last longer and take more load and torque without slipping.

Yeah, make your hatchback stupidly high so it handles worse, is less aerodynamic, heavier, and has no more usable space, all while mounting the headlights level with my roof so that for the 6 months of the year when I do all my driving at night, i've got what looks like full beams shining in my face or in my mirrors. Same with the trend of driving big 4x4s, which fed the whole crossover thing.\n\nPlastic anything on anywhere that gets hot. This has been a problem for a long time though, but its only getting worse. Include any kind of external water pump/plastic water pump impellors (BMW and Audi had a race to the bottom on this)\n\nLow profile wheels with hard suspension to make everything feel sporty without actually having to engineer quality suspension which gives a well handling car that is also not backbreaking to drive. Not so much a problem in Germany where the roads are good quality, but in the third world of the UK, it's unbearable. Not to mention its easy to kerb up wheels when there is no tyre to protect them.\n\nBullshit fuel economy figures. In the early 2000s you could actually achive them, but now, not a chance. Emissions standards have a lot to answer for too. They haven't done much in actually lowering real world emissions, but have succeeded in adding a bunch of pointless crap to cars. Many current cars are much less fuel effecient than previous versions because they are so much bulkier, and have to cope with downsized engines that drink through needing to be worked hard with a turbo spun up all the time.\n\nOh, and before I forget, Dual clutch gearboxes.

Technology, I own a 2018 Accord and while I like the car in general I've had more problems with it because of the technology than any other car I've owned. Example, my TPMS light kept going off even after I had a slow leak fixed, i thought it was the sensor or some software issue. I would recalibrate to turn the light off knowing my air pressure was just fine but to no avail. I found a software fix for it that hasn't been rolled out in mass and was preparing to have it loaded however in reading some articles I found 1 article that said after recalibration you must drive the car for 20-30 minutes between 30-60 MPH in order for the calibration to take affect. What! Can you imagine having to do that after every air fill? I did like it said and guess what , no TPMS light for a week now. Good lord that is ridiculous. The least manufacturers can do is test, test, test before putting out a sensor that needs babysitting after every calibration. Needless to say, I doubt everyone knows about this but me.

If there is not enough oxygen in the chamber, then your fuel will combust incompletely, leaving CO (Carbon monoxide, which is highly toxic) and C (the black soot shit) as byproducts instead of CO_2. Reactions, including combustion reactions are not just limited to the concentration of reactants, but the temperature of the engine, the pressures within the chamber, etc. This is basic high school chemistry. \n\nOf course there are thermodynamic friction losses throughout the rest of the vehicle, but internal combustion can always be improved. It's why there are fewer pollutants that exit your engine at the end of the day, and it's also part of the reason why newer airplane jet engines, despite the planes having relatively the same design since the 50s, are still getting far more efficient.

Yes, they have their place and yes, they are great at delivering instant acceleration.  For me, and this is not meant to bash anyone with an EV,  but I do not like the idea of having to search for a charging station, possibly wait for someone to finish using it, and then wait about an hour to recharge.  I put about 20K -30K miles on my vehicles a year, depending on where I travel to.  Charging times, at least currently, are too long for me.  Another concern is storms.  How do you charge your vehicle if the power grid is down in your area such as if a hurricane hits?  If I want to travel a great distance that is kind of remote, I can always carry an appropriate amount of fuel cans in the back of my truck.  You can't carry a bucket of electrons to carry around as extra fuel.  Anyway, EV is great for people who just stay in their local area and return home.  At least for now, not so great for long-distant travelers.  \nThe mention of Sun and Wind for power generation:  Sun and Wind requires a lot of real-estate to get the same amount of energy of a modest conventional power plant.  Windmills look horrible, are noisy, and kill countless numbers of birds.  Solar is very expensive and the panels that are out are certainly getting better, but efficiency still has a long way to go. \nThe ICE has a lot of potential still.  With fuel cells and hydrogen power, you can create very clean-burning engines.  We just need to extract H from water or the air, not from petroleum like we currently do.  I'll end with this:  I am an all the above technology guy.  There is room and a need for all forms of energy production.  I just do not want to see the ICE rushed out of production and replaced with an inferior technology.  I want personal choice, not a government-mandated order.

{"cid": "UgxESEjjJp0AaNdldz54AaABAg", "text": "One thing about the screen being glued to the dashboard: There's a good reason for that: a) They can design the rest of the dashboard in a more attractive way, and more importantly b) the screen is higher up, in the drivers sight. That means you don't have to look down to control things, which in turn makes it safer to operate. With the amount of features a modern car (luckily) has, doing it all via buttons isn't an option. I am annoyed by car manufacturers removing buttons altogether, or replacing them with touch sensitive buttons (I'm looking at you, VW! The infotainment systems in the facelifted Golf are a big step backwards, and moving climate controls to the screen is just stupid and bad design!), but having a screen itself isn't the issue. It's how they pick what features they put on buttons and which they don't.\n\nIMHO the pre-facelift Golf Mk 7 infotainment systems are amongst the best there are. You have a step surrounding the screen, which means you have a place you can rest your fingers to stabilize them on bumpy roads. There are also physical buttons around the screen to let you switch to different menus and functions, and you can blindly feel where you are without looking. There's a sensor that knows when your hand is near the screen, so when there isn't it maximizes the viewing area. Once you get closer to the screen, the buttons appear. All climate controls are placed in a separate area, where they are laid out logically. There are dials where necessary, too. And, very important too, the infotainment unit is structured in a logical way. You'll easily find what you are looking for. It could be mounted a bit higher, but it's still reasonable.\n\nWith the facelift they replaced the buttons with touch buttons, the screen is much glossier, slippier AND it doesn't have a lip that gives the fingers support so they stay in place (so on bumpy roads you're going to be all over the place.

However, I am a bit surprised that you didn't talk about a certain trends that are becoming more and more of an increase problem for us everyday drivers and I blame part of the problem on our government ever since they deregulate them.  The damn auto manufacturers wanted headlights deregulated so they can have an easier time in designing new cars.  But unfortunately this has created a new problem for us other drivers which we are forced to deal with everyday and is only become more and more of an increasing problem.  For instance, a lot of new car headlights on SUV and trucks are positioned to high where they beam directly into an on coming driver eyes thus blinding them which creates a safety risk and potential driving hazard.  Furthermore, to make matters worst many of these new cars are now using hi intensity lights where their low beams are just as intense as their high beams.  Which now creates an even greater chance for accidents this to occur.\n\nThere is another growing trend that you didn't mention as well and is huge problem now.  Many new cars have super bright daytime driving lights where a lot of drivers do not either realize nor bother to turn on there main lights during nighttime driving.  I cannot tell you how many cars I have encountered during nighttime that do not have their tail lights on at all and only further add to road hazards especially in fog, heavy rain and snow.\n\nOur government needs to bring back regulations to the auto manufacturers industry since they cannot seem to be responsible enough to build a car correctly.   Also all new cars should be equipped with the following standard equipment:\n\nPermitted auto-on lights - since the driver cannot be trusted to turn them on.\nCar remotes - safety reason.\nHeated door mirrors - safety reason.\nRadio controls on steer wheel - safety reason.\nBackup camera - safety reason.\nBlack box with cameras front, sides and rear for accident and safety protection.\nLane changing system - safety reason.\nAuto brake system - safety reason.\nHands-free Bluetooth- safety reason.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Stormfire962 #IMASTARCITIZEN"}

In the US rearview cameras will be demanded by law soon and it is expected that other countries will implement similar regulations as well.\nAlso, you don't understand the business model that makes the German car industry so crushing and so more successful than anybody else:\nThe margin on a base model with basic functions is small. The margin on options is gigantic. They make the money with customizability and quality options because nobody just buys a base model without anything. But the European customer is way more demanding when it comes to colors, interior etc. so that is why the German Mercedes customers can enjoy the Boutique system where you can individualize leathers, colors etc. and nobody oversees gets it. There you can only get certain packages. But same logic: The big margin is in the options.\nExample: My base C63S is 86k Euro, and I put options into it, so my MSRP for my specific configuration was 115k Euro. The margin of AMG on the 86k is \"OK\" at best, but \"Gigantic\" on the 30k.

You could see a swing in trend, which has been happening, that they are more common. The best way to see what’s around you is still not being lazy and turning your head and body to look at your surroundings. There could eventually be a law placed stating vehicles from this date forward must have such equipment if it was deemed that such equipment MUST be necessary to operate a vehicle like a bumper. Second, I never said eliminate option from vehicles. Of course that’s what attracts certain buyers to a vehicle is having something with more bells and whistles. What I’m saying is eliminating a base model car and forcing you to have what use to be options as standard is hurting the consumers. The price of a nice reliable car keeps escalating to the price of a small house. If you had a base model with less tech you don’t need more customers would be purchasing new cars more often. It’s a no brainer that manufacturers make more money off options. That’s just business 101. I don’t need to understand the German market as I live in the United States.

At some point Ford gave up on the turbo 4 in the Mustang because when driven appropriately (hammer down as often as possible) the T4 got worse mileage than the 302 V8.\n\nRemember the Buick Reatta? In all but its final year it had a monochrome CRT touchscreen in the dash to operate pretty much everything, and its user interface was horrible. The system was also available the same years on the larger Riviera, which the 2 seater Reatta was based on.\n\nReplacing the CRT with a color LCD and mini computer to replicate all its original functions, but with a better UI, along with adding things like GPS, rearview camera etc, would be a fun project.

Every part serves a purpose as anything unnecessary is cut off to save weight, Expensive computer technology (like 6-axis IMUs) are used only for making faster lap times and to help you manage the often completely insane engines, yet still use very simple wiring harnesses to save weight and cut down complexity... Of course I am more than open to the fact that motorcycles are more than impractical, I'm just saying that car manufacturers need to see what actually makes a machine good instead of just wasting the consumers time and money with all of this bullshit... Also wouldn't non-dealer mechanics be getting steadily screwed over by all of this Bullshit that car manufacturers are pulling off?﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Jackson Flax"}

The manufacturers and designers should design and install build-in concealed type day/night security car cameras (CAM) for front/right/left/rear/fish-eye interior views system with easy download files in smart phones!     \n \n 5) Infotainment; This is absolute not necessary, nearly anyone have smart phones! The car should allow to install manual Hi-Fi radio surround sounds system, GPS / Maps data system, hand-free phone system, carwings instant traffic report system are adequate for going from A to B! \n \n 6) Oversize wheels & tyres; Only for high performance sport/race cars or some expensive 7 seats SUVs! \n \n 7) Panino black shinny gloss plastic & plastic-chrome; These decoration gimmick doesn't look that bad! Again when use for long time under hot Sun and scratched! They don't look as good! Replacement or re-coating cost a lot of money!  \n\n 8) Turbo everything; Turbo only necessary for those high performance sport / race cars / expensive cars and modern diesel vehicles. \n\n 9) Fake vents & exhaust tips; Cosmetic gimmick! But we can't stop manufacturers doing such things! \n  \n10) Truth in marketing & advertising; This is how they spent money in their financial account to lower their tax! Some sort of tax planning! \n\nOther things not necessary is the electronic foot e-brake; electronic e-brake button! A good old style (very simple & practical) hand pull e-brake lever located just next close to your right leg for left hand drive is excellent design for drivers.\n\nFor 4WD vehicles the use of good old style simple 4WD selector lever is the best design option.\n\nFor all cars the use of centre located automatic / manual stick shift / electronic selector lever is the best design option as well!\n\nAll cars should included paddle shifters also good!﻿", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Peter Tse"}

Super over complicated, poorly designed and poor sound quality. Why do you need 19 Bose speakers that Audi put in to a Q7 too? I have a 2004 GM (a Australian Holden Berlina). It has separate climate control and a standard double DIN for the stereo with split speakers in the front and a single speaker in each of the rear doors. One of the first things I did when I got the car used was replace the factory stereo and speakers with after market models to get a much better sounding system. I just upgraded my stereo again recently to a new Sony unit that has a volume dial and supports CarPlay and Android Auto. I did the install myself, works fantastic. I can operate most the the climate control without having to take my eyes off the road and an actual volume dial is just plain sensible. I have steering wheels controls for the stereo that were factory fitted and I hooked them up to the new stereo and they all work but the volume dial is so much faster to use, I always use it instead. \n\nI also hate the button electronic hand brakes. Dumbest idea ever. Why over complicate it? A handle you pull up to engage the brake via a cable is simple yet effective. I get in my mums car which has one of these new brakes and I don't know if it's on or off until I start driving down the road and dash starts beeping at me. How do you do a hill start with these things? This is similar to the electronic door handles which are stupid too.\n\nAll this over the top tech is going to make these cars super expensive to repair in the future if you can get the parts.

Like a hellcat sound for a Prius to joke with your friends.\r\n2. Hidden handles - Not just a gimmick... it helps with aerodynamics (the main reason Tesla uses them), and style.\r\n3. Raised Screen - Completely disagree. Contouring the dash around the screen either lowers the screen or raises the dash... Either the screen is farther from the road or the dash obscures the road.\r\n4. Complication - I agree mostly, but reading the comments from consumers they almost always complain if all 3000 features they saw on another vehicle isnt wedged into the base model of the vehicle they can afford. Consumer demand is driving it. Also, lower-cost vehicles usually come with simpler systems.\r\n5. Infotainment - First it is a relic term at this point. The screen is not an entertainment screen it is used to interact with features of the vehicle and most are not intended to be used while driving... some even disable while driving. This is basically the same complaint as the previous one.\r\n6. Large diameter wheels - I disagree for the most part. Unless the sidewall is extremely thin the problem of wheel damage and rough ride is not an issue. A larger wheel/thinner sidewall has less tire roll and instability with the control of the suspension more in the engineering rather than the unpredictable movement of air-filled rubber. There are plenty of lower cost options for tires of any size.\r\n7. Gloss Black/chrome - Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it is stupid. Fingerprints are there whether you see them or not... I would rather see them.\r\n8. Turbos - He addressed the regulations conflicting with consumer demand... so yeah I agree it is an issue.

I went through two sets of wheels before finally throwing the nice looking wheels and low profile tires in a dumpster and replacing them with higher profile tires and steel wheels. No, larger wheels do no increase fuel economy. Lower rolling resistance does. While yes, a mechanical advantage can be  had with a larger overall tire diameter, most vehicles spec the same overall wheel and tire circumference no matter what wheel option you have. A 205/55/16 has the same overall diameter as a 225/45/17. So does a 255/35/18. All three have a 25\" diameter.

Big low profile tire dont deform as much but are more heavy then normal big tire (bigger rims, and yes aluminium is heavier then rubber almost 2x). Also define higher speed if you mean 100km/h+ (60mph) the aerodynamic drag is bigger problem. So you want to have low profile and be close to the ground. Witch is oposite in cars with big wheels. Also wider wheels create more drag.\n\nThe suspention, drivetrain and engine is tuned to its spesific tire radius. If you instal a larger diameter tires that the manufacturer recomend not only it affects acceleration a bit but your speedometer and odometer will display lower speed and distance.

I also hate the new trend of using radar systems for auto braking, just a personal thing since I use a radar detector to avoid cops in Florida and Georgia, but it’s really annoying when ever I’m near a new minivan and my radar detector suddenly goes off full blast because I’m passing one or they got too close to the car in front of them. I’d think they would be able to use some other standardized radar frequency that radar detectors could be designed to ignore or one that police don’t use. I  also hate the new trend of using plastic for exterior body panels and bumpers, what happened to having big steel bumpers on trucks and SUV’s that wouldn’t crack if you accidentally back into a pole or someone accidentally backs into you at a low speed. Lastly I think these new LED headlights are ridiculously bright, my 2005 MINI cooper S and 2002 BMW 325xi both have Xenon HID’s in them and were required to have an auto leveling system in them to keep from blinding oncoming traffic when going up and down hills, however today’s LEDs are far brighter and seem to have no systems required to keep from blinding on coming traffic. There are systems developed to control and move headlights so that they don’t blind oncoming traffic and can recognize where an oncoming car is and move the headlights so as not to shine directly at the oncoming vehicle.

And that was around 1963. Instead of being tested occasionally for skills, all the government does is hand out some tickets and take reports after crashes. \n   In the us alone (4% of tbe world population) we have hundreds of thousands of crashes each year half of which cause injuries, and tens of thousands of deaths. We as drivers take the primary responsibility of course, but that doesnt work obviously. The governments need to do MUCH more to make our driving experiemce safer. They need to go to the meat of the matter and get our licensed drivers in a better position to even be behind the wheel.

How it is going to pan out when 7 people in a vehicle towing a trailer on a dirt road on holiday has to carry on with a wheel one level up from what you find on a wheelbarrow \n\nAshtrays - man their shapes are useless. They could be such great charging docks for phones instead. \n\nSun visors that better wrap around oreet up with the rear view mirror. Nothing as annoying as the epic game of playing dodgems with between the setting sun and your eyeball. Yes just one eyeball at a time. \n\nUnergonomic door handles. How hard can this be people? \n\nCupholders - you'd think it's something the human race would have mastered by now, having been to the moon and all. \n\nLumbar support - because why not?

{"cid": "UgwcAa3jUjxiC42OpGx4AaABAg", "text": "After I have spent 60K$ on the worst fucking terrible piece of garbage I have had in my life, namely a 2015 Acura TLX V6 SH-AWD, which is such an absolute disgrace on every imaginable point, every single time I drove this thing I was frustrated like I never imagined I could be. Now I know how \"too much worthless tech\" feels. I am speaking of Acura because I have been burnt so deeply in my soul with all their unreliable, cheesy, cheap and sub-par tech they put to try to justify a totally inadequate 60K$+ price tag; yet it definitely seems to be a dangerous trend in the now \"way too much regulated and poisoned automotive world\". Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't even have spent 20K$ on this rubbish junkyard crap. In 3 years and 50'000 km I have even lost over 40K$ because of how much this vehicle cannot hold any value. It was my 5th Acura and it was the last, sadly, every one before it were very very good cars, probably because they were made in Japan I don't know but the coincidence is weird. One thing that made me cringe more than anything else in this shit box was the transmission. The ZF 9 speed automatic. What a legendary dirt cheap unreliable and dysfunctional piece of shit. I never thought a transmission could be so utterly dumb, jerky, slow... so inefficient in every single way except saving fuel... It had one job which was to shift gears and it failed truly miserably at it. Oh and how in a sister shack they thought people like me really care about fuel economy when buying a V6 3.5L??? If you want to save fuel then go buy a Prius! Oh god how bad this thing was it should be criminalized to sell these things. I was a die hard car guy in my heart, but this time I truly had the feeling of being fucked deeply in the ass with a telephone pole after committing to spend a fortune on this mechanical disgrace. After this experience I have been searching in the darkest places to find a real car, or at least to find out if it still existed. I was lucky, I guess, boiling everything down to the only proper choice I had found: a Subaru WRX STI, without the tech package. Yes it still has a key, a manual transmission, a manual handbrake, manual adjustment for seats, big knobs and no fucking controls on unresponsive touchscreen, etc. everything seems just right and ultra solid in a beautifully simple and absolutely pleasant package. I can say I have never been more happy and satisfied with a car purchase than this one. It's like these 3 utterly painful and frustrating years (which felt like decades really) of pure hate have suddenly gave way to peace and happiness and satisfaction. The only 2 boxes my STI does not tick is the poor quality sound system and turbo lag. Everything else is just absolutely perfect and makes me smile every single time I take the wheel. Even in winter, which has already arrived here with 2 feet of snow already. Equipped with great studded snow tires, it's just so satisfying to drive and slide in every corner with absolute traction exactly when you need it.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "William Switzer"}

Send the designers to a college 101design course to get some pointers. I'm sure that there's plenty of people like me that want that car. As time goes, it seems that cars are less desirable - hard to find anything that I'm willing to buy due to quirks. I tried a lot and there's nothing ideal out there. Porsche gets my pick for what I 'want' to drive and own despite its their flaws.

Never been comfortable with this.\nRegarding the turbo everything, it started because of Europe's retarted emissions laws, therefore the philosophy was to reduce engines, but because the car needs a certain power to run a certain way and the building materials kind of weigh the same they needed to turbo, otherwise they would obtain those mini 1.25 l engine as per 2007-8 Fiesta that barely accelerates with 4 people inside. I guess the turbo trend was directed towards other markets as US and Asia.

The truth is when factoring for inflation cars cost pretty much exactly the same as they did back when I started driving in the mid 70’s. Not only that but you get A LOT more for the same price. Modern cars are not only infinitely safer but they also handle better, are more fuel efficient, have more horsepower per liter, and have a lot more creature comforts than cars of the 60’s and 70’s. Not to mention the fact that they don’t require constant tune ups and they will go much farther before requiring a total engine rebuild. \n\nI do agree with you on some points however. For example, although I love technology, I still like a physical knob to control the radio volume and the AC fan. Luckily some car companies are finally wising up and going back to knobs for certain things.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "SLOBeachboy"}

New cars are so well insulated that you literally cannot hear the engine and it takes a lot of fun out of the drive. I think audi's execution of this with the soundaktor gives the best and most natural feeling sound.\n3. Infotainment systems allow you to control tons of features without cluttering up the dash with hundreds of buttons. Again, a necessary change that people may not like, but it's the most efficient way to control multiple systems. \n4. Small turbo engines. The death of large v6 and v8 engines cannot come soon enough. The amount of power and fuel economy these new 4 cylinder turbos can achieve is amazing.

In addition to this, headlight manufacturers no longer sell lenses to replace sun-damaged ones so the only option after the lens cracks is to buy a whole new headlight ($2100 each if you have a BMW F10 5 series...). Typing this makes me so pissed off lol. I just restored the headlights on my 1998 BMW 7 series using brand new thick GLASS lenses ($100 shipped from Europe!!) and new chrome reflectors for 1/20th of the time and cost to restore the lights on a newer BMW... while still having a better looking car than anything BMW has built since then.

Another thing im tired of, Cars that have the dial keys. (the ones that look like a damn stove knob) that you cant turn on unless you have a key fob. If you want to add in new tech, go ahead and add it in. Atleast make it useful, and something that adds to the car. If I have to have the key fob to turn the stove knob on my new car, why not just give me a keyfob with a key on it that I have to keep track of? Instead of putting a stupid fucking dial in there where they key would go. Auto start/stop just wastes the starter, and another thing- overly complicated seats. Can you really not pull on a simple latch to move your seat back and forth? Had a buddy who blew a fuse in his seats and it cost him $650 for a new seat. Just for one fuse to one of the 8 cushions. At the end of the day, its simply planned obsolescence, fill a car with items that easily break so that you get more money out of it after the purchase date.

{"cid": "UgxNT6aFA7hAijVknix4AaABAg", "text": "I only agree with about half this list.  And sorry, you're full of misinformation - my source:  I'm a GM/Ford Service Tech.\n\n1.  Auto Stop/Start is not dumb, fake induction noise is dumb, yes.  Auto stop/start is used to eliminate the wasting of gas at long stops, and thus eliminating the emissions waste.  To top this off, the feature can be MANUALLY TURNED OFF (Plebians).  These vehicles use a Bi-Directional Crank Position Sensor to compensate for the very slight backspin of a crankshaft when you shut an engine off.  Computer knows where the crankshaft is during the shutoff and even after.  They also use a secondary battery, or an AGM battery to keep electronic features on, and the vehicle will not shut off if the battery is too weak, or a huge collection of very important conditions have not been met, including engine temp, vehicle speed attained since last shut off, and climate control load.\n\n2.  The Cruze does not suffer a \"Known turbo issue\".  The turbos on those vehicles going out is only an indication that someone didn't take care of their freaking car.  DexOs oil changes at 6k miles AS THE OWNER'S MANUAL SAYS, and not shutting your car off the moment you put it in park after putting it under heavy boost loads will make only random failure occur.  There's plenty of very high mileage Cruzes out there on the original turbo, and last, manufacturers are NOT just 'slapping them on there'.  GM makes all of their turbos internally, an engineer did his job to come up with the turbo, and they came up with a system to protect the turbo.  After the 2nd Gen Cruze, the 2015+ Malibu, the 1.4T Dart, and many other modern turbo cars actually use the cooling system to maintain the turbo temperature, instead of just the oil feeds that lubricate their impellers.\n\nThe only true part of the Cruze statement is the cooling system issues.  Yes, it has cooling system issues.  Water pump, water outlet, and the thermostat bypass hose tend to leak.  Water pump is the only one that's really notorious, though, and GM rectified the other issues in Gen 2.  \n\nFuel economy standards are forcing manufacturers to up the game on their economy.  You can't stick a 1.0 liter engine in a modern car and expect it to get out of its own way.  35mpg is about the best most manufacturers could get without Variable Valve Timing coming alone, Direct Injection, and better engineered engines. So no, sorry, they're not slapped on to get more power.  They are a step that manufacturers resorted to due to overwhelming pressure to up emissions and economy.\n\n3.  Yeah, fake noise can get out.  After working on a lot of these cars, some of the over complicated systems are ridiculous.  Radio controls and some BUS systems are ridiculous.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Kieva Storm"}
