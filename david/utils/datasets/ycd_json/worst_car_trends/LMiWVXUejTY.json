Surely you only need one car to do that? Or do you find when you break down a car and rebuild it you don't have enough parts to make a complete one again ..... in your case I suspect that may be the truth of it.

{"cid": "Ugz0mNJTJAYLTRsAqB54AaABAg", "text": "The DPRK has planned on a long protracted war with the US as given evidence to how well they're dug into their mountainous fortresses.  They've studied battles like Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Iraq (remember that the Imperial Japanese used Korean forced labor to build island fortresses). \n\nIf conflict turns toward the likes of Iraq, then the world can expect an insurgency to remain in North Korea. This insurgency will get their support from their traditional allies.\n\nThe best we could probably hope for is that the North Koreans develop a loose confederation of army general warlords that revolt against Kim Jong Un and force him into an enclosed Pyongyang (think of China's Ming Dynasty and their once Forbidden City).\n\nThen an interim North Korean government could be established to negotiate a slow amalgamation of the North Korean generals to a unified political party that reunites with the South.  \n\nWe can expect China and possibly Russia to stymy this. The Japanese may be reluctant too, but not obstructive.  The South Koreans would also have to fight their own indifference toward a reunification.  \n\nThe reason for this is that Koreans aren't Germans, and this isn't the 1980s.  A reuinified Korea presents an economic threat to its neighbors.  Thus, the resistance and apprehension of its neighbors. \n\nAlso, a sluggish reunification of a people so thoroughly exploited, brainwashed, and backwards will be an incredible burden on the South Koreans--much more so than what East Germans were on West Germans.  At least in Germany, there was the advantage of many centuries of a strong Christian culture to help heal the wounds upon reunification. And, the divisions Germany suffered weren't nearly as long as the Koreas'.\n\nLikewise, when the reunification happens, we can expect Chinese and Russian interference to hurry up the equalization of benefits knowing that forcing \"equality\" (equal outcome over equal opportunity) will futher complicate Korea's domestic burdens, thus hindering a reuinified progress (think about how South Africa's hurried process that still hasn't hit a national stride).\n\nHowever, when Korea is finally reuinified, it will be the economic and cultural powerhouse that could be somewhat compared to Germany. And, the reuinified Korea will remember it's friends as well as those who made them suffer--and who prolonged the suffering. I expect that when a reuinified Korea hits its national and natural stride, its influence will be such that both the Japanese and Chinese would even consider using the Korean alphabet to replace the way they write their languages.﻿", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Flatley"}

Your \"car person\" assessment is starting now and is judged based on 10 minutes of your video. \"If you think smart is a deathtrap\". In a country where pickup truck is king, and is legally a truck so it does not need to pass crash tests to be legally sold... while Smart passed the EuroNCAP crash tests with great results? Smart car safety what? Also the name \"jimny\" and being a competent offroader does not qualify a car for being \"weird\". And the defender 130 is a BIG car. Oh my god, really? That is so weird, for United States, with their love of Kei cars! Also a \"sink\" is something you put your dirty dishes in, not a Zonda. KTM X-Bow is street legal in Europe, don't guesstimate, and don't pull fact out of your ass. Roadster always meant a drop top model, not a \"long front engine car\", the word you're looking for is most likely Gran Tourer. Also you weren't alive when Hitler's Germany was waging war on the world, yet if you start making facts up, you'll be considered an ass and \"not being alive\" is no excuse.  In any case, you assessment is now complete. You are not a car guy, never make these videos about cars ever again.

This is directly from the NHTSA, and pertains ONLY to the R33; To learn the modifications the petitioner started were needed to conform Nissan Skyline vehicles to the FMVSS, you should go to the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS) website at http://www.regulations.gov/ and access docket number �NHTSA-2005-22654� by following the online instructions for accessing the dockets available at that web site. You should note that the petition sought import eligibility for 1990-1999 Nissan GTS and GTR \"Skyline\" passenger cars. After granting the petition, the agency learned that the modifications identified in the petition were not sufficient to conform certain model and model year vehicles that were covered by the petition. The agency therefore partially rescinded its grant of eligibility, leaving only R33 model Nissan GTS and GTR passenger cars manufactured between January 1, 1996 and June 30, 1998 eligible for importation.\nMe personally, i have driven an R32 (i think that is what it was, it was a 1989), once for more than a few hundred feet, and was not impressed by it in the least.

It's based off its engine and HP. it can also be judged off its technology and track times. In fact a viper people call a Modern Muscle car and people also class corvettes in the same class. Even if they were super cars a Lamborghini Aventador would be in the Hyper car range. There's a difference. Also yes, yes, they did kinda make up the word \"Hyper Car\" to make their muscle and sports car sound cooler but still hyper car as a title was made for a reason. Also a Huracan is classed as a super car because of the 5.2 litre V10. Also because they are releasing the new performante which holds the fastest lap on the Nüburgring which is the longest track in the world. The Huracan also produces 610HP which is still classed as a super car. A hyper car is about 700+ and a Mega Car (Yes there is such thing) is 1000+.﻿", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Keylonx"}
