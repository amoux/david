There are couple things that will separate these two machines, but of course their purpose is very different and it all depends on what you need them for.  The touch pad on the Windows machine is inferior, you need a mouse to operate it while the Mac does not need such thing. The Windows machine will take still a longer time to power up and at time crashes, lags or is slow. Being a business machine, my X1 has poor graphics but that's an option of course. As hardware it is quite clear that the Mac is more solid and overall better built. The OS on the Mac, although limited and not capable of handling complex networking work (what the X1 does very well), is rock stable and does a few things well - iMovie, photo editing, Photoshop, messaging integration and flawless (but pricey) integration with apple devices. So for the fun stuff, after work,  I will always choose the Mac. When I go back to work each morning, the X1 will perform well, is very portable and clearly designed to be carried around the office. For a true comparison, putting side by side an X1 with MAC OS configured and a Mac on Windows would be interesting.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Earth And Time Travel"}

All they do is create laptops that throttle despite the thermal capabilities of the cooling system. Imagine asking around the forum for a TDP fix for 2 months STRAIGHT without a single answer despite the same problem being brought up nearly 4-5 months ago in America. This is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever seen. Not a single admin or a dev team member EVER communicated more than once every 3 weeks. In nearly the entire forum of the E485. \n\nI spent 1.1K AUD expecting a functional machine, not a joke that needs 5 patches and 5 months of aids customer support to fix. Don't bother. Just get a xiaomi laptop. I now regret replacing it with the T480 because that, despite with dual pipelines and independent graphics, still manages to achieve throttling at a measly 70C due to a GOD DAMNED TDP LIMIT.

But that doesn't end with Lenovo. Look what's happening  to Dell and their business and gaming (Alienware) products. It's just insane. I got a Precision with 5 defects out of the box and sent it back next day. Alienware 15m is overheating even after undervolting, donwclocking and repasting! The list of crappy products is growing by the day.\nGoing back to Lenovo, they did a terrible job for sure. I'm still waiting on a BIOS fix that would put the right boot parameters, without which no linux can boot. \nAnd if you think Apple did a much better job - think again. Their laptops generally run hot, almost critically hot, and users are kept unaware. Build quality and QC is great though. But doesn't justify the price tag and poor level of performance for that price. \nAs of right now, I'm very happy with my E485. Last night I found a way to get even more performance out of the beast. In linux, I noticed that it performs much much better on battery. Because it restricts the CPU, so the GPU/iGP can get much more juice. So, I tweaked the CPU when on AC and viola, it runs some demanding games now better than laptops with MX150!\nI'm still gonna repaste it and possibly break into the BIOS to mod the TDP!", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Cimmerian Way"}

Yeah, that's what we, the original designers of the Thinkpad, called it - the G-Spot. But the marketing wieners didn't think that would be a proper name for it and renamed it. Then - without so much as a moment's notice - IBM sold the PC North America division to the Chinese which resulted in tens of thousands of American IBMers losing their jobs and retirement pensions. So....you can buy all the Chinese Lanovo junk and praise it to the high heavens.

Why did IBM sell the department to Lenovo? I think the answer is, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, that ThinkPad was not making enough profit for IBM. In other words, the ThinkPad product line did not make the investors expectation. In other words, thinkpad, the whole department, including you engineers, was not doing well enough to compete with other brands. Can you imagine Apple would sell the Mac department? No one would expect Apple to sell Mac line because Mac is one of the best out there, if not the best, and surely it‚Äôs making Apple a lot of money.

You could empty a beer into an old x230 and you didn't even had to shutdown. Also, deals great with cat piss! Try that on an f-ing macbook.  \n3) Rock solid hw. The average maintenance schedule is battery every 2-3 years, a fan every 5-10 and while you are at it, you can tighten the hinges (which is not really necessary in most of the cases). \n4) There is a reason these are mostly sold with \"mate\" displays. Compare using thinkpad outside during the day next to a device with a glossy glass display :D. \n5) People carrying thinkpads usually don't take part in conversations about what is the best computer or an operating system.

I have never seen someone use touchscreen unless there is no keyboard/trackpad/mouse present.  Lew, you guys should have gone with the better screen and gotten rid of touchscreen.  \n\nAlso as someone who has used lots of laptops/keyboards over the years I will say that I have a huge love/hate relationship with Lenovo/IBM laptops because of the eraser setup.  At first it's great but after a while I never use it because you can't move as quickly/accurately as you can with the touchpad and at that point it gets in your way when you type and do other things to the point where I would rather have that space back for my keys/hands/better touchpad which also Lew did not mention but to me...  the touchpads on Lenovo laptops have never been the greatest.  For me, I love my 2013 MBP touchpad because there is one click for the entire thing so no matter where I am on the pad I can click.  I turn off the tap-click because I type fast and have large hands and my palms touch the touchpad which moves the mouse all over the place and sucks when I'm trying to type something.  Lastly their multi-touch gestures still haven't been matched on the Windows side and that is sad.  Someone just needs to emulate the MBP touchpad and it's functions and they will make people love Windows again because W10, aside from the auto-updates and whatnot is really a great OS.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "thegreatcerebral"}

It is even cheaper than China, so I may change my choice in the future even I am in Canada. I used to have the X1 second gen and I am using the X1 yoga now. I suggest my friend to get the X1 carbon 6 gen. Based on my experience, X1 carbon has the best keyboard because it has more \"space\" for the keyboard. X1 yoga decrease the travel space and the reaction force of the keys because it needs to achieve the tablet mode. However, I don't think macbook air is the series to compare with the X1 carbon, macbook pro 13 is the one. And, the quality is really depend on the level of the production line. It is not professional if just compare between the brand. Dell xps, thinkpad X series are the highest level which have a better quality.

Still haven't bought a eGPU. \n\nLaptops are just meant to be used for work or school. Gaming laptops are a bit ridiculous. Plus storage is problematic. For thin laptops such as this, storage is mostly from nvMe or SSD. Making 1TB pretty expensive. \n\nBy that point you could probably spend 1k on a work laptop with a iGPU and 1k on a desktop rig. I have a second Laptop I got for around $500 that came with a i5, 8gb ram, and a GTX 1050ti. Which is the only reasonable \"Gaming Laptop\". I don't bring it with me to school as It's is alot heavier and takes up way more space which is a premium after textbooks. If I wanted to game, I'd game on my main rig. \n\nSo why do these expensive laptops have only intergrated graphics?\n1) Mostly targeted for workloads such as Microsoft Office\n2) Compact body. A larger focus on passive cooling. \n\nDell does sell a XPS 13 with 32 or 64gb of ram, a i7 and a 1050ti I believe for 4k. It is begging for thermal throttling. \n\nSo they could include a dedicated graphics card. But why would they?", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Henry Thai"}

This would be a very very narrow user population. About the physical buttons I really wonder how this would be more precise than clicking or right-clicking directly on the trackpad exactly where your pointer is, rather than leaving the trackpad to click with the possibility that the pointer move just a little bit while doing so. So much for accuracy. This might be a pro grade laptop, but you have Apple pro grade laptops too, which not school kids are using but various kind of professionals in various professions, including those for which security is paramount, not a notable feature on Windows. I wonder how many serious military pros are actually using Windows in any situation. Nevertheless, the miltary hardly represent \"most people\". Now kids at school and students, that makes much much more people than militaries. BTW You don't know, and I don't know if Apple's product would pass the military-grade requirements you speak of, so let us not speak about things we don't know. These military might not be using macOS either, but Windows being military graded? Seriously? Appart from the OS, all Macs are actual PCs. More intrigingly is your alias which suggests you're primary a gamer (maybe a profesionnal gamer as this exists apparently?), which, granted, is better served by Windows PCs than macs (Though in Boot Camp there is exactly no differences at equivalent processing specs), but that makes Windows PCs quite elaborate _toys for adult kids more than reliable secure tools for productive professionals, to me.
