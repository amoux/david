self driving cars is just going way too far.
seriously, grab a hsv from 2000 for 9 grand.
sg, just found you via tst completely agree.

tbh old cars are better than the modern cars
that'll be about 8 items here in california.
the american middle class is in big trouble.
the most honest review on youtube till today

if you don't want the tech, buy an older car.
in the us a vw golf base model around $20000?
is buying a used car a solution to problem 1?
it's not a bmw but it serves me far too well.

this is why i bought my $12,000 car cash kidd
to many electronics and sensors for dumb shit
totally agree. new cars are a fuckin rip off!
touchscreens in cars are the worst hands down
we don't need screens in cars, we have phones
what do you want a car to do more than drive?
who the fuck buys a new car every 7 years????
why do you need to buy a new car in your 20s?
you are absolutely right. i do agree with you
$300 worth of underwear, shitting myself. lolz
1st problem seems all about price for new car?
and exact reason why insurance costs more too!
approved. already up in your eyeballs in debt?
certain tech does not function price is lower!
go to college or have a business, that's life.
great video. would like to see more like this.
how does a headlight cost 214 fucking dollars?
i am at 5:20 and did he mention manuals yet???
is this guy making the video a complete moron?
key fobs are idiotic and expensive to replace!
let some other guy take the hit on a $42k car!
meanwhile my 1989 ford f-150 still works fine.
new cars have way more problems than old cars.

noo i stick on my gtr r33 fck all that sensors
reason number one is not about cars, actually.
small boats small storm large ships big storm.

u can get cheap family cars for about 9000 new
vw still has analog buttons and heating wheels
well, tesla is updating its software reguliary
well, this whole video was certainly bullshit.
why does he always cover up his rocking bod???
why the hell did youtube recommend this to me?
wtf kinda braindead people disliked this video
you don't buy a 40,000 dollar car when your 23
your budget should be like 5k on the high end.
your mad because new cars have new technology?
1991 volvo 240 daily driver, still going strong
all cars are built to sell. answers everything.
and guess how much i payed for it in late 2008?

i liked the section about touchscreens and apps
i think you have a bullshit perspective, buddy.
i totally agree with you ,thanks for the video.
i'm a mechanic good luck too you all suckers 😂
i've been saying this for about 20 years or so!
it is cheaper to run & better for maintenance!!
jeezus. what car's touchscreen is that at 7:00?
just too much badly executed touchscreen stuff.
modern cars look better than older cars lololol
ok, maybe my chevy vega wasn't so bad after all
on cost, you should ask why is it so expensive?
six bucks. something is wrong with millennials.
that is nothing to do with how capitalism works
the real problem is connectivity. fuck gadgets!
they both give you diarrhea after you buy them.
this dude better be driving a 1925 ford model t
this is a problem with modern i need it all man
this is why you lease. or buy an older japanese
this video is perfect, and im glad you made it.

whos' going to be dumb enough to buy that shit?
why do you need a new $40,000 car for a family?
why the f does this video has so many dislikes?
why the fuck do i need a touch screen in a car?
wow, we need communism, free cars for everyone!
3 grand all it needed was it's 100k maintinence!

if you do, just a while longer, then you upgrade
im giving it a liked before watching the video.!
in singapore a cheap hyundai costs like mercedes
is the ac or fan settings going to be different?
it all makes sense and i agree with you totally.
just don't be poor, otherwise just ride bycicles
leasing always under warranty and no repair cost
maintenance mostly will keep you out of trouble.
owner of 2001 c amry here. i feel like a winner!
price 2. bells & whistles 3. maintenance expense
remember when you could pick and choose options?
so you suggest to buy a car or not to buy a car?
sounds like you are just really good at whining.
technology is as bad as the plastic it comes in.
thats why i'm slowy restoring my 4th gen maxima.
the more thankful iam for my 2012 ford fiesta ^^
through 5.40 sounds more like hegelian dialectic
time is gonee i mean commonnn. seriusly man!? !?
which is why i'm 21 and buying classic 70's cars
why can’t you pay cash for a minivan under $20k?
why do you let capitalism sell to you so easily?
why i keep old car's running, to avoid this crap
wow this video is so true, why so many dislikes?
wow. you hit on the hegelian dialectic for cars!
you can get a decent family car in the 20,000's.
you can use your car touch screen while driving?
you cant put a aftermarket stereo in a 2010s car
you do realize you can buy the base model right?
you dont need a 40000 car. thats just rediculous
you're all part of what enslaves and destroy us.
and how the fuck do you turn the handbrake off???
bring back 1 2 din slots and aftermarket stereos.
buy a two year old. drive it till it falls apart.
buy benz. no touchscreens for those very reasons.
cough used cars solve all of these problems cough
dont prices in anything increase as time goes by?
from a factory trained and certified master tech!
fucking plastic parts that should not be plastic.

i agree completely. there's too much shit in cars
i agree with the first point but the second. meh.
i bought a 91 caprice to replace my 12 challenger
i loved my old ford escort with the manual shift.
i'm over 40 years old and i've never owned a car!
if cars were too expansive no one would buy them!
jeremy clarkson would be proud of you. well done.
just put down the phone and focus on the driving!
just the one that drives from point a to point b?
more important is modern cars just look like shit
my 94 honda civic is a mini tank it's unstoppable
on to your lugnuts. its tiiime for an overhaulll!
pause, why is the guy listening to diarrhea tips?
shit gets better and expensier, surprise surprise
should have added a 3rd, they're all fucking ugly
so much entitled millennial whining in one place.
so you are saying. people can't think by themself
soooooooo true. i completely agree with the video
tf didnearly 5,000 people dislike this video for?
that's how capitalism works, fuck you, stupid ass
that's unpossible read in voice of ralph wiggum .
the cost is included in the price of the vehicle.
the repair costs for the lights was really wrong.
they threw all the controls into the touchscreen?
this guy just went on how safety features are bad
this guy seems like he's not fun to hang out with
this is a fact and thank you for pointing it out.
this video needs more views. more than 1 million.
too many gadgets and too many plastic components.
too much unnecessary nerdism in everything today.
touch screen menus. wanna change the temperature?
well, that's a very sad true things you ever said
what do modern cars and fast food have in common?
why do you buy new when you don't have the money?
why i drive a 92 volvo and 94 mustang. obd i ftw.
wow, you are so negative, dude, even more than me
you have too much money in your bank account! !!!
1991 nsx, still i have more equipment than i need.
90's jdm for life. whap pap pap pap on, mah dudes.
aren't the new tesla cars updating their software?
but you'll spend $2.00+ for a bottle of tap water.
cars are stupid and its also making people stupid!
create the problem so you can create the solution?
damn, i really hate today's technology and luxury.
great video, great point of view. i totally agree.
grow some balls and learn to fix stuff like a man.
he said like 2 things and still disagreed with you
headlight 214$ what the hell. is it signing batman
how about just put back some money here and there?
i drive a 2008 e92 and the idrive still works good
i pay for my car less than fixing that 2016 honda.
if you can not buy a new car., buy an old good one
interesting video. too many problems, no solutions
it could be legit if you complain about 400k cars.
lol my dad has a old car and has so much problems!
oh, must buy newer and newer stuff eh. consumerism
one word that solves almost everything, insurance.
people using electronics to do everything for them
sound like an old man that can't handle new things
the heat on the lcd systems is going to kill them.
these problems are far outweighed by the benefits.
they last about 6 years. better to drive a beater.
u think they gona fix those in a firmware upgrade?
what's all that white stuff on the ground outside?
why does it say diarrhea tips on the touch screen?
your words truly reach me on an emotional level '-
all so damned true. people better wake up and fast!
and “a” pillars a foot wide that block your vision.
and what about those strong headlights blinding us?
another reason why i'am happy i own a 2000s mustang
baby boomers from the 50s fucked the econony for us
buy base models without all the extra shit included
d'arcy carden should play celine dion in a bio -pic
extremely silly video that i cannot take seriously.
get rid of touch screens in cars, absolute hazards!
go buy a car in norway before you start complaining
i could buy a 100k car but i have no need for that.
i don't like the whole communist ideologies in this
i drive a 1999 van with wind up windows, its great.
i liked it but i dont want it on my playlist dammit
i mis a car that you drive instead of all the cushy
i'm going to check,. i'd wager you're full of shit!
if you can't afford it, don't buy it. end of story.
imo, cost is not the worst thing about modern cars!
late 80´s to early 2000´s. don´t buy anything else.
learning how a car works sure helps when you drive.
lease it for 3 years and hand it back to the dealer
make it simple and affordable. now that would sell.
maybe i will keep my 1987 crown victoria after all.
more ppl. should join the darkside-get a motorcycle
never gonna buy a new car, pre millenium cars only!
no car should have touch screen. should be illegal.
no problem. i purchase a new auto every five years.
only problem is that you can't find parts for them.
skip the preachy intro and you'd have a good video.
slikdarelic have any of you guys ever heard of jdm?
small windows so you have to buy a reversing camera
so true, those shit looks fancy but totally useless
stop whining that you don't have enough money then!
talk about distractions. so much shit to play with!
thats why base models are nice. just the basics bro
thats why pays to learn how to do your own repairs.
the first bill civic 2006 results in 967, not 1364.
there are enough distractions on the road as it is.
there is a car for all budgets, cant aford hig end?
this guy looks like vsauce michael. michael stevens
this is sad. the only solution is to buy older cars
too much shit in cars. when does a car become a car
too much shit in this cars. thats why i love my e39
tuned in for insight, tuned out for all the whining
we need the cars like back in the 50s, 60s and 70s!
what's why when the warranty is out i get rid of it
why would you even buy a modern car i don't get it!
yes, capitalism is the main problem of modern cars.
you 100% correct, but it dosent mean you are right.
you are waaay ahead of your time this is brilliant!
you can buy the basic model of just about every car
you never have to worry about that life time fluid!
you're right. capitalism sucks. good video too btw.
you’re right but there’s nothing we can do about it
a very true perspective i haven't thought of before!
all he said is pretty much up to the driver to avoid
are you sure you didn't mean atleast 4 to 5 decades?
but you should be thankful you have that bitchin hat
buy a book on the car and tools and fix it yourself!
dont worry civic 2016 will cost 1364$ to fix in 2026
hi. in what year or decade then should we buy a car?
i also, believe in santa claus and the easter bunny!
i am still using 1987 golf mk2 as a daily driver lol
i got a volvo v40 t4 year 1998 and is perfetc for me
i have a 20 year old car and it's a opel astra g lol
i like your neutrality on the subjects you speak of.
i pay rm2400 month for a 2011 car for a 9 year loan.
i thought tesla's update their vehicle os regularly?
i totally agree, the more tech, the more to go wrong
if the battery goes flat, it wont shift out of park.
in singapore a toyota camry costs 150,000 us dollars
it's a total writeoff the vast majority of the time!
its called planned obsolescence and its a load of bs
modern cars are shit. ugly too. i only own old cars.
much less, a new car on the cheaper end of new cars?
much of what this guy said has a lot of truth in it.
never buy a new car. unless you just won the lottery
no one told me about those $85 gadgets in my wheels!
nothing fancy, just a box with 4 wheels and a motor!
rhey fucking us bad, they just say go make money yo!
shouldn't it be gauge cluster and not guage cluster?
solution to problem 1 buy a used car. like, no shit.
the auto makers will be forced to cut this shit out.
the worst thing about modern videos is the swearing.
this is why i buy 90s cars. they were better anyway.
this video sounds like a fucking cymbalta commercial
we need to go back to the 1st generation musclecars.
well, i am 62 the last new car i bought was in 1991!
what if your warranty covers it if it does go wrong?
what's up with the diarrhea tips. on the console at?
you are complaining about prices of cars in the usa?
you can replace infotainment system with aftermarket
you can't add bud the 2006 civic cost 967$ to repair
you should not criticize modern day cars in any way!
and wtf is it with no option to even go with no tech?
aren't most used budget cars 14k and below?.,, eeeesh
buy a 15 year old used car, fix it up. problem solved
buy base model cars that don't have any of that shit.
buy used and buy honda toyota. what are repair bills?
drivers aids are a great thing especially for seniors
im keeping my car till warrenty is gone then goodbye!
since when an average consumer can afford a 40-grand?
so the moral of the video is to not buy a modern car?
super expensive and super ugly. make mine old school!
tanks such as the volvo 240, the mercedez of the 80s?
thank you, thank you, thank you. did i say thank you?
that apple tastes pretty good. modern cars are great!
that's the dumbest video i've seen in a looong while.
that’s a really laggy and screw up volvo touch screen
thats why i have an old car with not much electronic!
thats why i love my good old trust polo 86c from ´92.
the most important reason is the old cars have style!
their only commitment is to add to their bottom line.
this is dumb. you can't afford a car, so they're bad?
this is why bugatti doesnt put displays in their cars
this went from interesting to idiotic in 0.6 seconds.
throw away is right. we live in a throw away society.
toyota hilux 80`s 90`s old mercs old vw`s easy to fix
try a 1992 civic vx- a c, heat, and an 92 horsepower.
uhh. what is going to go wrong with your touchscreen?
what happened to being able to buy a new car for 1500
why does electronics breaking have to be the default?
yes ppl do not realize these things in the beginning.
you dont have to buy a new car. buy used one instead.
$50 is plenty. can complete a shop with £20 on average
8 minutes to say cars are too expensive and high tech.
as long as it works its fine, why would i buy new one?
bout as well off to get an 80s car lol, low to no tech
but i understand his point he is trying to state here!
chery rich go buy it it's cheap probably spent i wrong
does anyone even make cars without this stuff anymore?
easy fix for problem 1. dont buy cars you cant afford.
gauge not guage. a great deal of sense is spoken here.
get a tesla model 3. technology not a problem in that.
i dont buy anything made with obdii. screw modern shit
i feel like the wheel isn't even attached to anything!
i'm in my 30's now and i still can't afford a new car.
if you know what you’re doing you can easily afford it
lol i got an ad for a tesla model before on this video
most people don't care about what this guy has to say!
my 1991 foxbody coupe looking real good right now lol.
my 2010 toyota is pretty basic. no touch screen. 5spd.
new cars with there small engines and turbos are wack!
oh, and paid cash. america, stop with the debt issues!
old cars are real cars, and modern cars are fake cars!
probably. would it maximize these companies's profits?
school has become a place to get robbed, not educated.
so. should i stick with buying a car not made in 2018?
some say by 2030 it’s game over for many manufacturers
still relevant in 2018. not getting any better. sadly.
the biggest problem with modern cars homes overpriced!
the greatest evil is the simulated analog digital dash
they want u enslaved a good car offers to much freedom
this is the price people pay for planned obsolescence.
well said sir and because you make sense, i subscribed
would it be silly to have 4 bed lengths aside from 8'?
you are complaining about luxury cars being expensive?
you know there are cars that cost less than 40k right?
and,, for that reason,, i like my 97 mazda 3000 pickup!
biggest problem is that they are not a supra or a ae 86
buy a car from 2003-2010 price problem solved, dumbass.
buy a used car for 5-6k jesus people are literally dumb
electronic assisted power steering is a massive hazard!
especially if you don't want all the electronic gizmos?
finally someone said what needed to be said. thank you.

greatest car i've ever owned. 1987 chevrolet camaro rs.

savagegeese, what you shared are my sentiments exactly!
thank you for exposing the problem without the solution
that random all out throttle with traction loss at tho?
the biggest problem with modern cars is modern drivers.
the biggest problem with modern cars there ugly as shit
the truth hurts. 30k for a basic car new is ridiculous.
they could've gotten in the fast lane or reduced speed.
they really should ban touch screen interfaces in cars.
this actually makes sense. thanks for making this video
try owning a bmw or mercedes in australia and singapore
u really think u find good places to eat while driving?
what 20 somethings are driving 15 thousand dollar cars?
what about gas vs electric running + maintenance costs?
what everyone need is a land rover defender. obviously.
where are you getting $40k for your average family car?
where the fuck are you paying $40,000 for a family car?
why buy a 40000$ car when cheaper models are available?
why the hell these guys don't have 10 million subs yet!
wtf so right about touch screens. they need taking out.
you appreciate what you have and maintain it with love.
you know what the real problem with modern day cars is?
absolutely nailed it. why people buy these is beyond me.
at last a sensible man. an american too. how delightful?
but there was too much soot on the inside windscreen lol
cars are a lot safer today how much is that worth to you
cheap eazy fun but most of all great for the enviroment.
finally someone shares my exact thoughts and expierences
fix one thing, another breaks backing it out of the bay.
i drive pre-1970 and i'm happy and my wallet is thicker.

problem is they are too expensive for modern sallaries😎
so your complaint boils down to incompetence and apathy.
thank you for sharing your opinion. it was entertaining.
thank you. i overlooked how damaging these aspects were.
this video is pessimistic as holy hell. is it expensive?
what was the point of bring the mechanic into the video?

i love my 2004 tsx. power steering and no bullshit screen
let's go back to carburators and mechanical distributors.
most of his arguments are wrong. you want expensive tech?
our vehicles are giant paper weights if the battery dies!
people driving $40,000 cars with a $20,000 budget salary!
regarding car technology. always research before you buy!
tesla is the poster boy of the technolization of the car!
that’s why so many people lease. 3 years and you are out!
the best way to keep us safe is to remove ads off youtube
they put that shit on vehicles because idiots will buy it
this makes me understand that the crown vic is a good car
wait. are you complaining that a luxury suv is expensive?
what about just getting a car without all these features.
what car is that with that slow ass response touchscreen?
why you should buy a tesla, they always update their cars
you, sir, have just earned yourself a new subscriber 👍🏼
1458 people eighter don't do math or has way to much money
300 worth of underwear shitting myself lol. all facts tho!

don't you have volume up down button on the steeringwheel?
fly by wire steering on a new hyundai or kia is the worst!
folks pls know this video is so full of lies and bullshit!
fuck i love modern gaming, but modern cars can go to hell.
hence always buy a used car…even a year old as good as new
i always wished car companies would re release older cars.
i go for old cars i don't like new unless i can go for one
i love my 97 civic. all manual parts and cheap to replace.
i only need a manual gearbox and no extra bullshit please.
i see there being a huge resale value for older cars soon.
i think the better they make technology the worse it gets.
i'm curious. what year or era do you define as modern car?
junk was in the trunk at one time now it’s the entire car.
loser. if you can't afford a car, don't buy one and bitch.
my cell phone is about ten years old and i'm fine with it.
or hopefully one of spacecraft enginers will live nearby??
sorry, but this video is retarded and you are a douchebag.
technology. its the best part. its the worst part. no way!
the comments are full of my kind of people. old cars rule!
the problem with modern cars. their to damn expensive lol!
the truth of your video is your obviously anti capitalist!
the u.k. likes this video. spot on because of common sense
the ultimate con game get working people in debt for life!
this is why toyota never updates its vehicle, reliability.
what about planned obsolescence of the mechanical systems?
what the fuck does savageese have to do with the video 👀?
when u realize your mechanic buddy doesn't listen for shit

i drive a 94 accord, can’t wait till i can buy a newer car.
i understand his point about technology, but let's be fair.
i'm just gonna buy an mr2 for a few thousand bucks instead.
if not do not buy it. can you drive and adjust your volume?
inserting cassettes in the 80s, cds in the 90s etc etc etc?
mabey its good the prices are this high, the emission sucks
makes a $42,000 car look positively sensible in comparison!
okay, you've presented valid problems what is the solution?
once i make more money i'm going to get a mercedes e class!
one could feel thus know exactly what and how the grip was!
only just came across this video. still absolutely spot on.
people with breathing difficulties in cities hate all cars!
plenty of reasonable 1000usd cars just learn how to fix em!
that video should be used as an advert to buy a new morgan.
thats why i got a 8 year 120k mile warranty on my focus st.
the biggest problem with modern cars is when an emp strikes
this is why i'm only going to buy vehicles made before 2008
this vid is right on. i'm sharing this with all my friends.
this video scared me now i kinda regret buying a new car 😒
which is exactly why i'd never buy any car made after 1990.
why are your head lights and wipers controlled by a module?
a very realistic, eye opening perspective. love your videos!
and that's why dacia exists. sometimes simple is just better
couldn't agree more. love getting into a 80s or 90s vehicle.
didn't like the service, so he stabbed the guy in the chest.
finally someone that gets how stupid technologie is in cars!
guys pls give a awnser with a car that a can buy with 40000$
holy crap. the news story you used is my local news station.
i daily drive 1999 rx300 lexus, still in pristine conditions
i drive a 2000 jeep grand cherokee and it's still running 💪
i get what he's saying about the price, but the tech is fine

met my mistress are you for real or is that a freudian slip?
or get a tesla and get lifetime updates to all the software.
so buy second hand car men want are saying bruh stupid video
so you can complain, but what's the solution to the problem?
so you're basically saying the technology isn't good enough.
soooo nobody is gonna mention the mechanic that got stabbed.
that's how capitalism works. then may i recommend a trabant?
the answer to all the whining in every second of this video?
the idea is to use the touchscreen while you're not driving.
the market is speaking. you just don't wanna fucking listen.
the paradox of technological advancement is a vicious cycle.
the vibe of the video is that of someone delivering a eulogy
this is why i drive a 69 cadillac. no bullshit just comfort!
vehicles now seem to be throw-aways, as well as other items.
you can even use aux cord for talking if you really want to.
you pay money each month, end up with nothing and that's ok?
100% tesla, could you imagine having to replace that battery?
and if your camera or park assist breaks learn parking a car.
and this is why you should buy older vehicles such as datsuns
bravo. well done. too much crap to use and later have to fix!
buy a 2016 fwd explorer for less than $20,000. goddamn. also?
come to australia. cars are almost double what americans pay.
do people not understand that software doesn't can't break???
easy solution, get a vega or a pinto. free market capitalism.
forget about cars and use public transportation all the time?
ha ha. you need to take your hand off the wheel, so what man?
heated and cooled seats is another worthless costly accessory
i may see things differently from now on having watched this!
i mean, why the hell do you need to complicate simple things?
i only got $50 dollars to survive on. midaswell buy twinkies!
i think most of what you shared is bogus. cars are expensive?
i've never purchased a new car in my life, i'm not the silly.
if she needs a family car for the kids she best be working 😂
in my opinion its the weight of the cars that's the bad thing
it doesn't make sense. you know what the problem actually is?

man, buy yourself real food. your shopping cart makes me cry.
modern cars are overpriced, over complicated and, well. crap.
modern cars cost money most people my age 20's just dont have
my biggest wish is that volvo would build a new designed 740!
my car was $120k and it definitely does hurt when shit breaks
my wife’s 2017 accord ex is the epitome of infotainment evil!
people are crying like they're forced into optional features.
sounds like you're just bitching about not having much money.
spot on great vid soooo true and sooo many crooked mechanics!
thats why its great to be a car enthusiast, we know whats up.
the driver assist tech could be replaceable like a car radio.
the second part of that question is where i'm having trouble.
they sh*t all over everything and chase little kids in parks!
we have old cars we will stay with old cars old cars for life
what car are you using that let's you use yelp while driving?
evil car makers put touchscreens and safety features in my car
get with progress dude or get left out. it’s the fact of life.
good luck with the maintenance. get the grant touring package?
have you ever seen the repair price tag on a rear ended lexus?

i want fuckin nobs for my hvac and stereo. fuck touch screens!
if you can’t pay cash for the car, you can’t afford it. simple
im never buying a ice car again, to much parts that can break.
keeping my sixteen year old toyota avalon as long as possible.
love the depressed tone of the video. it really sets the mood.
one short circuit and your whole electronics could be damaged!
physical buttons better than touch inputs of any kind function
problem 1 and 2 can be solved by settling for a cheap new car.
remember the days when you had buttons called bass and treble?
second hand would be a common way to go for which makes sense.
solution don't buy a new $45k car buy a $5000-10,000 used car.
sooooo true. i can't believe the mechanic is that brainwashed.
that's why bmw have such low resale value too expensive to fix
the core of capitalism create a problem and selll a solution!.
these car will get easily hacked because of non updated system
these cars are not going to last. this man speaks my language!
this doesn't seem like a problem with cars but with capitalism
this is exactly why i keep a couple of my old school vehicles!
this is why i like electric cars. they almost never break down
who car repair such kind of technology after lets say 7 years?
why do i need a phone in the car, i have bluetooth on my cell.
yet you see tons of new cars on the street. so whats the deal?
you are so right that these cars are more throwaway than ever.
you can fix and maintain that little bugger with a socket set.
you had me at go through 300$ in underwear shitting myself, 😂
youre not supposed to fix it, youre supposed to buy a new one!
a person is not able to look after----maybe only an oil change?
about to drop 10gs into an 80s bmw with almost 200k miles on it
crappy plastic headlight fixtures that fade, scratch and crack.
dont by anything from europe or american buy japanese or korean
how is it legal to put a touch screen that controls everything?
i agree 100%. remember being that back yard mechanic years ago?
i agree. new cars are nice but expensive to drive and maintain.
i cant afford that so fuck it thats why im still rocking my 06!
i drive a 1997 mitsubishi. i'm happy with old technology really
i hate start buttons on new cars. i like the classic key better
i like your video but it sounds like your scaring people a bit.
i really hate touch screens on cars. i want knobs and switches!
i think the biggest problem is the fact that you're a tight ass
if you're spending $40,000 on a hyundai, you're doing it wrong.
man up, do some research, and learn how to work on it yourself.
no organization no nothing this world needs to ger the fuck up!
only good at first. when it fails, time to bring in more bucks!
so work towards a better job to be able to afford a better car?
some modern cars are good. i love the newer mercedes benz cars!
the injector di is 5 times as expensive according to the costs.
the problem is that you forget how often your older cars failed
the problem with cars is they have 4 wheels. ride a motorcycle.
the public always gets what it wants. do you wan't safe brakes?
too much technology and electronic emergency brake is the worst
totally and only agree with the touch screen part in this video
vehicle breakdowns hit record high in u.s. despite new car tech
what is wrong with this fucking world with all this safety crap
why the hell cant you just get a used car like a normal person?
you don't understand modern america which imho is good for you!
you nailed it.capitalism.the ridiculous emphasis on the stack .
you spend more time looking at the lcd than you do at the road!
20, got a 2916 wrx, now in a 2019 wrx. always with my own money.
anyone notice the error in parts total for the 2006 honda civic?
butt load of electrical stuff into an automobile, kills d charm.
buy a toyota and you won't have to spend money on labor or part.
can’t believe how much they charge for plastic in cars nowadays.
cars need to be abolished and replaced by star trek transporters
first reason all that crap isnt going to work in five years lool
glad i want to buy that 1971 cadillac for $3,900 when i'm older.
here a soultion don't buy a fucking brand new car buy a used one
i bet my 1989 crx will outlast most modern cars on the road now.
i don't get why young people buy new cars before buying a house.
i don’t like that you can easily put aftermarket radios nowadays
i have the same sentiment regarding modern household appliances!
i just prefer to fix up an older car that's simpler and cheaper.
i like the idea of a tesla car, but i could never live with one.
i mean, who wants the latest and greatest safety features right?
i see the point and you are right about modern cars being shitty
i've never used a touchscreen in a car that wasn't a laggy mess.
its sad when they throw away a simple switch for a touch screen.
just buy an el camino, like me and drive around looking awesome.
like are you wrecking your car every time you need a light bulb?
moral of the story, dont take crappy courses at the uni college.
my biggest problem with a new modern car is the monthly payment.
no one is pulling a gun to your head and telling you to buy car.
oh, let's not talk about buttons going fubar. but a touchscreen?
ohhh and the feel and feedback of their hand wheels was perfect!
planned obsolescence is what they're doing to modern cars. #yuck
rear view cameras should be the only technology feature on cars.
speaking as a retired auto mechanic, i will never buy a new car!
the biggest problem of today. everyone whinges about everything.
the shit touchscreens and the lack of solid axel and leafsprings
the time that someone would buy a new car for 10+ years is over.
what a empty video. since when the car on the us are expensive??
what's bogus is this penis head trying to make money off youtube
who will risk to buy such a used technology junk after 10 years?
why don't you buy a 2 year old one that's almost half the price?
you got a subscriber. i completely agree with you on this video.
you know, they have these touch screen systems in airplanes too?
you might have some issue with your car, need to get that fixed.
a thought, do one on tv adds like going bald and lose weight ect.
and then come autonomous vehicles with all the hard and software.
car tech sucks. whatever happened to a simple cd player or radio?
did anyone else notice the screen on the volvo said diarhea tips?
driving a modern car its like dating a gold digger. that's a fact
dude, what kind of douche expects to have a $40k car in his 20's?
great, a commie that can't hide his seething hate for capitalism.
he stabbed the mechanic because he didn't like the service. what.
hell, might as well buy a big rig then. stupid people these days.
i 💜 my 11 year old rust bucket that runs with carburetor 4g13 😁
i have tesla model for 2 weeks and had 2 software updates already
i mean get with the times, honda, toyota, lexus, bmw, tesla, etc.
i'm sure there aren't any updates for the technology in that car.
im still for the old school tech for cars. except for the engine.
key word family car. it's meant for a family with a stable income
latinos auto shop, stabbing, getaway bicycle is anyone surprised?
maybe drive something that doesn't cost so much or is not loaded?
modern cars are so much cheaper than 20 years ago its ridiculous.
needless to say, i don't have that new plastic junk pile anymore!
oh bloody hell ,yer getting old ,you need a good running 75 pinto
really old concept. you just being too old to adopt technologies.
spot on. the tech will break. wtf do we need touch screen aircon?
test have shown that the safer you feel, the more risks you take!
that scene in the infotainment system depends on the fucking car.
the biggest problem with modern cars is that i can't afford them.
the greatest trouble with modern cars is fwd. torque steer sucks.
there's always good old planned obsolescence. thanks auto makers!
they're trying to rob us blind like we can't tell piss from rain.
this guy is a complete fucking idiot. stay home or ride a bicycle
thnx bro,i feel d same way too about modern cars n i luv old cars
tl dw they're boring, expensive to buy and expensive to maintain.
try dave ramsay's drive free for anyone looking into the comments
what a bs, please dude don´t own a car you are not even worth it.
you video is also capitalism so people don’t buy these newer cars
your and everybody elses problem.lower your standards. quit cryin
a car is nothing more than a means to get from point a to point b!
a quick glance i can tell the total is closer to 1000$ than 1360$.
all the good 10 yr old cars getting crushed under scrappage scheme
am i the only one that noticed 'diarrhea tips' on the touchscreen?
and no service manual or parts available for any diy tesla owners!
de la soul opening, just missing ”sorry, you can’t get through” 😉
every car over 2004 will never get a classic because of technology
get a crown victoria it has very little problems that can go wrong
good analysis. you should change your name to intensegeese instead
hard to know about which one, where it's at and how to replace it.
here are a few reasons i believe car manufacturers are doing this.
his answer. that's in case you fall asleep and drift across lanes!
holy shit @ that volvo touchscreen lag tesla suffers from this too
i agree car industry needs to offer software and hardware updates!
i can sum up what the problem is in three words too much bullshit.
i don't buy new vehicles. i pay cash for my vehicles. i have four.
i genuinely don't know if i really like or really hate this video!
i think $10,000-$15,000 is the optimal price range for a used car.
i want whats necessary and a little bit of extra for style points.
i will stick with my 1967 corvette, 1970 blazer 4x4, 1971 pu truck
if the public stopped buying all this shite they wouldn't make it.
its not so hard. get an old car from a decent maker, that is basic
never drive a car when you can not even change a simple light bulb
on your first problem just buy a cheaper one, quite simple really!
savageg dropping wisdom like a veteran. fuck planned obsolescence.
stupidest video i have seen today. somebody's trapped in the past.
super distracting impossible to navigate without looking laggy ui!
tesla cars get free over air updates for the full life of the car.
tesla updates the software on their infotainment systems regularly
that's why i wouldn't buy a brand new car even if could afford it.
the problem with technology is that when it breaks… you're fucked!
they all look the same- the sheeple generation cars. infotainment?
trust me america is nothing compared to denmarks pricetag on cars.
very nice video, this is where the drawback of capitalism exposed.
welcome to the america nightmare or is it dream what they call it?
yeah i think i keep my 17 years old bmw with no digital shit in it
yeah, remember the good old days when we hand cranked our engines?
yes, loaded with electronic junk that has no relevance to driving.
you are bang on my friend. bravo to you for telling it like it is.
you can't search for a restaurant in a honda while you're driving.
you cannot do simple arithmetic. the list on the left totals $967.
65 mustang gt coupe. best ever and completely mechanical. go figure
because ppl who build it tell us we should be proud of it. i'm not.
cars are the worst investment. why burn $40,000 on a brand new one.
give me a ‘93 12 valve dodge and i’ll drive that baby to the grave!
governments push up price of cars. regulations and taxes on dealers
hopefully pandora exists in 7 years or it's gonna be quiet driving.
i 2016 civic would almost certainly still be under warranty, moron.
i always wanted a newer car. i kinda just want something older now.
i went from a modern bmw to a 1990 miata for one reason, simplicity
if bluetooth is broken, that doesn’t work. but who needs it anyway?
in eastern europe. the average person waits ten years to get a car.
it seems like on the newer cars one thing goes out it all goes out.
just give me a 1993 mk4 supra. modern enough for me and plenty fast
lmao stop bitching you clearly flip bugers working 12 hours a month
my next car is going to be a 1965 or 1966 ford mustang convertible!
my problems with modern cars are that most of them are ugly as shit
no comments from me on that since it is so subjective. electronics?
no rubber floors, metal dash and manual steering, brakes & windows?
technology is the best part of modern cars, dislike for this video.
technology part of your story is just crap. i agree with the costs.
that is what liberalism does. we are too busy paying for deadbeats.
thats why i have an 28 year old, vw t3 doka. greetings from germany
the biggest problem with modern cars plastic headlights fog lights!
the only car manufacturer that maintains their software is tesla 😳
there are plenty of vehicles without what you're complaining about.
there piling all this technology into these new cars because of us!
they should bring back the vw bug. cheap to buy, own, and maintain.
who are those fucking idiots disliked this great informative video?
why do people try to buy a new car then expect the price to be low?
why is everyone using technology to refer to electronic stuff only?
you can can't even do engine swaps on modern cars due to technology
you could even 'custom order' a car made to your exact preferences?
a steering wheel sticking out of the door and pedals on the ceiling?
and this is why i drive 90's honda's. simple fun and easily repaired
apple car play and android auto are great ideas and they get updates
back to basic and just the technology that is needed to meet to law!
buy a toyota, they last longer than you ever will be able to live xd
car brand put safety features. but the touchscreen is not very safe.
cost $3800 do you have a hybrid lexus and its one of the early ones?

i have a peugeot 206. and i had it for almost 10 years. and its shit
i like my 2012 civic, the last generation without all that problems.
i wish i could hit thumbs up 100 times. i can't agree with you more!
if cars had a built in flesh light we would never have to leave them
mate come to australia and tell me about the cost of your cars in us
modern cars rape their drivers of all their privacy and information.
my car is now an up to date, ever changing navigation and media god!
o boy i would hate to have to adjust the volume with a touch screen.
or being liberal lower middle class who doesn't know how to survive?
poor visibility. i hate the sloped cabin, with the tiny rear window.
regarding your first point new cars have never been more affordable!
stick to a good pre 80's hunk of metal. nothing like driving a tank!
that infotainment system is laggy af, thats unacceptable for any car
the only technology i need for my auto is gps and handsfree to call.
the safest feature of any car is a spike in the middle of the wheel.
there's a simple solution to all these problems. just buy a classic!
wait till you see the prices in singapore. $40k for a brand new car?
wasn't it dangerous tuning a radio with a knob in the 50s, 60s, 70s?
what can you say in that review that requires that level of urgency?
you.re funny blaming capitalism for expensive cars, no its socialism
$40k on a car that will be worth $18k at the end of the 60 month note
and while teslas are packet with tech, they get updates all the time.
bankers love debt and they are the biggest lobbyist in washington dc.
best reviewer on youtube. keep up the honesty and i'll keep watching.
disposable,goverment- manufacturer schemes to keep factories running.
don’t buy a car that has less than 30k miles that’s like half he cost
dont basic packages for cars often skip the infotainment and cameras?
however i do agree it should not been barred from not having updates!
i bought brand new volvo s60 r design 1 year ago and cant be happier.
i cannot agree with anything more in life than i can with this video.
i completely agree with you about technology, problems and solusions.
i own a toyota and a honda no problems. also a ford f150 no problems.
i'll fuckin drive my golf 3 until the end of time i don't give a shit
i'm just gonna buy a new base model honda civic and fuck off with it.

problems with modern cars are reflecting problems with modern society
this guy is literally the most boring person i have ever encountered.
this middle aged whiny bitch sucks at making videos of any substance.
this needs more views thank you man so true everything you went over.
very curious to see how the author of this article would rate a tesla
well, i think this goes beyond cars, this goes to everything in life!
what i don't like about new cars, i have to wear sunglasses at night.
what's with manufacturers still putting vanity mirrors on the visors?
why all this crap in a car that only needs to go from a-to-b on land?
why didn't minivans have sliding doors on both sides before air bags?
you are plain right, said to say so, but i wish my mb w124 e300 back.
and you shouldn't be driving if your not paying attention to the road!
buying, maintaining and fixing cars takes crazy money. it's all a scam
can’t relate. i’m 21 just bought a 2017 mustang. not struggling at all
cars look like shit nowadays. they have all lost their original looks.
dude. i know it is late 2016… but did you heard about voice searching?
expensive and dangerous killing more people than drive by's in chicogo
good thing my c6 corvette is build with all the technology of the 50s!

literally all they needed was a good integrated dock for a smartphone.
not much. and what's the point of increasing the horsepower each year?
or even fix it myself. you want to know what the real issue with tech?
pay cash for you car. never go in to debt for a fast depriciating car.
speaking of which, maybe do a video on how annoying most cars are fwd!
thank you for this refreshing message. btw. still rocking my iphone 4s
thats why i like my old 2004 camry, very reliable and easy to maintain
the problem with technology is manufacturers don't commit to updates??
there is a lot of truth in this video. much of it. we rather not hear.
this is a very sad person this video made me sad but damm he is right.
this is why i will hold on to my 2002 4runner for as long as possible.
this video is absolutely ridiculous. i don't even know where to start.
wait so if the screen dies you can’t control any features in the car??
we need dependable transportation, not a home of the future on wheels.
welp. watching this after just purchasing a 2018 mercedes benz c300 🤭
you seriously did not just use a car calculator to make a point right?
your right we do not need computers on cars. you only need your phone.
all technology is great. until it fails, or breaks. especially in cars.
because of the lobby regulations so we are stuck with all of this crap!
chris campel same i need to be interactive with my car.push starts suck
deleting the obscenities always makes for a more enjoyable documentary.
good luck you all. oh ps its mint or close and i paid 4000 for it lmfao

i go to gym i eat right. for those complaining why so expensive to fix?
i rather buy a old car and put moden gadget cost cheaper in the lng run
i stabbed my mechanic one time. hey in my defense he was so f-ing slow!
i understand your point with this video, but what are the alternatives?
i wonder why these type of videos wont go away from the suggested list.
it must be all the new car dealer sales people that give a thumbs down!
its dangerous for lot of reasons when to use all of them driving alone.
lol. that's why car repair shops popping out like mushrooms after rain.
manufacturers are breaking the first law of engineering keep it simple!
so much technophobia and nostalgia going on in this video and comments.
that laggy touchscreen would make me want to push the thing off a cliff
these are standard fixtures, not optional extras. i just want to drive.
this is why i buy used. if you can't pay cash, you can't afford the car
too much electronic shit that no one knows how to fix. gimme a 70s car.
um look alice. i can even set the temperature to 68-degs on this lexus!
very good. cars are cooler now than ever and you make very valid points
what about the incredibly stupid & dangerous trend on autonomous drive?
what are the best least technological car models that will last longer?
whine fuckin whine. when did you last keep a pc or a phone for 7 years?
your distaste for capitalism is blatantly evident and ruins the videos.
100 % agree price is way way out inspace. yet ignorant buyer buy it.omg!
ahaha and these cars still don't got the balls to keep up to my old shit
ay nigga time is changing, u better move with it or get run d fuck over.
bovine feces. make that 30 years or 300,000 miles, whichever comes last!
capitalism also works when you choose not to buy these features, commie.
don’t use the car loan calculator. it’s not reality. go to a dealership.
even if you make that money somehow. earning money isn't a mystery dude.
holy shit dude some of those shots at the start of the video are amazing
i am going to buy an older car, possibly something fro the 40's or 50's.
i just laugh when people keep telling me you need to get a new car, why?
i love my 23 y.o car as i love my 7 y.o phone. no need to change at all.
i still love my buick roadmaster rides better than any new car out there
i'm keeping a 1992 vw corrado vr6 alive and kicking 3 years going strong
jesus christ, there actually are people who think leasing a car is good?
new cars are stuffed with a bunch of crap electrics that are a time bomb
or so the dealer and many youtube videos said. so much for home repairs!
or that buying a brand new vehicle is the only option for a 20 year old?
personally outside of the radio i don't want to see electronics in cars.
planned obsolecence is the answer. and electric cars will be even worse.
that is the reason why i'm driving my 20 years old car bought as new car
thats not problems with modern cars, thats problems with modern society.
the 12 year old idrive system is a great example of outdated technology.
the more things that you put into a car, the more things that can break.
the problem is, you don't know how the development of a modern car work.
they will shut you down, or your views will drop. keep up the good work!
well get a car without a touchscreen then. i don't see the problem here.
yea soon there is almost cheaper to buy a new car then repair a new car.
yeah, pal, i think we're all aware of the little thing called inflation.
you can't stop technology buddy. pretty soon cars will drive themselves.
you mentioned 40k for a car. how about a 2017 altima 2.5 sr new 22k otd?

you will to take your eyes off the road to make adjustments to anything., even to check your speed
agree with you. but with that said auto companies do offer trim levels to avoid all the extra cost.
an odd video where people buy new cars they can't afford and that becomes the manufacturer's fault.
and thats why i own an old truck, the most modern thing in it is a cd player that i dont care about
bought my 98 chevy k1500 ext cab for 3500 paid it off in 5 months 17 years old no help from parents
cars and trucks need to be basic transportation, do nothing else, they all need to go back to 1969.
go to a used car dealership or craigslist and find something with a good track record for way less.
have you taken into account a 10 years period of usd inflation when calculating civic parts prices?
i am from singapore, try buying a car here. globally, considered the highest cost of car ownership.
i can look for a restaurant while driving, or you could not be an idiot and wait until your parked?
i could see companies sprouting up to make aftermarket control panels more old school in the future
i love compact cassette, but i've never seen a car with a cassette player and a touchscreen before.
i really do not understand the logic here. 1 you do not like new tech. buy the car without it then?
if a car wont drive 4 persons to their work from a - b, its not worth owning a car, car is a luxury
it’s not capitalism that’s the problem, it’s crony capitalism that’s the hugest problem world wide.
most of the people realize what they have bought. only when they get into a car shop for repairing.
my car left my bestie coughing while he was putting stuff in the trunk and i cold started the car d
so true, especially about cost. the dealerships charging 1000 on top of price just get a car to you
taking a tiny ass pos engine too small for the car and slapping a turbo on it to make it tolerable.
that so damn true in 06 i bought a brand new nissan titan for 21500. that same damn truck is 50000!
well about 10k -18k euros depending on the car size and brand. yeah. ever check a ford focus wagon?
you forgot to mention hybrids and how new full-size vans have the same bodystyle for over 20 years.
you know what new cars usually don't put any controls on touchscreens though sadly there are a few?
1500. just as an example. they're more reliable in my opinion if the previous owner took care of it.
also cost of touchscreen is cheaper then replacing 15 buttons. again, think about what youre saying.
bought a triumph spitfire in 1997, only costs 9,0 euro per month insurance. maintainance done by me.
but computer technology is good in most ways. autosteering, collision avoidance. machines save lives
i bought my first car when i was 37. i has relied on walking and public commute for school and work.
i had a roll down window, one metal key, carbureted 22-r, 4 spd toyota pick up. it was bullet proof.
i have a 2016 hyundai accent and thank god it doesn't really have much of these modern technologies.
i think of my car as my baby, not an appliance. its modern and it's a base model i love it to death.
it was rated at 48 mpg highway and 36 mpg around town. i always averaged 54 and 48 mpg respectively!
leave computers out of my goddamn car. give me a metal dashboard with round gauges and a carburetor.
my family car e36 sedan. for me the problem with new cars is that they are full of shit i dont need.
no hacker in the world can hack your normal radio or temperature settings with a normal push button.
no one really uses that much technology on a car, most of the time people are distracted by iphones.
no. but i can afford them with the limited budget i have. both in up front cost, and in maintenance.
nobody forced you to go to college. you can get a job in a trade and make good money by your mid 20s
or how bout when u know how to replace something but u have to remove extra stuff just to replace it
reliability is just bad business. the more things break the more money car manufacturers get. simple
so go drive a 70s chevvy, forego the tech and stop moaning about it. until you get to a gas station.
that laggy touchscreen almost gave me cancer. thank god that i have actual buttons to turn on my ac.
thats exactly shit i hate in modern cars. change climate control on touchscreen. is that innovative?
very good points. i agree with you. i can not understand those 1k people who did unlike this video?!
when you're getting so sick of your modern car you have to look up diarrhea tips on its touchscreen.
you only have yourself to blame if u buy a car you cant afford no one is forcing you to buy new cars
age 17-20 people should join the military, get ur car and free collage plus get paid. problem solved.
because i know the gizmos are the first thing to break and the last thing anyone wants to pay to fix.
capitalism is about capital. that's money. also, technology helps you keep your life and your health.
did he mention the flawed security with keyless entry, i got bored half way through and skipped a bit
i am glad that that i viewed this video before buying my next car. really didn't considered this view
i can even fix most problems myself. no computer, all mechanical. cheap to buy, register, and insure.
i have a 2013 and saw the same radio in a 2015 but with android auto and asked can i get that update?
i know my family members all have cars that they paid over 30,000 all bought new and only worth 5,000
i like the classic 90's 80's and 70's cars. no stupid gps, cruze mode crap, and manual transmissions!
i want my first car to be from 80s thats how i always wanted my first car to be, simple and reliable.
i'm 56 and i just don't know how 20 & 30 somethings either lease or own alllllllll those luxury cars!
i'm a young guy into tech but all i need in a car is an aux socket. buttons touchscreens all the way.
i'm an old dude in my early 60s. i can remember when a brand new 1969 corvette was a whopping $8,000!
i've been shopping for a new car for about a month. and iam so fcking sick of it al ready. holy shit.
in the uk getting a new car on personal contract hire for 48 months, resolves most of these problems.
interesting and relatable. cars should not be disposable, or at least be optionally disposable items.
it's no longer fun to drive, it's a worry if i will get to my destination and back home in one piece.
love this dude. thank you for this video. you have said everything ive been arguing with people about
most of the technology in today’s cars will not be repairable. anyone want to repair an old computer?
never bought a brand new car in my life. never will. such a terrible investment that just depreciates
not a good video. dude reminds me of old codgers who say well, they don't make 'em like they used to!
plus, about the update thing. i've had 4 firmware updates on my new car since i got it early january.
the dislikes come from the car manufacturer ceos and guys who are on their iphone apps while driving.
these are just a couple of the many reasons i will keep driving my 2003 mustang for a very long time.
we must have evolution if dont like my friend go buy 80's car, buy nokia 3210 phone, and macintosh pc
well, if you stop buying stupid stuff they stop making stupid stuff. that's how an open market works.
you can keep your bills as they come due while being enslaved to your own debtors. people are stupid.
your new car might be 99% safer in an accident but if only 1% of people can afford it what is the use
absolutely right. don't really care about technology anyway. thanks for this awesome review as always.
democrats the reason for unaffordable cars. well hell else do you fund government rape business owners
gets me like 30-40 mpg and the parts for it are so cheap. a good used engine for it is like 200 bucks!
good points, but. how do you--just you or just me or just someone else--solve your 2 biggest problems?
hey dumbass you don't need to tap the volume on the honda to change the volume. you slide your finger.
i got a 1964 falcon, it's starts every time, they can't track me, and my 10 year old could rebuild it!
i own a 2003 mazda protege5. in the center console, it has, what i presume is, a cigarette box holder?
i simply love this car, i don't want my next car to be anything other than a 2003-2007 ford focus zx3.
i think the apps from the touch screen should only be used by the passenger or when the car is stopped
i'm surprised the insurance industry doesnt put a stop to touch screen in cars. its insanely dangerous
is it possible to get a higher end version of a car toyota's xse or honda's touring without this tech?
it's a thing of the past exceptions are there naturally also do you realize why that tech is in there?
just buy a volvo 240, cheapto buy, built like a tank, easy and cheap to repair, no complex technology.
keep your old car. but if you must buy new, either lease it or trade it in after the warranty expires.
my first car was 900$, and the only electronics it had were in the cassette radio. never failed on me.
opened the video for te biggest problem,then he says there are two problems i don't have all that time
smh. technology is pure witchcraft and i love it but, sometimes it is a plague on the new generations.
still you can get a simple cars without any extra like touchscreens. you have to pay for your snobism.
that 2009 nokia looks pretty appealing, tbh. life would be so much quieter since nobody calls anymore.
the manufacturers real concern is not the vehicle they just made, rather the one that will replace it.
their biggest problem is over complication. look at the nsx, m4 gts, porsche 918, audi r8, and r35 gtr
well if they get hit by lightning they are pretty much fryed older cars on the other hand can be fixed
what about the fact that simple affordable sports cars are dying because of the takeover of crossovers
2006 civic only costs $967 for the parts list. goes to show new cars are twice as expensive to maintain
7 years without updates is ok for a $700 smartphone that you're going to throw away but not a $40k car.
a simple civic costs about 90k usd over here. we're all drooling at the prices of cars in your country.
and again, distracting lcd screens are extras, where you can actually save money if you dont want them.
and that's why i drive a base model corolla although they still had to put a touchscreen stereo in it .
cars today are the cheapest they have ever been compared wages. and safer. i'm sorry i gave this a view
damn modern cars with the phone button on the wheel reminding me i have no social life. fuck that shit!
do your research first don't just buy a car because it looks good buy a car what's fit your life style.
gasp, a 600$ a month payment, with 4 yrs included maintenance and like. 3$ cost per mile, yeah, not bad
i go to keep my 16 years old mitsubishi l200, it's very low tech, and never lets my down. with low cost
i hate the way manufacturers will only offer leather on the top end lines in the 20 to 30k automobiles.
i put an aftermarket android radio into my 8000$ old passat, now it can do more than a new 45000 passat
i swear that they put in blind spots in cars, so then they can install expensive blind spot monitoring.
if my windshield is fogging up, i don't wanna dig through arthritic menus to find the fan setting no.3!
if the sheeple didn't go for all these conveniences, a pay for them, they'd eventually get the message.
if you're buying a 15k car and get 12% interest and you do a 60 month term that's your own fault lmaooo
japanese manufactures are generally ahead in tech. gm, ford and chrysler simply don't have it down yet.
just one more reason to keep driving my very simple 2002 saturn sl2. dosent even have abs and i love it
many people consider the ferarri f40 to be the best car ever made. it’s got zero tech. fuck technology.
medicine the same they create the problem and show you like they found the solution to sell those pills
modern cars much easier to fix. plug it in. read the code. replace the part. done. no rebuilding carbs.
oh yeah, pre planned obsolescence. cars are nothing but manufactured grief. new cars are absolute junk.
so you were struggling to feed yourself and then you just were too horny to stop and got screwed. enjoy
the next automotive downturn is coming and it'll be based on what this guy's bitching about. just wait.
they're still not going to be able to afford a new car. so the manufacturers and the dealers will lose.
this is why i'm optimistic about electric cars in general. tesla is fixing both problems at the moment.
very narrow minded. we are moving to autonomy and that is where the focus is. you will see in 10 years.
you can still buy utilitarian vehicles. commercial vehicles don't have all the new technology packages.
you made some very good points here. just let me add that the gap in the market is a car like the yugo!
1990 commodore ss 225hp was 27000aud brand new ' 2017 commodore ss 47000aud. ss ute is cheaper 45000 aud
a 2002 wrx is barely cheaper than a 2018 one. cars have barely appreciated since the late 90s early 2ks.
about a month ago, i still owned a 1991 volkswagen gti mk2, it was my first car and i loved it to death!
cars are starting to reach perfection imo, now brands are putting unnecessary stuff in them just to flex
i have a 2004 bmw 5 series. for a 12 year old car it drives super smooth with very little problems. but!
i hear a lot of people saying to always buy used and never buy new, well, no one manufactures used cars!
it happens but i'd still rather have technology. i'm glad my climate controls aren't tied to the screen.
it was not uncommon to see the average american car break down within a year of it rolling off the line.
it's called free market asshole, do research before to u buy a car, and start with used work your way up
its called a warranty. especially showing a volvo is sad, they replace everything for free. research it.
just be glad you dont live in denmark, when you pay 40.000 for a car we pay 100 120.000 for the same car
modern cars are more efficient, safe, comfortable and yeah more reliable. you know what your problem is?
modern technology isn't bad but as long as theirs no self driving cars, that's basically ruining the car
old car, driver 90% take control, computer 10% rest modern car computer 90% take control driver 10% rest
pfft. that's so moronic. let's take a simpler example. we have a 2 and a 4. how much is 4 bigger than 2?
saying that they put tech to distract you so you end up in crash so they sell more safety is too cynical
someone needs to come out with a good car without all the shit that is roomy and has decent performance.
soo funny i came across this vid. going through the dilemma of looking at cars now. couldn't agree more.
the seats with massage in new mercedes have so many wires running on the inside you'd think it's a bomb.
this might be the most cinematically dramatic video i have ever seen that didn't involve abused animals.
too much garbage on cars these days. look at most car reviews these days. what do they start with first?
why would anyone want a little shitbox that smashes into undrivable scrap in as slow as a 35 mph impact?
you just made a 7 minute video of absolute bullshit. reality if you can't afford it don't fucking buy it
did the cable activated heat controls not work before sensors and servos and more little servos and such?
do what indians do. stay with your parents. oh wait, you shame people who stay with their parents, right?
does that mean people have no interest in buying houses because they can't afford a million dollar house?
fucking stop whining and get a bicycle, what a waste of time the last minutes, 😱fck u own me minutes now
get a job. 2 technology then you elaborate the only thing i have to say to that is lol, are you retarded?
i don't know about this, i bought a 2000 nissan pulsar n16, sentra to you yanks, what can i say about it?
if you can buy a tablet pc for less than $300, why does a touchscreen in a car still cost an extra $2500?
p 1 no need to buy it 2 no fuel costs 3 no yearly check-up costs 4 no car taxes 5 no car insurance costs!
the high tech electronics does not belong in the automobile environment, especially in low quality parts.
the worst thing about modern cars of the 2000's is the fact that all look samey and are totally soulless.
there are idiots. you can buy a basic car with absolutely nothing, there are many brand that have nothing
too complicated and unneccesary things embetted into them.better to have dash detachable to repair gauges
what isnt there, doesnt brake. the manufactuurers put them in so thez can justifz those super high prices
you can't even buy a toyota pickup anymore in barebones. not to mention all the cars keep getting fatter.
2016 jeep compass, $36000, monthly payment 8 years with a bank that doesn't trust you, $434 a month. deal!
bullshit effin review and senseless arguments, ten thumbs down, folks moved on from nokias and blackberry?
even the abs brakes piss me off in winter conditions, causing my brakes to lock up when they shouldn't be!
i ask that question all the time. how are people supposed to afford these cars especially suvs and trucks?
i couldnt agree with you more. that said, i'm gonna go ahead and buy that extended warranty next paycheck.
i drive a 12 year old toyota, and won't change until they pull their heads out of their infotainmentbutts.
i had a 90 ls400 lexus and what a rocket and comfortable. one big problem it was an electronic nightmare!!
i love how ur professional with ur vids and how u talk. but most importantly i love the random cuss words!
i love my 88 toyota pickup. so basic and manual everything. wish she had cupholders and a back seat though
i love the mini countryman we have my mom's car it has 125,000km it's 2013 one d model, and it is so good!
i think in the future, the car can drive themselves, humans are the cause of the problem, not the computer
i would like to still be able to buy a manual car, fuck what reviewers may say, i know exactly what i want
i'm thinking about ordering one in a couple of weeks. would love to see turbowski's opinions on it aswell.
if the battery is down, nothing more works while my old 74 vw bug can be started by crank or just pushing.
if you dislike the new and modern vehicles and the market you shouldn't be reviewing new vehicles you ass!
it costs 27% more to fix a modern accord from 2016 over the bill of a 2006 accord. and that's a bad thing?
lease for 2 too 3 years and give it back warranty is needed with new cars they are just like phones really
look at hal9000, that lil bitch starting messing up when it was needed most. and we knew that back in '01!
my 94 silverado, never break. except. that truck does nothing but running. long trip can bore me to death.
my dad when i bought a car in 2001 good, you got wind-up windows. less that can go wrong, cheaper to fix .
no wayyy. its time to fcking warrr. so lets do itt everyone with togetha. just for god dammmm fuck sackes.
ridiculous. if you're injured in a wreck with one of these cars, i see lawsuits against the manufacturers.
subscribed because of your stance towards bullshit, instead of fanboying and being a capitalist apologist.
that's why you buy used from my choice of a new 2016 which cost $36k was instead $21k from a 2 year owner.
the mercedes s123 followed by the w123, w126, bmw 635csi and saabs are still way better than any car ever!
this is why i tried to find a car with as little technology as possible. price is still ridiculous though.
too many electronic gimmiks,stupid dsg gear boxes,shitty electronic hand brakes.diesel engines dpf filters
videos that get to the point, sooner rather than later, reach those outside of the choir more effectively.
when these guys discover that you can use the touch screen with the carred stopped they will be mind blown
yes these are wasteful commodities in your car. i want a car that is going to last 20 years like my dad's.
you have a choice, buy luxury or by affordable. dacia logan mcv seats 7 $10.100 with high portuguese taxes
you know a way to solve this is that you don't really own a car but like uber just order one to you right?
3 to 5 year old bmw, mercedes or volvo are are cost prohibitive and a complete waste of the initial capital
agreed,new cars suck.my newest car is a 96 bronco,then an 86 mustang and a 72 jeep.easy repairs i do myself
blind spot monitoring, and backup cameras aren't needed if cars were designed so you could see out of them!
don't be greedy, don't buy shit you cant afford, don't sit on your couch all day, and don't invest in cars.
f this video f these comments none of us worth my time btw my time is probably worth more per hour than you
get to the freaking point already. and get a better job if you want a better car. duh. stupid lazy liberal.
he should study economics and understand the system and not picking out one issue and complaining about it.
i have a 2007 accord with nav. honda wont update the maps unless i pay about 300$. you're completely right.
i have a feeling that today's muscle cars won't age as well as the old classic ones for these reasons alone
i like the electric everything cars so if your battery is dead you cant get into your car when it's raining
i watched this video and said. this is why autonomous driving will never be mainstream on all cars. period.
if you're saying that those things are not necessary in the first place, then why do you even need updates?
interesting perspective. i guess i didn't connect the dots between obsolete gps systems and other car tech.
me. i'm just going to end up like people in cuba. just drive around in a car from the 90s in 30 years time.
over twenty years ago i realized that the more technology you put into a car the more you have to go wrong!
that’s why i get base model. add the little things i want down the road so if they fail i know i can fix it
the biggest problem with modern cars is that it's the 21st century and they still don't drive autonomously.
the funny thing is that even though i have sirius xm on my 2014 cruze i usually don't change channels much.
this is why i drive older well maintained cars. easy to operate, easy to fix. oh and they are cheap to buy.
this video applies only to poor people. rich people don't complain about this, they buy 100 k dollars cars.
total for hc 2006 is not $1364, it is $967. so, hc 2016 is not 27% more expensive, it's 92% more expensive!
very informative and eye opening. this will definitely help me in choosing my next car. no titanium for me!
why doesn't america make a train that goes to each city in each state and have buses for local city travel?
you can buy an toyota aygo just like me if you think you cant afford a 40000$ car. touch screen is a bless!
you probably have a point to some extent, but you're a very negative and impoverished person or a tightwad?
you r just a poor idiot. complaining all of these just because your pocket is empty. shut up and work hard.
your problem is planned obsolescence. not consumerism or capitalism. they've outlawed it in some countries.
1987 cutlass, 30 min. to 1 hour to replace. 2005 trailblazer, 7 hours minimum. it just gets worse and worse.
a surprisingly amount of most used rolls royce owner haha they just keep on driving the car with broken tech
by a diesel car people, they're environmentally friendly, cheap to run and low road fund. a few years later!
ffs. i would be inclined to say let them crash, were it not for the collateral damage that scenario implies.
great, lets go back to the ´50 with no airbags, abs or even seatbelts just to keep cost low. bullshit video.
hey you can buy ford a or renault type d série b or mercedes 35 ps then you haven’t problem with modern cars
how about paying $500 to $2500 dollars to get a new key fob coded when you happen to lose your keys. oi vey!
i also hate all the stare i get when i'm driving in a shiny new lambo. hell man, i fucking rent it. so what?
i can see some car company breaking the standarts and making a popular car with small number of electronics.
i don't buy into their marketing stuff, there's no liberty in owning a car, only financial responsibilities.
in the same day i rode in a model a thru a parade and a lincoln mk something, and i will take the mk any day
modern cars are about everything expect driving or driving pleasure that why i love the car i drive normally
newer cars save more lives. but put yo ass in debt. so you're alive longer to pay companies. fuck capitalism
quite an eye-opening video. i doubt cars that are new today will last 20 years like my current 1998 one did.
take out all the good, unnecessary technology shit, and you got yourself a $7500 piece of driving simplicity
that's why i drive an '07 mitsubishi, there's no fancy stuff that can break or needs constant os updates lol
these new cars don't last. all that means is don't be intending to keep them long term. ditch under 1000000.
this is hilarious. its like people here have never heard of used cars before. whatever. more for me i guess.
try dacia dokker, sandero, logan - very good and non-expensive cars. better than german ones am from germany
we buy used cars instead. cars that we actually can afford. do you have to have the newest and shiniest car?
you are absolutely right. modern cars have become disposable object. disposable and more and more expensive!
you think modern vehicles are horrid now, just wait until 2035. you'll be begging for a 2012+ model vehicle.
also why do modern car ac suck so hard?. why can't it just blow air from outside or the motor or mix those 2!
can wait to have an on demand driverless card subscription. i mean i love driving but the cost is ridiculous.
for example, a car from 2002 would be worth $15,000 while the same branded car would be worth $25,000 in 2017
for the tech to keep you safe, there is this one free thing called learn to fucking drive.saves a lot of cash
i'll probably never own a 21st century car. 20th century has already provided me with an fc rx-7 and soon fb.
if you are broke, poor. you tend to get mad at technology and nice things because you cant afford them. sucks
it's to bad we can't go back to the old cars with very less technology like the old e36 from 1997 for exemple
let's face it would you buy a car from the 50's without a c, power steering, auto trans., alarm, stereo, etc.
mark my words, there will be a resurgence in retro modern, more simplistic in tech and vastly cheaper to run.
most people can't afford cars. their mommy and daddy buy it for them, or they lease it, or go into huge debt.
nailed it. and that's why the only cars on the planet in my eyes is the ariel atom 3s and jeep rubicon. done.
never. never buy a brand new car, that car you got for say 32,500 today in 5 years will be worth 16,500. wtf!
oh, and it also has a remote control, not a slow touch screen to get messed up with fingerprints and smudges!
omg this video is such millennial garbage. such an entitled sack of shit. buy a car you can afford you idiot.
only can afford to buy 50 dollars worth of groceries and it shows buying a cart full of hostess snacks lmfao!
poor little snow flake cant afford a car. not everyone is equal. get over it. dumbest video ever. click bait.
quick solution build your own car without all those 'problems' and we'll see how long you keep your ass in it
the value of cars. people are deciding it's not worth buying a car at the price it costs to manufacture them.
watching him change the temperature for the a c unit gave me a freaking headache. agree with everything said.
you forgot one more thing, they are so easy to crash and cost alot to repair comparing to 90s and below cars.
40k car is a luxury segment, of course most people won't be able to afford a luxury car when they are 20, duh.
i am laughing about people buying modern cars. 80s and early 90s is the way to go. plus fck eco friendly cars!
i especially agree with the touchscreen issues, first, how hard is it to make hard glass touchscreens in cars?
i really wanted to sell my '69 el camino a while back. then i came to my senses. i'm glad i'm not the only one
if u barely mange to buy a car and if you are stupid enough to buy a bmw mercedes audi then you are ass fucked
in poland we ern 4 time less many and cars cost 2 times more then in usa. min price of mustang is 165 000 pln.
made me think twice on getting a brand new family car. might as well look for a 2nd hand in tip top condition?
new cars. its always been like this retard. technology advances. in ten years a 2016 will be piss cheep to fix
okay, so point two was they're modern now, which sucks. they won't be modern in 5 years, which sucks, come on.
the proof is in the pudding of the complex modern cars. remember when recalls were for airbags and seat belts?
why i’m not getting rid of my 07 fj cruiser and why i’m buying a 19 4runner. old school and not a lot of tech.
you can buy aftermarket car mechanical insurance. buy a second hand vehicle outright and get mechanical cover.
you should live in europe and you'd stop bitching about the costs of a car plus maintenance in the usa at all.
almost any modern car will last a quarter million miles with regular car. how many older cars lasted that long?
buy mid range model e.g. lx in honda civic with minimal useless tech. but important features like abs, ebd etc.
cool video savage, so is there still a vehicle made currently out there is not exposed as much to these issues?
electronic handbrakes. what is that about they just suck big time. they hamper hill starts and often just fail.
here in europe there is the dacia brand based on older models. they are quite simple and have good reliability.
i bought a 89 honda crx hatchback 600$ for work and its the ugliest car on the road. but the engine runs great!
i must say, after watching this video, it has me rethinking my entire strategy, regarding my next car purchase.
i really don't like that some cars don't have a knob to adjust volume. instead it's on the stupid touch screen.
i see two main problems with today's automotive industry 1. overengineered for the comfort they claim to offer.
i've just subbed you buddy. that's the most intrinsically detailed argument i've ever had the pleasure. horror?
if you're on a limited grocery budget, a 100% diet of twinkies and hostess cupcakes might not be your best bet.
in the uk, sam model $30000. fuel in the uk about 4 times as much. you want to see high prices, come to europe.
just had to fix keyless entry lock. apparently the car wasn't locked for weeks or months until i discovered it.
lucky me, don't even have a radio in my car no distractions also no sound dampening can't hear a radio anyway .
seriously one of the most accurate, dead on, best freaking videos i've ever seen. could have been an hour long.
so the disparitiy is even bigger, more like 50% from new to old. which makes his whole point even more obvious.
solution be smarter than the market. i bought a house, a new car, and a family suv all before i turned 25. how?
somebody sneezes at you on a parking lot and bam, new lights for 1000€. heated frontal window with rain sensor?
this is why you get a used civic 2008-2012 they are reliable and cheaper to repair than any other reliable car.
you can text and drive as well, doesn't mean it's a good idea. you make some solid points, but that was stupid.
you don't have to get these things in the newer cars just go for the lx models with the most basic of features.
50 thousand dollars is not even close to enough to my college tuition for one year. and now i have 6 years to go
a smartphone somebody keeps it for 2 to 3 years and if he is not a tech savvy person he may keep it max 5 years!
agreed. they are going to have to steal my car to get it away from me. i plan on driving it until it falls apart
are people in debt hell where they are near destitute and surviving on porridge just so they can have a new car?
do you really need a 4000 pound chunk of metal that cost you your life's savings to get from point a to point b?
for me the biggest problem with modern cars is how ugly they are cars looked way better in the 50s and early 60s
i agree with you one hundred percent. i wish they would just get back to the basic. minimize all the electronics
i have a 1997 ford thunderbird and i had my first engine repair this year. an intake manifold gasket had failed.
i'm glad i brought a new car without a touch screen wish i could've got a manual transmission while i was at it.
lol since my dad already bought 4 cars from that dealer they handle every maintenance thing free of cost. please
same can be said about the smart phones. especially the korean equivalent to kia which is samsung's junk phones.
so like a hypocrite he tells you not to drive a modern car and then he drives them on in car that makes no sense
that is why i love my cherokee 2004 and merc 220e coupe, lovely rides and all this technology may kiss my arse.!
the biggest mistakes they made in cars are, front wheel drive, computers, fuel injection, and keyless ignitions!
the stupidest new technology i can think about is the key-less start ignition button, jeez just use the damn key
there are solutions for replacing factory touch screen heating controls, etc. idatalink is one company doing it.
this is stupid. buy something on craigslist used. a lot cheaper even if you have to repair it from time to time.
this is why i really do not want a car with all that technology. how long do they think people be in there cars?
today we think problems with a 7 year old car are something surprising but in 1985 the story was very different!
a touchscreen should be cheaper than a whole panel of buttons. fuck these companies. they are ripping people off.
absolutely wright about touch screen for basic simple function. a complete unnecessary distraction of the driver.
all the dangerous things they put in cars that create dangerous situations must be handled by a competent lawyer.
and who deliberately remain blissfully ignorant of just how much better new cars are than older cars. jomk1wzjp7g
doesn't anyone make simple, no-nonsense easy to use and easy to maintain cars that don't need to look like tanks?
drop the screens, bring in voice commands, and give us better designed fundamentally safe cars. it's easily done.
honestly it's why i've only gotten used cars just spend some time learning to fix a cheap older car it's worth it
i couldn't even lean forward or backward enough to really completely see my blind spot either. and the a columns?
i don't understand the one of the reasons why modern cars are bad cost. of course they are going to be expensive!
i for one say the hell with new cars. apple car play, electronic e brake, hybridcrossover watchamacallit. really?
it's just the insurance companies trying to not pay out. that's what the laws are based on. seatbelt. smoking etc
my prius actually disables most touch screen features until the car has come to a complete stop. its pretty smart
ok electric users are of the hook but half the cars lifetime co2 output is through its making in the first place.
plastic headlights really great how they yellow and craze and fog up after a few years so much better than glass.
stop buying more car than you can really afford financing is foolish. save and buy a car once you can afford one.
tesla's cars literally addresses and solves all of the issues raised in this video. modern cars are looking good.
the first part is like complaining that rolex watches are expensive. if you can't afford it, you can't afford it.
this only serves to prove why the pre-2000 vehicles were better. easier to repair and less built in distractions.
when i'm driving, i don't want to be fiddling with screens and buttons and dials. i want to be enjoying the road.
you re so right i have a 20 year old camaro that runs much better than my new car the new one is only a year old.
you’re a dumb ass. you’re 100% the problem with modern society. be responsible for yourself and your own actions.
your right every one runs me down cause i own my cars and can fix them 65 tbird and 4 others newest 92 enjoy them
2009 impala no touchscreens, no apps, no sensors, no keyless ignition, no traction control, no bullshit. i love it
i drive a 2004 holden monaro gto, basically an engine on wheels, no fancy shit at all. wouldn't want anything else
i find the main problem with high end very powerful very expensive beautiful sports cars. is that i don’t own one.
im just gonna keep rebuilding and restoring my 1967 mustang. people in 2067 will be like wow that car still works?
it’s totally voluntary. the average age of vein the road now is close to 10 yrs old, and that’s for a good reason.
just want a infotainment with bluetooth and mic so i dont have to have wires everywhere as well answer phone calls
love my base subaru wrx. old school perfectly tuned knobs and no touch screren bullshit which looks sissy in cars.
one problem is the government regulations over engine emissions. the rules are changing too much and too regularly
our car is 11 years old. and manufacturers like the vw group vw, audi. have updates for their inrotainment systems
quite true. but people keep buying it them. what if we all asked for cars without touch screens and all that crap?
so don't spend $40k. there are plenty of great new midsize sedans and cuvs in the low 20s. is that still too much?
thank you for also going over the insane hvac controls these auto companies are coming up with. i mean seriously??
that is why i have a 1967 corvette, 1970 chevy 4x4 blazer, 1964 lincoln continental, 1971 chevy 4x4 pu truck 1 ton
that is why i prefer to use my phone for navigation and music etc. and have actual buttons and knobs for the rest.
the state of the world in all times we had capitalism was always bad. profit is always at the expense of somebody.
you can not get a stripped down basic vehicle in the u.s. with manual everything windows, heater, door locks, etc!
2008 subaru impreza without any of this stuff, so i understand the problem, but i don't have to deal with it 👌 lol
buy the base model probaly pay half of 42k, but then you will complain lack of those that you're complaining about.
correction biggest problem with modern cars too many fucking computers like he said it costs a fortune to fix them!
don’t blame capitalism. capitalism is just a tool. while you may se it as the problem, it can also be the solution.
duh that stuff is cheap af, they're just ripping us off. one of those lcd screens cost the manufacturer maximum 5$.
get a car from the 1980ies, one of the german brands. heavy duty, longlife engineering. no gadgets. problem solved.
i've been saying for years how i don't want a big touch screen in my car and they all think i'm crazy, great video!
i’m going electric ⚡️ and pub trans uber. terrible value. fuck these money pits. i’ll be lucky to get 5k for it now
if you can't afford a certain vehicle then save up for it or buy what you can afford. it's just that simple people!
if you don’t want useless gimmicky tech the o my way out is buying shitty vehicles and that makes me so fucking mad
is there a company out there that sells new models without a display and just straight up minimal tech electronics?
it's part of bringing money to the car industry. it helps the economy and gives people jobs, so just let it happen.
kidding me zero sense why they do it bec of money that's why and utter pos humans who need to eradicated themselves
modern cars in 15 words beep. beep. beep. beep. beep. beep. driver aids. ding-dong. sensors. keys that aren't keys.
my old 2000 truck with a v10 just keeps on going. have the money but don't want to buy into the new turbo problems.
stupid automatic transmission gear selectors are now the stupidity of modern cars. buttons, switches, rotary dials.
the biggest problem is they are all junk,made cheaply,and not really cars,they are crap,gm biggest crap,huge turds.
the day my '97 corolla dx dies however long that may be i'll just buy another car from the late 90s to early 2000s.
they go through sensors faster than my oldsmobile leaks transmission fluid not that fast but the point still stands
video is 100% true. i would love to get a modern 4x4 with manual everything & just the basics w out any extra junk.
well, first off, if you are in your 20s, ofc you cant afford a new lexus. who in the sane mind want a 40 000 lexus?
you do not need constant updates. older cars don't need constant updates. why do modern cars need constant updates?
you're not supposed to have a great financial life in your 20s. don't go to college to spend 200 k just to make 40k
a car should have 3 switches for a c, how fast do you want it, how hot cold do you want it, and where do you want it
american cars have to many. chimes. the doors open. bing. bing. bing. i know it’s open because i can step out of it.
do you kow any average car-repair-shop that has a technician knowing how to repair anything in this bug-growboxes? !
hey genius. cars today are not more expensive than cars of old. there is this thing called i-n-f-l-a-t-i-o-n, hello?
i bought a phase 3 miata, it's about the driving experience so it doesn't have all that cheap electric tinsel on it.
i was expecting a waaaaaay different tone from this video. the beginning feels like a truther video or a vice video.
i've been saying it for 15 years the biggest problem with having a touch screen is you have to look at it to use it!
it´s really invigorating for hope, to hear these valiant americans, talking straight against consumism & capitalism.
its a growing movement drive a low tech car not a carburetor but a simple mono jettronic fuel injection less is more
no. 3 automatic transmission. oh, hold on. no. 4 those frikken bicycle wheels they give you for when you get a flat.
omg. dear auto manufacturers, enough with touch screens. give me a freaking tactile sweet clicking button or switch!
problem 1 solved by tesla ev less parts 2 solved by tesla mcu, autopilot, hardware upgradeable, ota software updates
there are only 2 things a cars computer should do keep the air fuel mixture stoyciometric, and keep asb functioning.
these are all the same complaints that were made when abs was introduced, tubeless tires, electric windows. come on.
this is a very whiny video. cars are available without modern tech features. if you don't like them, don't buy them.
this video makes me love my 2002 peugeot 106, it cost £800 and the only technology is the radio and electric windows
too much electronics outside of the engine, transmission system and breaking system. the rest is just toy component.
you know, you can buy reliable used cars and low spec new cars for under 20,000. you don't have to buy a 43,000 car.
you should consider buying the manufacturer's extended warranty with low deductible option and stop complaining. lol
you've confirmed what i've suspected for a while now. looks like used cars from the aughts and 90's for me for life.
100,000s of wastefully scrapped vw diesels that were reliable and pretty efficient. replaced by energy guzzling suvs!
all cars i own are at least 20 years old. for exactly the reasons given in your vid. thumbs up for the good analysis!
be methodical. take your time. research the vehicle. look at your financial situation honestly and not egotistically.
can someone help me figure this out, i don't get it, also are you wrecking your cars side view mirror off the hinges?
do automakers also not understand if it's cold and you're wearing gloves you can't turn up the heat on a touchscreen?
good points but you re too slow. the 2nd point you went out of common sense- you can use touch screans when you stop!
had to be replaced due to a stuck cd. $2000 from dealer. $1200 for aftermarket. $500 for a used and tested oem piece.
i am so sad that you made this video. this is terrible and not necessary. please stick to just making awesome reviews
i can't stand when cars have every single physical control built into a touch screen system. wanna change the volume?
i have a very simple solution to this video buy an older car and stfu. fix it yourself and everything becomes cheaper
i just hate having touch controls in a car. i'm glad my bmw was made in 1995 and doesn't have any bullshit like that.
im from central europe and point 1 i agree 100%. i just dont get it where do people get so much money for those cars?
it was so much more intuitive when things were physical controls, not these poor user interface infotainment systems.
just compare each item to the other and tell me the difference. nearly everything on the right is twice as expensive!
lifetime transmission oil is another one. a con. they know once it it's about 180k miles oil just gets worse & worse.
love my honda prelude. 1400$ for a 40,000 jdm h22 motor from hmotors, leak and compression tested start up guarantee.
older cars are better, less to go wrong and easier to fix. also they lasted longer, no planned obsolescence bullshit.
solutions is simple, just buy yugo. yeah,its old, bad quality but no technology at all, and its cheap to to repar,lol
technology makes human stupid. i really am not against it but people should get a license to prove they are eligible.
that is why, if you want a modern car. just buy the base trim or an entry-level trim and specify options accordingly.
this fool is complaining about all kinds of shit and drives a hyundai and honda smh lol the fuck did you expect girl?
welcome to 2019 all technologies have the same problem. phones stoves tvs etc. get used to it it's going to get worse
why didnt you just bough an air freshener. the difference is that i drive my personality and they drive an appliance.
you made that choice. do not cry when your bill gets up because you did not give two fucks about extending your plan!
bang on. the newest car i have is from 2008 and i am afraid to go newer. i may drive classics for the rest of my life.
cars are a lot more reliable today than they were a few years back. remember valve grinds and de-cokes for the engine?
do it you think it’s time rethink the leasing of automobiles. let them pay for repairs on these cars, really computers
geese poo sucks and is wierd green white. they are the jerks of the poo world. i baught a 400 dollar car at 16 in 2002
i will say owning a new bmw your only cost is car payments and insurance for the first 4 years. it is kind of awesome.
i'm fine with the infotainment and apps like yelp but for the love of god make in inaccessable while the car is moving
it's manufacturers fault people in our culture don't pay attention to the road and purchase beyond their income level.
no one needs to buy a car for 42,000 dollars. theres nothing wrong with modern cars and modern tech. you dont like it?
bought a 2001 lincoln town car as my first car for $2500 with 100k miles on it. hasn't failed me since. love that boat.
by the title was expecting to reffer to some technical issue, when you said cost, was like got to subscribe to this guy
for your safety, and convenience, we managed for how long with out it. 1977 scout ii ,1979 bronco best 5k i ever spent.
getting older cars like an 2003 honda civic has less tech and pretty affordable, and the repairs cost less than modern.
i don't know why there are nearly 2,000 thumbs down on this video. he has a lot of very valid points that are all true.
i have 1 hyundai from year 2000. in the past days i drive a peugeot 508 sw from 2015 for 3 weeks and i love technology!
i love it and i am not looking forward to getting a new car, but even it being 12 years old is a little too new for me.
i've been in the it business for 22 years but, i just don't like all the stuff their doing to cars nowadays. bluetooh??
if everyone bought older cars people would keep more money plus they have to do a little work after a while by yourself
it's not designed to. this video is just so misguided. maybe the problem is you not understanding what a modern car is.
lol your a fucking idiot when it comes to shopping no wonder you were going broke man you can get one for 75 bucks oem.
modern technology is primitive, unnecessary and life threatening most of the time. and yet, we are so proud of it. why?
people don't buy cheap stripped down cars. want a compact with a manual transmission, crank windows. no body wants one.
push 4 buttons to access the correct menu and then you can. why can't it just be dials and switches like it used to be?
the biggest problem, of course, is the wipers coming on as soon as you use the sprinklers. impossible to soak the bugs.
the moment you sign that paper, the car already depreciated. it's not worthit. use your legs and public transportation.
these modern cars are so bad, they are lemon from the get go. the only place modern cars deserve to be is the junkyard!
this is a good video which comes to show i'm not alone on modern car issues. it's well composed. thanks for the upload!
this started when apple removed the clickwheel from their ipods. clickwheel was so much superior to a tiny touchscreen.
those big screen tablets for the car are a real piece of shit. would not buy a car with that. except if i can change it
we have had our truck for 8 years and it's 100% fine. our cadillac is 2 years old and it's still pretty much brand new.
with this realization. automakers could build 'reliable' cars with less technology, then market them for better safety.
yeah and think about the cost of self driving cars. do they upgrade the software. all that computer controlled linkage.
you really opened up a can o' worms. oh well, so much for the those corporate sponsors i hinted at a few vids ago. lol!
you’re absurdly wrong about vehicle manufacturers having evil intentions because of capitalism. pure conspiracy theory.
4 mins in and all this guy is doing is bitching that he doesnt make enough money. get a better job and stop complaining.
all a bit conspiratorial. car company's loading cars with dangerous distractions in order to put more safety systems in?
also, if you have debt like student loans and credit cards, get those things paid up, retire you credit card debt first!
amen, buddy. imagine if we had a choice between autos with all the bells and whistles, and autos without. crank windows?
buy a volvo 240 estate for peanuts, have it fixed by your local mechanic, do the usual routine yourself. simple as that.
don't forget the plastic accent panels that get dislodged easily. body shops will charge hundreds just to make it right.
how about that modern cars are so damn ugly compared to classics. they get more turd shaped and drab looking every year.
i hate modern cars. i cannot work on them. a car from the 60s excites me with carbs and analogue instruments excites me!
i just found your channel but i really really liked this video and your personality i am probably subscribing keep it up
i wonder what this guy would think of coming to europe consider the gas prices in us is something we could just dream of
just buy an old car. my car is running great after 16 years and 220,000 miles. it's because they are simply made better.
new car talk to the company and they pass on where and when you drive. how fast you were going. etc. new cars spy on you
people absolutely dump on deloreans, yet my 1983 still runs great and is way, wayyyyyy cheaper to maintain than my audi.
people must not complain when they buy smart cars loaded with electronics that cost a fortune to fix or car devaluation.
rarely do you see a young lady get into their car after shopping without first turning on their dumbing down cell phones
so true my friend so true the new cars are so awesome yet so crappy at the same time. it's like your driving an oxymoron
technology for technologies sake. electric handbrakes, lane departure systems, touch screen climate control. all bollox.
the companies are catering to the morons that want an entertainment system, not just a vehicle to get from point a-to-b.
the youth today do not care about wasting money. i am willing to buy old cars with obsolete electronics for a $100 cash.
think seriously about this how in the heck are you suppose to plow through a crowd of zombies if your car won't let you?
why would anyone prefer distracting obnoxious fiddling with the screen to change the temperature over nice simple knobs?
boooooo!. 2 weeks ago i was in a bad wreck and all i know is if i was in an old car i would been injured or dead so yeah.
create tech to prevent people from hurting themselves whilst being occupied with new tech. way to create your own market.
cuz you can’t afford to replace your car every few years like a smart phone. at least tesla is offering software updates.
get a good warranty and get a used affordable electric car less moving parts, less parts to break, boom, problems solved.
holy shit. a modest education and career can easily fetch a new $40k car. is everyone out there only making minimum wage?
i challenge you to 40 mph head on crash. i bet i walk away. and you leave in a stretcher. you can have your plastic cars.
if not then do not buy it. that is just plain bad car buying. the vehicles in this had steering wheel controls. use them.
move to new york city, your problem is solved, or move to china. why don't you complain how they designed city so spread?
regarding the tech i per don't want it because it is such a distraction, but i never even thought about software updates.
the problem is everyone is cheap. everyone wants to drive a new fancy car, but want it fixed for free when it breaks. foh
the true problem with modern cars those hideous big mouth billy bass-ish grills. i genuinely hate the look of modern cars
touch controls are horrible. i just got used 2008 hyondai i30 with automatic transmission and i am glad it's so barebones
we dont want the proletaruat riding around in cars. ther roads are crowded enough already. gotta do something about that.
ya buddy, fun fact, ur not supposed to use the screen to search for ur restaurant while moving, stop somewhere and search
you buy a 7 year old car for about 25% of the original sticker price, drive it into the ground then dump it. in the trash
you can't compare the price of parts for new cars and ten year old cars the parts are always more when they are brand new
you don't need computers. just and engine that works, paired dependably to a transmission, with good steering and brakes.
as for updates, its called after market mods if you mod your car a lot of tech is by passed for better performance anyhow!
at the end of the day all i need is a car to get me from point a to point b safely, all the tech is a joke and a money pit
big daddy gubbament over regulation. only safety feature should be an anunciator telling drivers to get off the damn phone
bought a 95 supercharged riviera last week. i guarantee my car will last another 20 years. these newer cars won't last 10.
buy a used car if you don't like the enormous prices. and get a older car if you don't like the added technological specs.
everybody wants to have the top of the top technology and piece of engineering, but no one wants to pay the buck. wtf man?
i absolutely hate volvo for making the climate control options integrated into the touch screen. it is hideous and unsafe.
i drive 2003,volvo s60 d5, nearing 3,00,000 kms ,it absolutely works fine, i am thinking where to upgrade to new volvo v60
i have​ speed limiter that i will never use. driver assist, i will never use, cruise control, i will never use. eco drive?
man i’m never getting a car that was made this century, not only is there the tech but i’m obsessed with 90s japanese cars
most newer cars fail to interest me. i've been driving the same w123 300d since 2005 and i plan to keep it a while longer.
my 09 civic had the right amount of tech, abs and traction control. i could have done without the traction control really.
my advice don’t ever buy a mercedes-benz. if it breaks you will crap a brick trying to fix it. my single worse investment.
no one needs a car, no one needs an iphone and no one needs a 60 big screen tv. that is what public transportation is for.
so yeah what can be done if your ac heating is tied into them touch screens & it goes bad which it's gonna eventually do??
thats why i drive a 94 merc c class lol. i bought it like for 1500$ and i never fixed anything in 1.5 years only fueled xd
the automotive simplicity i seek no longer exists. i wonder what the new dancing digital gauge clusters are going to cost.
the issue is that today's young people are under the impression that they deserve a new car or 15 thousand dollar vehicle!
then just buy vehicles that are less expensive that don't have all the bells and whistles. they still sell those you know.
this is why i love my 1997 honda accord. it was so trouble free and simple. one of the best cars ever made, in my opinion.
this is why i'm happy with my 1995 f-150. i got a mustang v-8, a radio, and a heater. and in reality, that's all you need.
unless your car makes money for you its a liability and will keep you in debt. more bells and whistles more to break down.
would people be open to aftermarket head units or solutions to modern in car electronics that can be updated and upgraded?
wow what a refreshingly calm and intelligent delivery from across the pond, you resisted the yo whats happenin opener too!
and i don't miss any of the luxuries of newer cars because i'm forced to put down my phone, turn down the music, and drive!
even tho the technology is in there to prevent accidents insurance companies will charge you a premium for owning a new car
get an older car with double din and install a $250 android head unit. not only is it cheaper, you can update it over wifi!
i buy my cars 2-3 years old. it saves a ton of money and if you get from the original dealership they’ll give ya a warranty
i get updates on my 2012 focus. i can take it in they do it or i can download it to thumb drive or sd card and it installs.
i hate how car makers are oblivious to proper ui standards. slapping a touch screen on your fridge does not make it better!
i only use a phone for calling texting, and youtube. i don't see how anyone can do productive work without a laptop desktop
i will never own anything other than 200-900 series volvo’s years 1988-1995 with redblock motor. best cars i’ve ever owned.
i'd like to add the no1 biggest problem. it's poor quality. nowadays, vehicles are made for nice look only but shit inside.
if i wanted a fucking touchscreen in my car i can jist glue an android tablet onto my dashboard and put android auto on it.
im 100% with you on the infotainment part. my range rover evoque has a touch screen for me to use for 90% of the functions.
imagine a car that gets a wifi update. updating your ecu, tcm, pcm. so it's like. pls wait 65 100 then tcm for dct updated!
join the military. free housing, free college, free food, and enough to afford a 800 car payment and insurance for the car.
just buy a cheaper car. you can get a modern suv brand new for half of what you said living proof thats family friendly etc
just for good measure, a brand new civc sedan in brazil costs around 26 grand, the shitty model. fusion, it costs 30 grand!
modern cars are boring no character. built to function efficiently and economically they all look the same. oh for an ss100
modern cars are just fine, cost of owning is not astronomical. stick to brands like toyota or honda for low cost of owning.
never bought a new car and never will, my daily driver cost me 800 bucks and gets nearly 50 mpg and i could not be happier.
problem number 3 fucking emission bullshit that kill the engines long before their intended lifetime. especially on diesels
so buy a used car. that's what i did when i was young. then learn to do maintenance on your car so you can take care of it.
so it is not just a conspiracy of planned obsolescence it is deeply rooted problem of the business of making durable goods.
such great videos. excellent points here especially. i want to keep you producing videos. if you take donations i'll put up
thats why i have 2 cars for 50 euro a month +insurance w124 300e 1986 and my all day car nissan micra 1989 self maintenance
the sole benefit to all this censor shit added into cars, is when u plug in a diagnostic tool uk exactly where the issue is
there's second hand car a plenty out there, or had that not occurred to you as it does the rest of the car buying universe?
this whole capitalism-focused, anti-consumerism attitude was all created by your country so you only have yourself to blame
what if technology keeps improving and everything gets more convoluted and complicated, but people keep earning 8$ an hour?
you're assuming you have to fix all the tech though. if it quits working you still have a perfectly fine driving a vehicle.
about cost. u need a luck when u get a gift from ur boss. its happened when my dad surprised from ceo and give the honda hrv
and this is why i never buy cars new. and why i am going to buy cars pre 2012 while i can. it's called planned obsolescence.
btw, the $4000 2014 envoy xl i bought was a $40,000 new. i am sure i can keep it running well spending a lot less than that.
can i add that 3. the colored bumper cover that costs more than a black bumper and it breaks more easily and 4. goddamn suv?
cars that stays closer to mechanical state will have better longevity. too much technology in the car problem e.g. chrysler.
however if you can afford it go for it knowing costs will be high. in the other hand if you cant afford go for economy cars.
i hate those dumb integrated touchscreens. give me knobs and something that is easy to replace without losing all functions.
its got to the stage where 2 people are now required to operate a new car with all the crap thats now fitted to modern cars.
makes me have to rock back and forth like a psychopath when stopped at an intersection to make sure nothing is coming at me.
most of the country is organized around cars. your job and home options become much more restricted if you don't have a car.
my current car is a 35yr old nissan patrol from a junkyard its been on the road for 7 years straight and still going strong.
ok. i'mma ask you a ques. would you rather drive a brand spanking new mercedes s63 or a 1989 lexus ls if money is no factor?
one small rock smashes that and bam, another 1000€ bill. these costs do add up. atleast i can buy cheap dacia for 10k euros.
why anyone would go into debt of over $20k for something that is worth half as much in two years is beyond my comprehension.
you can't legislate against stupidity. the same people who drive while using yelp will still find a way to have an accident.
1994 ford bronco 245k miles on original 5.8l. burns no oil. let’s see your cheaply made “reliable” import or new car do that.
a friend did not know how to just turn on auxiliary functions in his push button start car to listen to the radio. hilarious.
a lot of people view cars as a status symbol, & will drown themselves in long-term debt to drive that $30-50k+ suv truck car.
and you have to pay 1k+ every year to the shit government to have the license and the roads are among the worst in the world!
another thing is the damned computerized system that they install that is supposed to fit the darn things to comply with epa!
biggest problems with modern 'cars' are that they are not cars anymore. you are driving in a damn computer with an ic engine.
completely agree and it's criminal imo. phones are such a huge distraction and building one into the dash is exactly the same
don't blame that on manufacturers, blame that on consumers. consumers are the problem not the cars and not the manufacturers.
ford motor company is now going to end their production of passenger cars due to lack of sales because of cost for one thing.
i agree, i hate all this fucken electronics in my cars all over. i dont want wifi and keyless ignition or anything like that.
i drive 21 year old opel vectra and my last repair was 5years ago coast me 75 dolars to replace fuel pump. its cheap and last
i understand engine and transmission problems, but if a blind spot sensor broke, i wouldn't consider that a necessity to fix.
i want a caurburetor, metal bumpers, a mechanical distributor, a mechanical fuel pump, rear-wheel-drive, and classic styling!
i would rather drive a paid for car than have payments. if you have to borrow money to buy something then you cant afford it.
if they want me to buy a new car they will need to provide an option without the tech, imo the touchscreen should be illegal.
is it for real that you americans are complaining because you must pay your 40.000 usd car in 60 payments of 800 like really?
one thing they should mention is the stooooopid cost of new vehicle diagnostic equipment. 5000$ a year just to get an update.
please do a video on the simplest new non technology drivers cars out there on the market, and what u would recommend, thanks
replaceable head units were the best. but tesla and their swap-able ap pc is awesome, plus the frequent and free ota updates.
thanks you for the information it make since so i will keep my 2013 toyota 4runner and i will not been looking for a new one!
they are built so that you can not perform the simplest maintenance yourself. u cant even change a lightbulb on most of them.
too much tech, too damn ugly, too damn heavy and big, front-wheel drive everywhere, too many driver aids, too much tech, etc.
what i can’t stand is the fact that i can’t upgrade my radio because everything is integrated into to infotainment screen smh
where is it written that a young person recent college graduate, i'm assuming should be able to afford a new $42,000 vehicle?
you spent half a video talking about costs. man, you're lucky you don't live in brazil. we have shitty cars, which much more!
2017 toyota 86 standard double din head unit 2 buttons and a d-pad on the steering wheel no extra funky shit i love it so much
as a millennial, i run away from modern cars. don't have time to deal with them. rather spent my time driving a good ol manual
back then they used to make cars to last forever. now today modern day cars are build just to last until the warranty expires.
i think i'll keep my entry level 1999 camry a few more years. it's basic, cheap, very dependable, and even a bit fun to drive.
i'm tired of hearing people blaming capitalism for their problems, not realizing how bad life was where capitalism was absent.
i've seen so many failures it automotive technology, being a auto technician. that is one reason why i don't buy new vehicles!
if they just removed all the bullshit in them just left the gas pedal breaks and a radio we wouldn't have problems buying cars
im not gonna buy any of those ugly modern cars. oldtimers are gold age of cars and ill be rather buy oldtimer than modern car.
it has newer been cheaper to buy, own and drive a car. modern cars are amazingly reliable, economical and safe. that's a fact.
lexus and bmw to the best of my knowledge are the only japanese and euro luxury car companies that still use physical bottons.
look at the windows in modern cars. designed soooo small that you need inside a camera for looking around. what a crazy world.
merry christmas from bangor, maine where marijuana is legal and home prices are still some of the lowest in the entire nation.
modern cars are so extra so boring so ugly so big they are just not listening to their customers. and yes cost is way too high
my parents have two 40,000 cars. they live below their means as well. i dont know how they do it, it’s quite amazing honestly.
newer cars simply do not let you use aftermarket parts with aftermarket will cause dash errors will not work same as oem part!
number 1, don't buy something you can't afford. two, used cars are cheeper, and three, don't have any kids with a gold digger.
people always want their shiny new toys. buying shit they dont need for money they dont have to impress people they dont know.
so much truth in this video, and is why i'm happy to buy the base spec model because it doesn't have all the long term expense
the only technology i've used in a car is turning the hot seats on in the passenger seat during the summer to piss people off.
there are a lot of cheap new cars below $10,000. don't really understand why one would complain. can't afford a brand new car?
they make things overly expensive to replace parts so you end up trading it in to buy a new one to keep the debt circle going!
touch screen or touch anything in cars are the worst thing. there should be a law that requires buttons for certain functions.
you have to add some technology to the car to mask the fact that it is still running with a fossil fueled 100 year old engine.
you seem to be logical, so be logical all the way. how do you expect manufacturers to keep updating every vehicle for 5 years?
buy a mercedes 190 diesel.0 to 60 in two days, but it can do 1 milion miles without major repairs. no modern car can beat that.
don't buy a car with a touch screen. i do agree with costs though, safety regulations add about 25% to the cost of a car alone.
get a new tablet. a common android tablet is a lot faster than the cars computer. there is no reason this cannot be done today.
i don't have this problem, i still have my old and trusty 2004 hyundai getz. small car, hadn't had a lot of use and goes great.
i'm sick of driving because the cost of maintaining a car. ten year old camry, 55,000 miles and i got 4500 in repairs. amazing.
i'm so happy someone said this. sadly people that need this advice so they don't spend all there money are not going to listen.
it's cheaper to make a car with only an lcd speedometer, and provide a clip or a magnet based solution for a tablet smartphone!
just put a stereo in the car with bluetooth. rest i can do with smart phone. music streams, waze for gps etc. only need 2 knobs
manufactures come out with software and part updates all the time for these modern vehicles. often covered by the manufacturer.
moan all you want, but i'm more than happy with my '16 lacrosse. if you don't like technology in cars then simply don't buy it.
my favorite part of this video was that you really censored a lot of what you really wanted to say and just kept it to 2 topics
my pet peeve is the touch screens which force you to take your eyes from the road to adjust the heat or change a radio station.
no. i haft to plug in the computer to pull the dtcs from the ecu to see the fault codes before i even touch the car. worthless!
oh cmon, full insurance is not that pricey. you can buy new car every 7 years, so it doesnt get that old and wont need repairs.
people can afford it cause they were smart enough to goto university for a career that makes money unlike all these art degrees
that's why i drive a 4 door 1950 ford. if something breaks 9 10 i can fix it on the roadside with one set of standard wrenches.
they wouldn't put all this useless tech into cars if the consumers didn't demand it. i'll stick with 03 vw, its nice and basic.
this man thinks like i do. notice tech in every area starts high and drops in price like phones, tv's etc. but vehicles do not!
well, sure. in singapore or malaysia, the cheapest car is around that much. expensive cars are like $100,000.00 to $500,000.00!
you have to be mental to buy a new car, early 2000's cars with good service history are perfectly fine and cheaper to maintain.
you should compare parts that are worn with use like oil and brake pads the majority of owners won't need to change these parts
first off, you're not supposed to use the touchscreen while you're driving. dude, that's just as worst as texting while driving!
great video. there is one auto company that plans to update the electronics in their cars as they age and that company is tesla.
great video. totally agree. that's why my mechanic advised me to keep my perfectly functioning toyota auris as much as possible.
i don't have to pay 42k. even with a hyundai elantra you could manage. for about half the price. and then this is used. come on!
i drove a 2014 chevrolet equinox and when i went to look over my shoulder to check my blind spot, i got a face-full of b column!
i'll never buy anything newer than 1999 0r 2000. recently bught a used 2013 mazda with all the electronic controlls, guess what?
keep buying cars before 2005 that will probably have already enough problems to solve, but they will be cheaper in the long run?
learn the basics of a car know what to look for and buy used, 2007 was ten years ago guys, there are a lot of good car from them
shiny metal meant shiny metal, leather was leather, plastic was plastic and wood was wood! , cars will never be as good as then!
so this moron complains about modern cars being unaffordable and yet is amused at the idea of keeping a phone more than 7 years.
technology on modern cars is good and bad. some things are really useful and some others are clearly done for marketing reasons.
the true essence and pleasure of driving a car lies in the simplicity of its manufacturing. because, all that glitter aint gold!
this is nonsense. there are several car models with the technophobe in mind. the infotainment systems are options for many cars.
this is typical leftist thinking. why would you have a family in the first place if you can't do basic math what can you afford?
too many computers. when they go bad it's cost a lot to fix and they got to be reprogrammed and recoded every time it's replace.
what about the few people who like to keep cars for 20+years. there's absolutely no hope for them, and that trend will soon die.
what are the lowest tech new model cars out there right now, and are any of them a great value vs. competitors loaded with tech?
you have made a video about a non-issue and just wasted yours and everyone else's. time having to sit through this utter drivel!
abs in many cases can cause an accident. are you really sure your airbag won't go off in a minor fender bender or off road jaunt?
between the government mandated safety devices and the gizmos to bedazzle the sheeple, modern cars are overpriced techno garbage.
both points have been true for a while but, the people who need to hear this the most are going to be the least likely to listen.
but everything your saying is what keeps the used car industry alive, and will keep some hondas going for years and years to come
fucking degenerate your whining makes absolutely no sense. buying a new car is stupid, even more if you can't actually afford it.
gimme a car with ac a decent stereo and speakers and a 5 or 6 speed. maybe power windows, maybe not. a new car, i’m talking 2018.
hauling, towing, plowing etc. yeah it had a smoother ride and better fuel economy, but when it came to doing real work it failed!
i don't know why you are using your computers and mobile phones. scratching on stones were enough to write down. fuck technology!
i have a 2011 volvo and i can go to a volvo dealership for a free software update so i'm not sure what this guy is talking about.
i know nobody that buys new cars. just buy them one or two years old. they cost less than half as much, and are still great cars.
i want the technology in the engine bay and the wheel well, not the cabin. that's why i admire the gtr, evo, and the sti so much.
i'm a motor tech and you're right on. a lot of people blame the mechanic because surely the manufacturer would never be at fault!
i'm on my 2nd $60k car. i have no problem paying for it or fixing them when they break. get a damn job and work. damn snowflakes.
i've said this about the technology for a long time why do so many people think it's good when a car comes with sat nav built in?
im amazed cars in your is only 4 to 5 years. 6:02 for me, 5 years using the car with care and maintenance is still as good as new
not really sold on your 1st argument. parts that have been developed 10 years ago are always cheaper than new ones on the market.
not to mention that the cars now are basically built like apple phones. just works until the insurance is over, then that’s that.
relax with the spastic flicking motions idiot. these systems work great. dont just jab at them trying to make them fail fuck head
remember the good old times when you had a big knob for the heat, one for the window, and maybe one for the stereo. nothing broke
that also means that the engine will last longer. the older cars last longer, look better and they have proven their reliability!
that's why all my cars are a minimum 20 years old, cost less then $2000, and parts i can find in the junkyard for next to nothing
they pack so much tech into modern cars that they become super expensive to buy new, then super expensive to maintain and repair!
been thinking this for a while,it will almost see out future classic cars too,i prefer old cars anyway so that's why i have an e34
check your math at 3:08. 1,857 is 36 percent not 27 percent more than 1,364. your points are correct, though, and very well taken.
his first column of cost of parts for the 2006 civic is only $967. which would make the 2016 civic parts about 92% more expensive!
i just got the whole engine replaced in my 1998 škoda felicia for literally 90 dollars. talk about a cheap car to buy and maintain
i've always bought used cars. paid them off immediately. they've lasted 10-12 years. you take care of them, they take care of you.
if you can't afford a 40k car then don't buy one. there are plenty of other options. capitalism is why your not having to pay 80k.
it is not capitalism, it is human stupidism, you have a brain and a free-will, you decide whether to use these technologies or not
it would be so much better to use. and with the amount of infoteiment systems installed it would be so cheep for car makers to buy
kids listen up, after you get the car, wife and family you'll understand this man. don't act like your one of those rich youtuber.
let madison, my 156 pound timber wolf ride with her head out the window. she also aids in accident avoidance, and theft deterrent.
my 2004 volvo has a label that says 'replace airbags x8 every 10 years' who the hell is going to replace $15000 worth of airbags??
simple if you cant afford all that gadgets take car without them like i did who need parking sensors,touch screen,led lights etc.?
taking out certain componentes that's going to cost down the road or removing it completely and going for a more simpler solution?
the best things about new cars is the panels are straight and it's safe in a crash, that's it, but i'll never buy a car over 1991.
the total for the 2006 civic is actually $967, not $1,364. that means the 2016 civic 48% more expensive to maintain, not just 27%.
this just convinced me to keep my 2002 toyota echo. no power locks, windows or computer. basic old fashion controls. easy, breezy.
bmw has an amazing center console for changing the volume and other stuff without looking at the center screen and it’s really cool
crazy. for the sake of style they ruin the driver's sight lines, and then sell you blind spot warning systems, back up cameras etc.
find out what the masses do buying new cars and do the opposite get a old car use this in everything in life you won't go far wrong
i agree. i own a ford falcon wagon 2003. i will never go later than that. and yes. when the time comes, i will not get another car.
it's to easy to fix for a mechanic so the charge you out of the ass for a laptop session with your car. that's the problem of tech!
life is short and summer is shorter. you bring up some great points about affordability, that said a car is a necessity in the usa.
my first car was €1000 and i maintained it myself. 2 updates and upgrades should be for the lifetime of the car. at least 20 years.
plastic parts, wiring, unreliability, new unreliable technology, price to buy, price to repair, the list goes on. buy an older car.
the biggest problem with cars today is the fact they have computers in them which in effect turns them over to control by the state
the life cycle isn't 4 to 5 years. it's more like 10. also there are plenty of value models. not everyone can afford the 40k model.
this guy is an absolute moron. did he honestly think a 6 digit income was just going to fall into his lap right out of high school?
this is why i'm keeping my 2006 maxima as long as possible. all this nanny shit is for the lazy ass inattentive drivers. blindspot?
you want to be safer? . govern all cars to 50 mph. fix cell phones so they do not work unless absolutely stationary. end of wrecks.
a friend at my local honda dealer told me that the cost to replace the lcd gauge cluster in the 2017 honda crv ex exl is over $3000.
cost around 1300 usd, is 30 years old, and willl drive atleast 10 more years with no problems p.s. my girlfriend is newer than my b4
my daughter just got a new car and she doesn't like it because there is just too much stuff in it, liked her old car better, simpler
my own vw polo 2012 has run only 70,000 km so far and it already has had a busted valve in the turbo 400€ and a busted ignition coil
pointless waste of money, materials, life. why dont we just have basic cars that get around and we can all spend less money on them.
so true. there's no money in reliability. i work in car parts. i drive a 30 year old car. still runs beautiful. air con still works.
the biggest problem with modern cars is they depreciate 70% of their value in 36 months see what a dealer offers you for a trade in.
the price is decided by ask and demand, when nobody can afford them they won't sell. but they are selling so people can afford them.
they also talk too much about the normal in car functions, i mean who cares about cup holders when you want to buy a performance car
barely any difference in the chassis and engine in a brand new 1 series. i will never buy a new car, even 10 years is too new for me!
can we go back to just backup camera, navigation, digital radio, cd playing and bluetooth for the features of an infotainment system?
don't go in debt. save your money and start with a small secondhand car. as special bonus they tend to come with no computer screens.
dude. this is what it is. btw did you know in that volvo screen you are showing a simple voice command can adjust most of the things?
i hate that everything is on a barely responsive touch screen, thats why i love my mk1 mx5 because its all simple mechanical switches
i hate touch screen hvac. for something you use all the time, i don’t want to go through menus to just adjust the temp by one degree.
i just hope there is enough critical voices out there to have an effect on the industry. keep up the good work, we need more of this.
i'd take the stock shit out and put in aftermarket. i dont need blindspot cameras, a quick look over the shoulders will do just fine.
it literally just screams cars are changing and i don't like that, you complain about cost and say 40 grand. the fuck are you buying?
its not as simple as unplugging it and restarting it like your laptop. the obsolescence of these new cars can be counted in one hand.
not every family needs a new car. they have always been very costly for middle class families. i agree with your second point though.
o lad's somone see old owner manual from 80's or 90 's compare to new audi a6 or mercedes fuck me the new one it's 1000 page book wtf
what i hate is unrefined drive by wire throttle in a manual transmission car, makes it impossible to rev-match or heel-toe downshift.
when my friend bought a new car off the dealership he keeps bragging about that new car smell and am like dafuq you bought a car for!
when you say manufacturers decided it seems like you are completely ignoring cafe standards that the federal government put in place.
you buy used, put up with it for awhile it's called sacrificing, save your money and then get the nice car. high-tech safety devices?
1999 toyota camry 4 cylinder, best car ive ever had. reliable as hell, cheap, just wants gas and basic maintenance. love the damb car.
also imagine if cars had a monthly bill and if it wasn't payed a tow truck would come to your house and take your car away and sell it
because companies don't make money by selling products that last for too long. simple as that. even overpriced ones. blame capitalism.
come to malaysia, a stupid corolla will cost you 120k. salary for fresh grad with degree will get 2.5k permonth. who's joking now heh.
everything i've ever thought about modem cars. thank you, more people should watch this. on there flat screens in their chevy malibus.
i believe people just need to learn how to drive. not specifically but especially when it comes to phones and this technology in cars.
just think of all the awesome old cars that were prematurely taken off the road when hussien obama did that cash for clunkers debacle!
most people are struggling to keep up with their modern cars, as i drive by them at the shop in a '49 dodge. i'm in my early 20's btw.
my fiesta has a knob to change the station and a manual gearbox and i wouldn't have it any other way. you can keep your ford my touch.
the biggest problem is that you can't work on them yourself. america lost a whole skill set. everybody used to work on their own cars.
the only auto makers who seem concerned about updating their tech are the ones who are making electric vehicles. why is this, you ask?
you would have to fork out an arm and a leg just to get it fixed. and with that being said, what mechanic would even want to fix this?
and that was the cheapest shitbox that was available, but it was new. why would you think you can afford a brand new car in your 20ies?
can't we just go back to something as simple as a volkswagen beetle but with some added safety with airbags and seat-belts, abs breaks?
i found one of the best radar+laser detectors on the market that won't destroy your bank account. you should checkout speeddemon360.com
i hate these cars packed with electronic gadget. if my phone last 3 years, my car will last 3 years if it has as much tech as my phone.
i love my old grand marq. only has 120k miles, runs super well, clean, and simplistic as hell. what happened to simplicity in vehicles?
i try to get a stripped version if possible. it is not easy and a stripped car today is better equipped than a loaded car 20 years ago.
if spending $40,000 on a car is a joke then buy a $20,000 car or better yet move to a city and skip owning a car. you are a complainer.
just buy a ~4 years old car, stop buying new cars you can't afford the only reason cars prices go up is because people keep buying them
lmao kickin it out in that genesis p @ i here the rpm kick catching that counter steer and who could miss the change in expression haha
new cars are all competing to have the most useless gimmicks, best gas mileage, and safety and epa regulations to appeal to the masses.
so much for sae certified mechanics. your next visit to a service station will look more like a trip to the doctor or dentist's office.
so the solution would be decentralisation. not putting a supercomputer in the middle, but many small ones, that only do their one thing
some very valid points in this video. addtionally im glad you hit on debt as well. these sheep will follow anything theyre told. so sad
the touchscreens are dangerous unless you're stationary, such as when at a red light or in traffic. that's my biggest bitch with those.
this video is absolutely ridiculous. oh you mean if i buy a car with more tech options i might have to pay to fix them when they break?
us car is already pretty cheap, if u can't pay for ur car there, u can't buy any in other market. don't u know how lucky for us market?
amen, you are so right, i never, never buy new cars. i can add anything i want to my car without the manufacturer adding it into my car.
buttons all of a sudden were deemed as being bad so navigating through a sea of menus and pointing and clicking through menus is better.
do not buy a car. always lease it. if u really want to buy something, buy a cheap honda or toyota etc. fuck those expensive german cars.
don't use it, unless you actually need it, and only then you just need something that just works. all you need is 30-40 miles per gallon
ford's pothole avoidance yeah you missed the pothole but you were yanked off your seat. and talking to your intelligent navigator.? ????
have a 2015 car its only got 16000 miles on it and it has built in sat nav to update the proprietary system its £260, so i use my phone.
if it's against the law to text & drive, why is it legal to have a computer in a car where you still have to type or use a touch-screen?
im sticking with the old cars as long as i can. when i gets to where i have no choice but to drive a modern vehicle, let the hacks begin
it isn't capitalism. it's capital-consumerism. there are capitalistic nuances, but it's all about you buying, buying, buying and buying.
some auto builder should make vehicles that are not computerized to the maximum, especially the screens in the dash that are distracting
subaru is pretty reliable and their cars hold their value well. was looking to buy one, a 2013 sti was selling more than a new 2016 wrx.
thank you for confirming what many of us think when we look at these vehicles. i drive a 22-yr. old miata btw. what's nice about my car?
the cars are also getting so much heavier. but i agree some of the tec stuff scares you when you think of them breaking in a short time.
the thing is, cars are about features now so that makes a 30k hyundai just as good as a 50k bmw. youre just paying double for the badge.
this is retarded. newer cars are a lot better, i don't even know where to start to explain how wrong you are about basically everything.
to me, anything bigger than a motorcycle is a family vehicle. if your girlfriend is not fine with your miata then it's time to break up.
traded in my computer on wheels for a good old reliably land rover defender 110, no bells or whistles, just pure function. zero regrets!
yeah you got that right. however it's why i went with mazda. simple enough to not bug out, and can be rooted due to being android based.
how about we put the fancy infotainment systems in the top level trims of basic cars and save all the fancy features for luxury vehicles.
i have a loaded 2009 infiniti fx35 with all the tech available at that time. true out dated but everything still works for the most part.
i have never had a car loan because i don't believe in debt but i have saved the money to buy a new car but they just don't appeal to me.
i've got a '99 bonneville sle, w on-steering-controls w00t!, whilst driving cross-country, ive navigated entire mp3-discs folders 'n all!
lol throwaway items. duh, no shit, they dont want you to keep the damn car. gotta buy again. you dont keep your broken cell phone do you?
makes me want to keep my very simple 05 suzuki aerio. hardly anything there that's fancy and repairing it is so easy. she's done me good.
man let me tell you something the problems you are talking about are only in the usa so service etc are not that expensive internationaly
next thing you know, cars, pickups, and suv's are gonna be mobile command centers with all this tech. houses will be a thing of the past.
people who can't get their vehicle fixed. all i can say to it, that's what you get when you choose your vehicle based on the cup holders.
planned obsolescence is one of the greatest scams in consumerism ever. incorporating it into automobiles is not healthy in the long term.
scott is my cup of tea, just saying. and you made me feel bad, cuz i just bought a 42000 car with monthly payment of 410. now i feel bad.
sounds like the hell tech that was packed in my 1990 buick lesebre that i had once few years ago. i bought the car for $50, it ran great!
take the bus or train, is really that simple, you don't have to have a car if you don't want to. except if you live in usa, then blame gm
these danged auto manufacturers wanted the computers installed so that they would be able to sell you more crap to keep them on the road!
today's cars can often run with just oil changes and lube for over 100,000 miles. use to be you needed service every three to six months.
well no one said during your 20s you should have a car and no one said you need to buy new, a car is a luxury, if you cant afford too bad
you save a lot of money in this regard by becoming a better driver, so you won't have to live in constant fear behind the stearing wheel.
and that is why i bought mid-modern cars and then i make or add new features to customize and make it safe and also system can be upgraded
driving a 2000 jeep base model cherokee. 210,000 miles. everything can be fixed by a decent back yard mechanic. i plan to keep it forever.
go back to the 90's level of techy stuff. camry 1992 was the cheapest car to own for me. i bought a basic 4x4 truck and it's way to techy!
how the fuck can someone accelerate and rear end someone, knowing they're right in front of them and they'll be at fault for the accident?
i drive a w124 mercedes benz. the car has everything i need and is cheap and reliable. wish the modern cars didnt fuck up that much aswell
i paid it off in 3 years, just to have to trade it back in for a vehicle that had these what i consider to be critical technology updates.
im running my 91 corolla ae 92 lol thats car is amazing,, still working,,, and less repair cost,, and btw i can lear a lot with my old car
it is all about reducing the lifecycle of a vehicle. it is about keeping all repairs in the dealerships. wait until cars are all electric!
no truer words have ever been spoken. i have been saying the same thing for years. thank you for this video. keep on trucking ghost rider.
some tech i can get behind though. the bluetooth phone connection with voice control and such. most of it though is just over priced crap.
the answer to most of this is dont buy a modern vehicle, buy an old timer and a shit load of spare parts and or a vehicle for spare parts!
these are my exact thoughts as i’ve been doing research trying to buy a used car. i do not want all of that horrible tech. so frustrating.
they have all this techno crap for people that cant drive and they still wreck. cars today are just very expensive disposable bic lighters
unless you break it yourself or somehow mess with your car if its a new car its going to have a warranty that will cover for like 5 years?
with a little bit of education you can make a car last. you may have to get a socket set and be a do it yourselfer but do what you can do.
would be interesting to see you team up with scotty kilmer for the mechanic review on modern cars discussing expensive technology repairs.
you keep cars three years?, aren't you special. i have three toyota's, one 22 one 20 and one 1 year old the two older ones have over 200k.
a video about how annoyingly distracting modern cars are. while driving a car in the snow. what is the point you were trying to make again?
adjusted for inflation, cars are cheaper than they were 20 years ago. on top of that, the same model today gets you a whole lot more stuff.
almost no one in their early to mid 20s makes enough to afford these things. especially when the average student loan indebtedness is $25k.
hey savagegeese, did you think the cars were made by manufacturers to give the customer a reliable, affordable economic driving experience!
i just removed my entire xdrive system for aftermarket. bmw wanted 2500 for an amplifier. the key is to take control with aftermarket stuff
if you're a dipshit and don't get it about the cost of new car technology and new car cost, have fun learning the hard way. or work harder!
in twenty years, following a massive oil crisis and a total collapse of the debt based monetary system.,, electric bicycles. yup. for real.
instead of focusing on keeping cars technology updated, lets pass laws banning touch screens in cars. touch controls in autos is dangerous!
just having this very same convo with a friend of mine the other day haha what about how much theses new cars weigh,the list goes on and on
my nokia phone stopped getting software updates 2 years after i bought it. it's still sufficient in terms of hardware. but now its a brick.
none of these cars with touch screens will ever be classics in the future. the way technology progresses they will look like shit in 20 yrs
only technology i want its ac and an automatic transmission, i can roll up my own windows don t need a back up camera power door locks ect.
they also look ugly as sin, every car looks like an angry robot. go ahead, try to find me a car that doesn't look like an edgy angry robot.
this is the best video about new cars. i thought i was getting to be an 'old fart', because i think that paying $50k for a truck is stupid!
yes but this in car tech is loved by the reviewers, at the expense of what the car is like to drive, it's not just the manufacturers is it!
you are so right. have you noticed that older cars and especially trucks have gone up in price. they run well, and no techniogy die on you.
you must buy a reliable car. buy japanese toyota honda vehicles. my lexus ls430 2001 has 275000 miles with original starter and alternator.
amen to the concerns about the infotainment systems in cars now. for so many of them, they look and feel dated now, let alone in 5-10 years.
buy an older car and a good quality toolkit with a workshop manual much cheaper. also there’s nothing wrong with a five year old smartphone.
i bought a 9 year old subaru forester xt and honestly i love it. the parts are cheap for the most part too except for the engine of course .
i live in the uk where you can live without ac in a car and purposely went out and got my last car without ac as it's less crap to go wrong.
i thought you said let's just say i nut in my mistress, and she said well, you know what, i need a family car for the kids, best mis-hearing
it's true, all this tech in modern cars is great, only because it's a couple years new, it hasn't had the test of time. no reliability test.
love your perspectives of things. i would like you to review an old car bmw e28, e31, 2002 etc what it feels in terms of many things. thanks
more the techie stuffs added in car, more stupid people become. how many of us would have relied heavily on gps 10-15 years ago to do a a-b?
right up until the brainbox dies. then it's straight to the boneyard for old betsy, she just can't get past the smog man any more. so adios.
this tech makes no sense. distracting screens. my sis car has one & i hate it. go thru menus just to turn heat on. change seat settings ect.
too much shit that's the reason why in a matter of fact you can't go wrong with a classic car maybe a 1965 ford mustang might be on my mind.
touch screens not only remove the tactile feel to operate basic controls of a car with your hands, it makes you take your eyes off the road.
well. i'm 22 and drive a 16 focus rs. find a good job work hard and you should be able to easily afford a vehicle if you make it a priority.
28 years in the business and same company i work for automotive. and i must say this video is right on. keep youre pre 2000s car if you can.!
also the visibility of the cars of those days, specially bmws ,mercs, jags, porsches, lan rovers, alfas, fiats were and still are unbeatable!
even though i have a smartphone i am tethered to a laptop for 2 reasons, 1 currently have no wifi, 2 phone has adware factory installed on it
i absolutely detest toyota entune so much i can't wait to unload my crappy 2016 avalon. just need to get through purchasing a new home first.
i miss bench seats. how am i supposed to do any lovin', touchin', squeezin' with a huge cup holder storage compartment between me and my gal?
luckily, he had an extended warranty. got rid of the car shortly thereafter. sad to say, when it comes time to get another car, i will lease.
most people are not good at evaluating the important aspects of a vehicle and are sold on the bells and whistles dvd players and cupholders .
problem #3 is that you can hardly look outside anymore. a-pillars fat enough to hide a truck from view, and even less visibility to the back.
sounds like a whinge-fest from someone who wants but can afford the latest hi-tech cars. so go and buy a second-hand one. easy. what a whiner
that's why i buy older cars. get e 15yo decent popular car with plenty of parts available original and aftermarket, fix it up and you're good
the software that cars use are sooo slow like they really didn't even try to make a decent software for cars they just kinda slapped in there
there is nothing wrong with modern cars. there is something wrong with poor and stupid people who account for most of the world's population.
they are not built to keep, they are built to recycle easier, like most things these days, from phones to cars, they have a limited lifespan.
yeah i’ll stick with my 05 mustang gt, simple car to drive, no distracting screens. i hate these modern cars with all this useless technology
you i hate seeing people turning over cars every three years. car manufacturer you're right thats far too long, how can we make it two years?
2010 gti. got month ago. 52k miles. gonna do what i did with my last 02 grand prix. run it into the ground. get a good 6 to 10 years out of it
a good reason to buy used that are over 5 years. most of the problems they will run into in the first 5 years have already been taken care of.
as someone who lives in a climate where 5 months of the year you need to wear gloves, capacitive touchscreens and buttons in cars need to die.
cvt and turbos goddamn i was so happy with my yaris u til i wrecked it got a 17 civic base i don't see it lasting more than 200k like my yaris
i am looking at a stripped down 2.5 l mazda 3 because on paper i get the best deal and i don't care about technology so much. i want to drive!
i have solution for everyone who agrees with savagegeese. get a lada from russia. you wil get cheap car, less electronics, probably no safety.
i just get in and drive and i turn a knob for volume or hit a button on my steering. oh, and i put the key in the ignition to start the motor!
i like older honest simple cars anyway i like my car to be mechanical, and i like to drive it all on my own i do not like computers on wheels.
joke's on you, i've got a '91 car that i got for 300 euro. manual crank windows, manual locks, no power steering, 5 speed 75 hp and everything
lol this is so true. sure, some brands will be more reliable than others, however, more expensive brands usually also have more gadgets in 'm.
my 21st century automobile concept is so revolutionary that until the trademark is ironed out in 5 countries the concept, well you understand.
next time you create a video you might want to see why some of this tech is on cars. government mandates. abs, backup cameras, telemetry. etc.
the problem isn't modern cars. its the cars people pick in the modern era. know what you are buying and make sure you have done your research.
touch screens in cars made me loss concentration likely i avoided the crash never touching them while driving again its irony tho to have them
you cant buy a car for less than $25k now. you pay $400-600 a month for 5-7 years, and it starts to fall apart in a year, and its all plastic!
and that's why i'll never buy new or modern. when i heard of infotainment i said screw it, i'd rather have and old dog that an an unproven pup.
cars have been always throw items. they're machinery. that's it. nothing more. cars back in the day were even more throw away compared to today
i bought a '66 bug for a 1000$ a couple of years back, it serves me perfectly. running costs aren't even that much in comparison to newer cars.
i can't fucking stand my phones touch screen, why in the hell would i want one in a car, i'm fine with my 1990 dodge ram thx, but no thanks lol
i dont like any technology in cars, there is only 2 things cars i had and will have over the years will have big engine and manual transmission
i love that you talked about used 2016 civic. i'm also terrified. everything in that car is going to be so expensive when it eventually breaks.
i spent 3k on the grand marquis and it is big enough for a family car and has a good safety rating. it has it's cons, but buy better used cars!
i was looking at some late 90’s-early 2000’s corvettes and asked my friend for his opinion on it, he said “it doesn’t even have a touch screen.
most people with newer cars are leasing or financing. as long as its reliable for 3-5 years and you can afford the monthly payments, who cares?
that's why i drive my 01 bmw 5 series and travel in luxury and performance without all the bullshit and the parts are cheap and i fix it myself
the first major manufacturer that catches on and produces a car without all the electronic horseshit is going to make phat loot, mark my words.
this is why i bought an older volvo. fuckers a tank and theres little to no infotainment distraction, little in the way of electronics to fail.
watching the volvo touch screen part is cringing how slow and unresponsive it is. and every damn reviewer cant say enough good things about it.
wow, there is no way that white car should have done that. the driver probably slammed on the brakes and i don't see him her correcting at all!
at the same time i was very impressed how reliable the automatic high-beam function worked, it always turned off high beam for oncoming traffic.
cars are already powerful enough an extra increase in horsepower seems unnecessary. maybe cars should be made every two years instead of yearly.
cars are more expensive today but also way more reliable then before and plus in 2017 its so much easier to make money then it was back in 2006.
for that and a few others things i don't buy these new cars but old cars and prefer to recondition them, a lot better for me that these new cars
have been looking for something to replace my much loved but very old 240 volvo there is nothing out there that is not filled with electronic bs
i am in my 30s and i still drive a 1999 honda that just hit about 150,000 miles on the odometer. i don't need a new car. i don't want a new car.
i don't want that bullshit on my wheels. i want my car to last, the less modern bullshit it has, the more it will last, that's my point of view.
i havent even seen the whole video and i already like it so much that i supscribed. theres so much truth in ehat youre saying i love analog cars
just buy an old japanese or american car. 1997 honda crv, no touch screen, very cheep to fix, somewhat low on gas, cost from $500 to $3000. done
man you whine a lot. yeah, cars have not changed for the better in at least ten years, but you can explain this without whining like an old man.
my subaru has literally no frills. the best feature it has is a bluetooth head unit, which i installed. if it has nothing, nothing can go wrong.
own a 1998 toyota. cost me virtually nothing in parts apart from usual service items. hope to keep it on the road for at least another 10 years.
that is why in car gps is such a joke. wifi in the car. your phone already does that. why add an item to your cell phone bill you don't have to?
all this stuff is nice, but why don't they modularize these systems as stand alone systems, so if they stop working you can still drive your car?
also you notice how laggy car infotainment systems are. i mean if a little 500 phone can be snappy cant car manufacturers make a snappy interface
best cheap used reliable car is the crown victoria grand marquis town car. nothing will out last them and they don't have all this bullshit in em
but in the good old days when your transmission had an issue. we heard a loud rattle and couple miles later you blew the fucker to the next life!
i chose it for that goddamn audio system. forced obsolescence on something which cost me £7500 is not acceptable and should lead to class action.
i drive a car build in 2001 still fine, its not pretty anymore kida 3rd generation used, i own it for a year and sofar only had to change a bulb.
i have a 1988 subaru 1.8 l series 386.000 km on the counter. it has only neaded some normal wear parts and fuel and oils. never going to sell it.
i would not put anything in the back of a $60k truck. oh and i have no electric anything in my jeep, saves weight and no potential future issues.
looks like the shill astroturfing assholes are out in full effect on this video. probably car companies trying to do social media damage control.
no bumpers, to many electronic gadgets, they are way too expensive, parts are far too expensive, and they have too much plastic instead of steel.
people need to realise that when manufacturers put all this gimmick shit in cars 'for driver safety', no no no its to make people stupid as shit.
that is why i drive a 02 cavalier. it is reliable and if parts do fail they are easy and cheap to replace. i can easily afford a new car but why?
this is why i don't buy new cars. i buy used and i buy older. new cars are increasingly a scam. if more and more people do what i do. guess what?
visibility in new cars is garbage. all the airbags in the pillars and doors are making cars unsafe. the crash that is prevented saves more lives.
while i totally agree with all this, i gotta mention that the volume knob in my 2001 sunfire is true analog and has barely worked for a long time
you're right about the infotainment systems. they really are what dates a car right now, and are a big part of why people flip cars so regularly.
if cars weren't getting better technology and better safety systems hen there would be no development and then everybody would be complaining too.
isn't that obvious it's vest consumer demand for something new + competition that's driving manufacturers to add countless new features each year!
more and more cars are made to be leased. it's a fact of life. between the shit reliability and all these lease specials, this is what you'll get.
nobody asked for any of this shit. all you need is to get from point a to point b with good visibility and the ability to focus on the road ahead.
scott was super helpful. i'm so glad you left that in this video because without scott's insight, i wouldn't understand the concept of this video.
that's a joke, the market is a joke. make those cars for people who can't drive but please leave a market for those who care about how they drive.
they were only taking home $575 per month. this is true for any year you want to pick. new cars were always for the rich, successful, and the old.
what about the fact that all cars will be driverless eventually. driving will be a thing of the past. i wonder what will happen to motorbikes tho.
being poor is natures way of telling you to either work more or improve your skills. get cracking. life is hard. too bad. #2 cant afford a 40k car?
expensive, and just about 70% of people have 6 + year loans now. no way man. i bought a used grande marquis 4 years ago for 6k and she's been good.
i feel like my 21-year-old 4runner is high-tech because i don't have to crank the windows down by hand. i plan to drive it for the rest of my life.
i guess this is a typical millennials argument at the evils of capitalism. i agreed with most of this video excluding the anti-capitalist nonsense.
i have a 1910 ford model t. best car ever. if something breaks i fix it. and i don't need to buy 1000's of dollars worth of parts to fix it either.
i have a 2003 pontiac sunfire. it was my dad he had since brand new. the car has no problems and never gave any problems just routinely maintenance
i would be interested to know, in a nutshell, what the break at 2005 is for you. is that when the infotainment climate controls became commonplace?
lobby to get high class public transport. eco zero emissions trams and urban rail metros will stop the car curse. do everything to discourage cars.
modern cars are expensively overengineered. tons of pricey crap inside which barely serve any real purpose. that's why i am sticking to my classic.
people never buy a car in full. that is how people operate these days. some people got it, but most of the people i see change cars ever 2-5 years.
several cars announce this on the screen and say for just passengers to use, and physical components often still exist, accompanying physical ones!
some cars wont even start if you have a problem to one of the subsystems that it is not even vital to the car performance or safety of polution exc
the problem with this system is no spare part after 8 years, or hell expensive, i prefer no need these system, i can get all these on a smart phone
when i drive my 991.2 gt3, i shut off the radio, turn on sport exhaust, and open the window, that's how driving should be. i don't need those tech.
wow he has a point, that technology highly distracts drivers. how about i just buy a car with no features, a first trim to keep it more simplified.
2002-2006?. i'm driving an 02 x5 with 184k miles, looking for something more reliable in a mid sized suv, want to spend $5-10k max. any suggestions?
biggest problem is cars still have antique engines that has a sytem that is more then 100 years old and people think we live in a modern age of tech
cars that won't let you turn off stability and traction control piss me off so much, the car will literally not let you get bent even if you want to
great refreshing option. i think the problem with cars is they don't work on short journeys. emissions, fuel economy are dreadful on a 2 mile drive.
it's especially true of high end vehicles and even mechanics have said it. who needs an obd fault code for a burnt trunk light, like on a mercedes?!
so great cause its 100% secure! , then in terms of handling its better than almost any car i've driven, this one takes curves at 150km h no problem!
thanks i thought i was one of few who thought this and i have tried to explain these problems to family members friends but they still buy a new car
that's why i'll stick with my 1996 chevy blazer 4x4. still gets just about the same gas mileage as these new ones and is probably twice as reliable.
this is also why my daily is a 84 d100 slant 6 4 speed. it’s paid for its self so many time i couldn’t count. they don’t make them like they used to
this is why people hate car repairs. the 'technology' just stays the same, no one cares about the stereo lcd technology, nor is it a big salespoint.
too much electronics too much to go wrong that's what's wrong will all modern cars i bought a quadbike in the end with hardly any electronics on it.
u forgot about how the car is made and how that makes repair time longer and more costly. exp. replace p pump on a mini cooper, step 1 remove engine
well as i agree with your statements, i still don't get why you even invited that mechanic to your video idea was that he will make that short joke?
also, the driver has to be well-trained in driver's education that we don't need in a vehicle, like blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning.
dude our toyota auris is barely 3 years old in top shape but the on board gui is so fukin dumb, the scroll buttons work backwards, hows that?????????
for radio and climate buttons please. screens for cameras or gps are great, or show somethings with the car, but please not for everyday first things
i love this channel because i am very annoyed with modern vehicles as well. so much tech you don’t need and which subtract to the driving experience!
i spent 50k on school loans this year. they’re gone now, so i guess i could afford a 50k car. that’s why i’m looking in the 15k range. fuck car debt.
i work at a new car dealer and you have no idea how expensive it is to replace this electronic bull when you're off the warranty and it stops working
if you're going to put that kind of crap in cars, at least optimize it so it doesn't look like your trying to run windows 10 on a computer from 2001!
just give me old 80s or 90s car with good automatic transmission and it's golden. change fluids and oils when needed and the shit will not break ever
maybe the apps are created so that when someone is parked they can look for a place to go you dumb shit and yeah technology changes we all know that!
my 2 cents. never go in debt for a car. every car i buy is with cash. i drove a beater for 4 years and saved up 15k and bought a nicer car with cash.
what manufacturers should do is go back to basics and get rid of all the computer stuff and make it simple to operate and fix, like the older models.
wow someone actually capable of calling out capitalism, i give you massive props for that, most are too scared to comment as clearly as you did here.
you can’t rely on technology. they may be great, but they’ll cost an arm or a leg when they break. that’s why i’m still driving my 1967 morris minor.
and if you can't afford to repair your vehicle then shouldn't be buying a new one in the first place get yourself some raggety ass 1999 toyota corola.
anything past 2005 is trash from a technology perspective. give me manual everything, get rid of 99% of the electronic crap that i don't need or want.
buy cars that are at least 10 years old. they are cheap fun, maybe not economical and repairing might cost you, but learn to fix the shit by yourself!
here's an idea buy a car that will cost less than 15% of your total income and have an emergency fund to have it fixed when it acts up or breaks down.
hey im here to pick up my car. oh the brake drums are shot and you need a new transmission. all i wanted was an oil change. lol quoting the mask hold!
i have a 2008 audi a4 and that will probably be the most luxurious car i will ever own. no tech. manual transmission. no turbos. it’s better this way.
manufacturers don't determine what safety feature needs to be in a car. that job belongs to the nhtsa national highway traffic safety administration .
modern cars infotainment systems, navigation displays, and screens that look outdated from the first day you own the car. and this adds a ton of cost.
motherfucking navigation system data dvd drive died in my 14 year old car and now i can't set the time on the goddamn clock. it's like $600 to replace
nobody is making you use all those things while driving. pull over if you wanna use the touch screen if you think you should not use it while driving.
so let me get this straight, you don't have the capability to use the touchscreen in your car, when you're parked in a parking lot, or at a red light?
sorry but cost should not be an issue, cars are expensive if you can't afford a new one get an old banger that is cheaper, and has less tech on board.
that's why i bought a frs bitch basic as fuck and the most fun car to drive i have ever owned it's also so good on gas don't fucking care if it's slow
that's why they make cars like the honda fit, toyota yaris, mitsubishi whatever, nissan versa, chevy volt, etc. or how about buying a cheap used car??
too fast is the answer no one ever needs to get to 60 mph in 3 seconds. no one needs to go over 90mph or less, why have cars that go 155mph or more? ?
what about e-handbrakes and the convenient but detrimental automatic transmission?, and in more recent cases, the often misinterpreted autopilot mode?
$240.00 repair. first repair in 20 years of operation. and i have had to replace a headlight bulb last year. only tires and oil. brakes last 6-7 years.
anyone stupid enough to by this crap deserves what they get,gm is absolutely the biggest scam out there,buy a old pre 72 gm or a rear wheel drive volvo
gee, i don't know how i managed to drive for the past 58 years without an accident i might add without infotainment. thanks again. now get off my lawn.
god bless those idiots who turn over their cars every 3 yearsthey make it possible for me to purchase incredible cars for a fraction of what they paid.
i bought it for the exact two reasons listed in this video it was cheap and it was simple. cheap and simple cars are going away. get one while you can.
if you had the option to walk away then don't complain about it. these days people are getting vehicles because it has a bunch of pretty buttons in it.
that's why classic cars are more fun to drive and also that's why modern cars will never become classics with the same meaning as today's classics are.
things wouldn't be so bad if auto mechanics and electricians were made to fix cars properly' instead of just taking your money for bringing the car in.
this guy clearly is an idiot and knows nothing about what he is talking about. he is wrong in so many ways. apparently progress and freedom scares him.
your income must be soooooo shitty. or else you're a super tightwad. you complain way the hell too much about money. try focusing on making more money.
a 7 minute video and half of it says 'don't buy a new car if you can't afford it' if you already don't realize that. you need alot more than this video.
also there has been some problems with the rear ac system not working and building up water, but that can be fixed by putting in a larger diameter hose.
and then there is the land cruiser. bomb proof and lasts 25 years. buy and restore a hdj81 or import hdj80 turbo diesel from japan and live like a king.
have an emergency fund for car repairs and other unplanned expenses, so that you don't have to do something financially stupid just to stay on the road.
i subscribed to this channel after watching oil choice video and then this is the second video i watched and i am unsubscribing because of the language.
if she didn't even know that her sunroof could tilt up, how the fk are ppl gonna figure out how to use their touch screens with a million options on it?
mercedes benz solved the issue of throw away cars when they introduced the w123 series in 1977. the w123 is the car for someone who wants a forever car.
moderns cars are cheaper more reliable more safe and have better features than ever. anyone who complains is basically bitter at other things, not cars.
my moms 2010 mazda cx-9 has those features. unfortunately, bluetooth seems kinda broken. but there’s always the 3.5mm audio input. but hands free calls?
only make stick shift cars. then idiots can't be on their phones cause they need both hands, or they're so incapable, they won't drive. everybody lives.
the funniest thing about all this new tech they're stuffing to car's has been around since the 50's basically they just polished it to make it seem new.
the reason why i go as basic as possible. i rather have a vehicle without all the computer stuff, with an actual key and without the start stop feature.
to afford a 40.000 dollar car your living in your parents home our pulling 150.000 at least to swing a home and car a year more than a 15hr car mechanic
what an irony. i will only believe in you if you don't use a car. in my opinion just close your mouth this is my freedom of speech, god bless the world.
1990 crx, that's all i need. new cars look cool but their more of a gimmick now. was thinking of getting a crz but figured my cars bad ass fuck new cars.
agree. but average car buyer mainly is amazed about shiny things and comfort, so emotions dominating over common sense. besides. its about prestige also.
bullshit i have a touch system in our car and i don't touch the screen when driving if i wanted to find a restaurant i would set the unit before driving.
buy an ugly classic. it's easy to fix,parts are plentiful or even rebuildable. but good luck trying to park your 1978 eldorado in a modern parking space.
could not agree more they are trying to make them disposable they were lasting too long my 2001 disco still drives ok this would drive manufactures broke
dont like modern cars, dont buy one. plenty of older cars with less tech out there. let the new cars filled with technology for the people who want them.
every time i see one of these car reviews i think holy cow, all that crap is going to break. my 2004 mazda is bad enough. things that can't go on, won't.
i agree with you. imo, the two things would be #1 -- they force the technology on you. you don't need fog lamps, backup cameras and voice-activated apps!
i don´t get why people buy new cars that cost so much. just buy a used car. even 500€ can get you a decent car that will get you from point a to point b.
i like when there are three knobs- how hot you want it. -how much you want it. -and where you want it. but nooo, you have to make that shit touch screen!
i'm 20, drive a car from 1970. i can tell you where and what every nut and bolt is for on that car. yet i couldn't figure out ford's infotainment system.
i've never in my life paid more than 4.5%, and with some basic negotiation, i'm currently paying 3.2% i live in scandinavia. you know, socialist hell -_-
it's to often prevent major damage to important components of your vehicle. when your engine light goes on, it could be something stupid and often it is!
my 2006 ford mondeo feels like a decent car after all. cheap to buy, cheap to run, cheap to fix, drives well, lots of space, no electronics to break down
technology is a good option. if car companies were aloud to sell carbeurated cars with no computers and shit, they would be so cheap and easy to work on.
fortunatly you can still find cars with phisicall buttons nowadays, just avoid buying big screen cars so manufactures understand this big anoying mistake.
i hate how they throw in all these safety features on a car that weighs over 2 tons, is on shit chinese tires, has tiny brakes, and weak as fuck sway bars
i think the problem is that people like this guy plan on making 10$ hr for the rest of their lifes and dont plan on growing financially negative thinkers.
if it doesn't have physical buttons to control the basics like climate, i won't buy it. i just want the scree to handle music or nav and leave it at that.
if you really wanted technology you could hook up any old car radio in a few minutes. h & v was by pull cables and to navigate you simply read road signs!
ive been told they design modern vehicles to be shit so people end up getting new ones 4 years later. all to make more profits by creating throwaway cars.
r u crazy. i have a 2004 and i'm going to dread having to get a newer car. fixing a new car is ridiculous. like some gms headlights paying up to 3 hours??
slowly morphing my 03 z71 suburban into a vehicle i want and like. which is starting with a very simple good base and can become anything i want it to be.
spot-on they don't sell cars anymore. manufacturers sell dept. trouble is people think new is better. buy a good quality classic and enjoy motoring again.
this video was made near the end of the obama era, aka the new normal. no wonder this guy was completely demoralized. get ready to afford these cars, bro!
us car companies are about to die. they employ and provide up to 5% oi the us workforce and gdp. it will be ugly and it's coming very soon. greedy morons.
you are spot on regarding new vehicle pricing and repair costs. this is why i'm still driving a 1997 grand marquis sorry i didn't mean to make you jealous
your support to use your voice to control most of the app. or your passenger can type for you. if your lucky you can go to the dealer for software update.
bought a $45k jeep grand cherokee in cash a couple years ago when i was 23. not that hard to afford you just need to get the right skills to pay the bills!
debt is what keeps the rich and powerful. rich and powerful. it's like introducing heroin to a person. once they're hooked the money just keeps rolling in.
exactly why 2003 to 2005 is the newest car i'll ever buy. i'll rebuild my tbird and buy an 88 cutlass supreme rebuild both for less than a brand new taurus
great video. i have an 11 year old tom tom that i still use. they want to charge you $899 for a navigation system when you can go buy a new tomtom for $75.
i drive my 1999 acura tl and just laugh at the people around me in their 2015 2016 cars. i believe 1999 was the last year of the good low maintenance cars.
i've given up trying to make the microsoft sync radio work on my transit connect. i just don't listen to music any more. but at least it has a volume knob!
learn the difference between affect and effect. hint average consumers are never effected by modern cars. why do you think you need to spend $42k on a car?
most cars to utilize the touch screen is done from the steering wheel. if it requires typing on the screen it won't let you do it until the car is in park!
move back to mechanical buttons and knobs. minimal infotainment software. if & when fully autonomous vehicles arrive, then the touch controls can be added.
much of the younger generation of people earn a lot more money than people used to make. i work with many recent college graduates who earn $90k+ per year.
no wonder why this has so many dislikes. this makes no sense. at all. newer cars are safer, more efficient, and even cheaper. this is just too pessimistic.
people, especially younger people fawn over all the tech and the idea of driverless cars and then complain they can't afford it. well, what did you expect?
this is why i have an ae86 hatchback and why i have 1980's cars, sure modern cars are good for comfort but retro cars are more for styling and performance.
this overly tech cars is pretty 1st world problem. here in india car manufacturers are robbing us with shit unsafe cars with no regulations from government
what an idiot. cost of vehicles have not gone up over the years when you take into account inflation. also, modern cars are way more reliable than old cars
couldn't we then just agree the 5'6 is useless and too short for a full-size truck and then move to a 5'9, 6'3, and 6'9 selection in addition to the 8' bed?
entertainment wise, i would need 1. am fm radio 2. aux port 3. good speakers. what's the point of the navigation system when everybody is using their phone?
i have a 1980 camaro z28 as a relaxation car. so nice to unwind without the tech and just drive. what would you suggest in terms of buying a base model car?
i love tech, i build computers, i fix stuff. but i hate all the new electric crap in the car. i am 29. and iam holding on to my 05 corolla as long as i can.
i totally agree with you on this man. i wish more people would vote with their money rather than settling for the 84 month payments to be able to afford it.
i understand why tesla does the whole screen thing. their car is a smart device that's constantly changing, but a bloody kia, or the infamous my ford touch?
i want companies to atleast create models of a car, with none of the modern tech bullshit and a fraction of a cost. who gives a shit about touch screen gps?
in australia of u earn enough money u can buy a new car every year and claim it all on tax. pretty much a free car every year, a lot of people here do that.
in my state the newer the car the higher the registration and insurance. so i buy 10+ year old cars with over 100-200k miles it to save money. never buy new
my 05' volvo s60 has useless gps because my phone replaces it but the best part about it is that the thing retracts into my dashboard when i'm not using it.
seriously my dude, cut the dramatics. if you can't afford to keep a newer car then just buy an old one with fewer electronics, the world is not going to end
that was depressing think i'll sell the xkr and buy a 1980's ford escort! . just remembered how shit they were. think i'll keep the jag untill it goes bang.
that's why i still drive my 2003 mazda mpv v6 lol and i still have a collection of cds haha one guy told me to update my entertainment system i said hell no
we need to bring back pe, auto shop, real driving tests, track timed skill based!, cooking skills processed food dumb person after 20 years of consumption .
ya, but it's not as bad as you're portraying it. fancy tech is optional, and the maintenance isn't really all that bad if you buy a reliable car. buy a kia?
and, the black boxes in carsthey know everything you doeven if you don't do anything wrong, they can alter info to find you guilty of something if they want.
any automobile made after around 1999 is disposable and they were made that way so you will buy a new one instead of paying exorbitant prices to repair them.
i agree with you 100%. none of that stuff electronics is necessary. please, let's go back to the days when you could order a car with the options you wanted.
it is better to just lease a car this day in age. just give it back every three years. it will never be your car but at least most repairs are on the dealer.
it really helps to don’t use your hands to interact with distracting stuff. you can for example texting messages to your friend through iwatch while driving.
most ill pay for a car is $500 because if it doesnt work i can fix it myself and make it last forever my 87 honda crx has turned over and still runs like new
people need to decide on what they need with their wallets. i can't tell you the plethora of quality used cars out there that you can pay cold hard cash for!
tell me something new. of course gasoline vehicles are the absolute worst decision possible. people need to be realistic and stop purchasing petrol vehicles.
too much electric applications and components you don't even use at all. why can't we just have a normal fucking car like a '95 civic hatchback or something.
why isn’t all the tech crap optional packages, that you can pick and chose what u want, for me it ends with power windows, power steering and brakes and a c.
you couldnt be more correct about all of these facts. i am going to purchase a brand new 95 accord ex sedan 5spd. this one of my favorite cars and gues what?
2 you complain that they won't update the sw after 3-4 years all the cars i have have had upgrades till age of 10-ish, but if you don't care, why do you care?
27% more expensive is not really a lot, it's only 7% more than inflation and the civic has moved decidedly upmarket in that time so it's a really bad example.
i have a volkswagen jeta from 2009,brand new i didn't have any problems at all with it, in 7 years 108.000 km,and is still as good as the first day i drove it
i would consider myself at least middle class and i can't afford them. i'm not taking out a huge loan for it. even the used suvs and trucks are too expensive.
ill save you all the time explaining the least favorite things in modern vehicles, one-they are all pieces of shit and two the people driving them are idiots.
liked the video, but id like some suggestions on how to avoid this as a consumer. what cars can you buy that arent going to be paired with so much technology?
lol you can lease a nissan altima for like 200 no money down if you have good credit. if you are tight with money, stop having babies you cannot afford. dinks
new cars are not bad just shop them a year or two later then you save big and do your own oil and save up for future repairs. cars old and new are money pits.
no one wants them because theyre not cool and they made millions. get a 5 or 6 year old one and pay cash. put a few bucks into it,it will last 10 or 15 years.
so look at a tesla. radically simplified drivetrain, modular and replaceable parts. regular software update over the air. car functions can be added via wifi.
that's 10k less than the ford mustang gt 2016 brand new. you're talking about rich people cars to ordinary people. buy a used 2007 car for 9k, problem solved.
this is so true and i am a victim of this. i have a pathfinder 2010 se and the display is blacked out. it's gonna cost 3200 usd to get it fixed with a new one
this video is so incredibly whiny. i resent youtube for suggesting it. i love my 2015 sentra. i love the technology. i love turning over cars every 3-5 years.
unsafe is when your attention is anywhere but on the road so why do manufacturers continue to put all these gadgets inside their cars. they are a distraction.
be a bit smarter and buy a car that does have tactile controls and take some responsibility and don't be playing around with touchscreens while you're driving!
cars already read signs and could limit the speed. nonsense but $$$$$$ is al they want i dont get those awfull infoteiment systems, cant they install a tablet?
how many people used porn when you had to look around and then quickly duck into a dirty book store to buy a hooter mag, when all you need now is the internet?
i want a car that is reasonably comfortable, reliable, and has a god damn 675 hp motor with touch screen on every surface. is that too much to fucking ask for?
just with wheels, smallest engine, manual 5-speed transmission, without air-conditioning, infotainment system, all manual, with manually operated side windows?
modern cars, probably the biggest scam going around at the moment. their life cycle is basically as long as their warranty and if yours is 3 yrs then bad luck.
not long ago, the goal of car ergonomics was to make every control recognizable by feel, so you wouldn't have to take your eyes off the road. so much for that.
oh geez. just sell your vehicle and go give mouth-to-mouth with some geese. actually, the biggest problem with modern cars are the f**king idiots driving them.
that's why i picked a car model with the least tech fitted. as well as fact that i'm a former electronics engineer as well so will save a fortune in the future
this is why i own a 1968 dodge monaco 500 and a 1969 dodge dart i hate new cars. my car's never need to be smoged i can fix anything that goes wrong with them.
what gets me if you want safety but reliabily long term you are almost sol. the newer cars have all the crash structure requirements but they toss in the tech.
yeah hate modern cars a lot. today it looks more like a cockpit from an air plane. all those damn bright lights and switches to and beeps is soooo distracting.
you don't buy a $40k car when you are 20 unless you came from money. for the rest of us, you start at the bottom and hopefully work your way up over time. duh.
$40,000. that's a basic car in australia. corolla cost about $24,000 mazda cx-5 about $45,000 base model 3 series cost $65,000 you guys in america have it easy!
a great video and your point of view is brilliantly put. i own 3 older cars for pretty much the reasons you have discussed. and i own all of them. not the bank!
any modern car that has a touch screen can be replaced with a android touch screen and yes android can control all the stuff that the original touch screen did.
anyway, in 50 years the entire automotive market will be exclusively electric powered adding another layer of inflation and complication to the entire industry.
great video, couldn't agree more. this is why i love 90's hondas. simple, clean, fun, great driving dynamics, bulletproof and cheap to fix when things go wrong.
i drive an older car because i'm tired of paying through the nose to repair it and still try to pay my mortgage, i rather have a nice home than a brand-new car!
i have a phone that are allmost 8 years old it works good but i have now a samsung galaxy s6 but i used it for 8 years and it looks like it was bought yesterday
i still have the stock cd cassette stereo that came stock with my 4runner. i'm waiting for one of my nephews to say something. they are still too young to care.
it seems to me this moaning little bitch will moan about everything, two simple rules, if you cant afford it, don't buy it, if you don't need it, don't have it.
my 2014 dodge durango has dial controls for the heating, and music and whatnot but also has a touch screen. but the touch screen is forsure way too distracting.
not to mention in-house mechanics at mega-dealers killing local mechanic shops at crazy mark-up because the cars are more computer than they are ice components.
the automotive manufacturers do not want to make cars that you can work on yourself. take a car from the 70s. you could work on that in your garage. cars today?
yes, of course. but they're also considerably more reliable. back in the day, cars were considered paperweights if they hit remotely close to 100k miles. today?
you forgot about one thing, i.e., the lack of bumpers. instead, there is a decorative piece of plastic which becomes dented if you even touch something with it.
you should use fireplace instead of heavy and complex heating system like boiler because now these heating systems are so costly that a fireplace is way better!
as for repairs, keep up with diy maintenance instead of just drive drive and drive. if i can learn and do most of the maintenance work at home why can't anyone!?
carplay apple or android doesn’t let you use anything but maps, voice-to-text, and phone, and they all tell you to pull over to use unless you are the passenger.
cars are cheaper than ever. reliability had become muchhhh better. my bmw f30 is 6 years old with 100k miles. just changed a few light bulbs and wipers. thats it
i agree with everything he has to say in this video. in 2013, i bought a brand new base model chevy spark. it's about as spartan as you can get for a modern car.
i drive a 93 geo prizm aka toyota corolla. it is the best car ever built. if your fancy 2016 car is still running 23 years from now, like my geo is, let me know.
i see from the interwebs that the average american spends $32k when they purchase a new car. that for the average american. $32k. thirty two fucken kaaaaayyyyyy!
i wish that i could get a modern mid sized vehicle with decent power without all the tech. all i need is a bluetooth system and maybe a backup camera. that’s it.
it's why i still but chevy. only thing technology wise on my car is the radio. don't use that for the most part cause what's worse than today's cars is the music
more people should get motorcycles. they are pretty simple electrically and they are super easy to fix yourself. you can even buy a carbureted motorcycles still.
on the spot!. right on!. i would add also technicians at dealers and other garages most of time are not able to understand and or repair the newer cars properly.
the more simple, the better. all the rest is sales, marketing etc or future-based conspiracy of artificial intelligence to get less human in the world of things.
we need to stop researching all this useless shit in cars, and instead research making cars able to actually exist when we start running out of gas in the world.
best cars are late 90s early 2000s, they are the prettiest cars that work and run best without safety features and dying tech slowing them down. for the most part
great point. i really agree about cars being too expensive for most people. and i'm glad to see that consumers are starting to wisen up and say no to the markets!
i hate how modern cars have made themselves self-contained bubbles where the occupants are so insulated from reality that it becomes distracting in and of itself.
if u need a family car and u dont have the money. buy a used car u sack of shit. it's common sense. a good example is 2006-2010 hyundai sonata used costs less 5k.
jesus fucking christ. it either works or it does not. there is no need to update the radio if it works. sheesh. why would you want to update any stuff in the car?
so frustrating that a trip to the dealership can literally change, add or delete a certain feature you're used to, and did not bargain on when you bought the car.
that's what i love about my mazda. it has tech, but the controls are all in the console and analog. if my blindspot monitoring breaks, i don't really give a shit.
there is a massive auto loan bubble in the car industry. it will break soon due to raising interest rates and once it does these car companies are going to suffer
yeah, agree with all the points here, i own an abarth and a polo gti and i've made myself a promise that i will never buy something that isn't performance related
all this is why i lease. yes constant payments true, but with great credit that payment is low and you never have to worry about upkeep or getting out of warranty.
every single thing, should be getting cheaper to make every year, because lets face it, we can produce more and more with one person, we are automating everything!
how can a car that cost £24,000 in 2017 not driven anywhere still at the car dealership now cost £15,000 in 2018 probably 2019 it will be less than half its value.
i mean it involves a lot of initial installation cost in the form of wiring etc. but would the average consumer be willing to do it if a company specialized in it?
i take the brand new car in lease and after 4-5 years u dump it to the dealer and take in the new one, in that 4-5 years u have nothing to worry about fixing shit.
i usually drive with one hand. if you are not able to drive one hand give up cars all together. the only problem with nowadays cars is the absurd price that's all.
in the near future with cars a little bit more advanced than these, there might not even be such thing as a middle class person being able to afford a car anymore.
last week i purchased a volvo v70 -98 glt. got the good engine without electric throttle unit. still. it gots tech, abs computer box. ofc that one has bad solders!
luckily i found a video on youtube that described a simpler way to replace the bulb. also cadillac wanted $9 for the bulb when auto parts stores sell it for $2.50!
my first car was a manual with no aircon and only an am radio. it did just fine and ran for years. all this extra crap on then is just more stuff that breaks down.
oh i know, it is in the older cars that many still prefer. they bring you joy, memories, experiences. fun. and if you break it, its ok. it is affordable to fix it.
only problem with modern cars with me is those overcomplicated, bright in the night, entertainment system. how about make it almost standardized intuitive systems?
the car industry has been dead to me like from 2000. cars after that are full of plastic boxes i cannot fix. and the design is always a god damn ball of some sort.
when you have to take off the entire intake manifold, just to change the four spark plugs on your car. you know its a modern vehicle made to make money on repairs!
yes i understand the first issue. the touchscreen though. if you have one, set it up before you put it in drive. not everyone is a good multitasker and it’s proven
your photo video aids are the highlight of this video. i'm waiting for an in-dash micro-wave-oven. because i can save allot of time cooking while stuck in traffic.
auto manufacturing is heavily regulated, so it's statism that is the problem not capitalism. get the government out of the car industry and you'll get more choices.
because electric vehicles don't really break down so the only thing that needs to be done to them is updating the technology and replacing the brakes. nothing else.
car manufacturers, especially the premium ones, that use slow gpu and cpu for their infotainment should be banned to sell those models until they fix it via recall!
cars have always been expensive compared to the cost of living. if you want the good ol days, buy a horse. at least you can eat it and make glue when it's obsolete.
hey savageeese, what is your thought on buying a vehicle that people can afford. like a person with $40k annual income buying a $25k instead of a $40k or even $60k?
i completely agree, but the way you were fucking with that touch screen made me cringe so bad. wipe your fuckin screen if it dont work, i see 108247615 fingerprints
i even buy my tires used, $50 a tire. but i always make sure they are high quality name brand tires. i got 80,000 miles off my last set of tires, cost me 200 bucks.
i would add visibility to the list. they made car safer but they have gone a bit too far in safety regulations i think and now we can't see out of new cars properly
i've got a 2004 vw gli that i get irritated with sometimes because of its new features. why does it beep at me when i turn the car on and don't have my seatbelt on?
in 1978 i bought my first and only new car, right off the showroom floor. a data in b210 hatchback with 5 speed manual transmission, air conditioning and that's it!
in addition to what you said, it just kills me that our cars can be updated like our cell phones. and how many times does your cell phone not work right afterwards?
most of the work in buying cars should rely on research. if people are not even doing their homework before signing the forms, they should not even be there at all.
my car is a nice balance between new and old which i love, but these modern restricted cars with all these fancy expensive features are less fun and more dangerous!
not a mediocre every other person is driving one car. $350 a month wasn't bad but balancing rent and all the other bills with that on only $2000 a month is a bitch.
they are new cars. that's why people buy old cars, not just because they are cheaper, but because cars around the early 60's to early 80's were reliable and simple!
we're just a few years away from most people not owning a car but signing up for a program where a driverless car will come and pick them up from wherever they are.
when i have to take my 2003 volvo to the mechanic for a headlight that is a problem. the 2005 maxima you must remove a few parts just to change the bulb. ridiculous
and when you really think about it, if you broke a car down in parts it wouldn't come anywhere near the retail price of the car. it'd be only a small fraction of it.
best example of capitalism off topic is the pop company's going over to plastic bottles then blaming the people for littering and not finding a way to clean up right
buy a reliable used car. something that costs less to fix like a domestic, ie cheap parts. then again a honda might break down less but more to fix when it needs it.
come to brazil, 1.0 liter engines, 70-80 hp, death traps if you get in a accident. and they cost 40-50 thousand here usd 15.000 and our minimum wage is 1 4 of the us
i always lease, new car every 3 years is nice. i make good money and haven't even finished college yet, $21 an hour is nothing to sneeze at when you're 21 years old.
i dont like new car. i drive an old 1996 mazda. all i want is the radio and knobs to control it. fuck touch screen its horrible. got no charm and is generic as fuck.
i have a modern car. ppl still buy these things. they're more of an investment than anything else. buy a car today will last you 10+ years. it's really a no brainer.
i have personally seen people pulling up to a red light staring at their phone, knowing the car will stop for them. tech is great the human factor in vehicles is not
if something like my rear sensors fail, i would just ignore it. i'd just reverse park the old fashioned way. quite a lot of tech, if it fails the car is still usable
regarding updates i have the nav system from a 2002 car in my old beemer and can still get updates for it from bmw ebay. it's super simple and still works perfectly.
you gotta remember this is all governments fault, because they determine by stupid laws that cars should have these things, otherwise manufactures can't even sell it
5:05 nearly no infotainment system needs to be touched to interact, you even did not bother to look on your own steering wheel to find the controls of your system?!??
all excellent points especially with the touchscreens. i refuse to buy a vehicle that necessitates the use of a touchscreen without at least a backup mechanical dial.
also nobody needs a rolling smartphone. it’s not allowed to use your phone while driving for a reason. and the auto manufacturers put smartphones built in to the cars
do buyers actually use the brain cells god gave them??. trucks cost 75,000$!. screw that the roof over my head cost 85,000$ buyers need to tell dealers go pound sand!
hmm. this video has a lot of good points. never thought of those. hey just an idea, review a 2017 car which has the least electronics i bet it is pretty hard to find.
i don't understand the issue. if you don't like modern, safe, big and expensive cars buy old, cramped, cheap, rusty, smelly and outdated. market of used cars is huge!
i drive a volvo s70 1998. i’ve had it for seven years. the best car ever built. never breaks down. cheap and accessible spear parts. 124 hp ton. boxy design. love it!
i had to get rid of my 2015 kia forte5 sx because it did not have apple or android auto. there were no updates. it was so slow to connect to bluetooth. what a fiasco!
i have a 06 mkv gti, it's just enough tech for me. i looked at replacing it, but can't stand the tech on the new ones. only car that interests me now is the nd miata.
if i was a car manufacturer i would not have all this fancy tech and instead focus on more simple cars reminiscent of the 90's while still complying with safety laws.
new cars are as disposable as new phones. don't do it. get something old that you can fix yourself. if you can't fix an old car, grow a pair of balls you fucken pansy
or only buy used cars in good shape that dont have excessive usless technology i will buy a new car again when i can find one with manual controls manual windows etc.
people are going to get too used to cars where you don't have to pay attention while you drive and when they have to drive a regular car they're going to kill someone
scott looks like a mechanic. brought my car to volvo years ago the volvo guys come out in white lab coats. like they're fuckin rocket scientists or something. such bs
the biggest problem with modern cars are the tire kickers who think they are owed a free car. go buy a car at the scrap yard and fix it yourself like they do in cuba.
they stopped making proper cars in the early 2000’s far too much technology for a start. kids born today will never actually ‘drive’ a car. glad i had the experience.
we're reaching that point where a toyota and honda are really only affordable for families that own homes. oh yeah, the average cost to own a house in toronto is now.
biggest problems with newer vehicles. they're built for those who don't want to drive or who can't. they're disposable. they're bland and built as a one-size-fits-all.
here in m'sia, new local made suv costs probably myr 60k. in our currency, not converted or anything, so just imagine. haha. the 1.0 budget car cost like myr 22k. haha
i agree totally with these observations. fortunately i have been unable to afford changing my car to a newer model, and still have manual controls and no infotainment!
i bet some day modern cars won't let you open the hood. just like they took the covers off cell phones so people can't replace the battery and throw them away instead.
i'll just drive the car and not fix it. problem solved. it's all superfluous stuff we didn't need 20 years ago if we were even marginally attentive, defensive drivers.
maybe find a proper job that doesn't involve flipping a hamburger. otherwise don't buy out of your means smart guy. there are plenty of cars for people to drive. reply
my '98 maxima is paid for, in great running condition, and rarely breaks down. meanwhile other people i know have gone through 3 cars in 6 years constant car payments.
my car is 26 years old, no electronics or computers and i can fix everything on it myself with regular tools. this should never have changed but it did and the excuse?
simplicity is the best less worries less maintenance fees, the best phone i've ever owned is those old nokia's the ones that have the flashlight their built like tanks
the best way is also not to have a car. live in a city. you can get so much more without owning one because your time is more managable in a city with public transport
the reason why i am keeping my 2000 mustang. easy and cheap to fix. everything now is like a solo cup. looks good and is heavy-duty, but it is still disposable garbage
this is why i own the cheapest car on the market nissan versa base model with manual transmission. that thing is not going to break, because there is nothing to break.
wtf and now it seems people in the 1st world can't even pay for it, but they do it anyway. for the 'driving' experience. i'm laughing my ass off at this video. so sad.
a car should be a car, not a ridiculous fucking entertainment room on wheels for some feminized pompous fuck who complains about turning a key, or not having bluetooth.
drive to the curb so you are not blocking traffic like the guy that hit you who lays help less in the street. kids will admire you for taking such good car of you ride.
europe does this and i think it would help a lot for americans too. it would also help on pollution control, oil, cars being made etc. long list because your commuting.
i bought a brand new car and then decided to start riding my bike to work every day to save a few bucks. i seem to get flat tires quite often. i can't win for looosing.
i have a 1965 silver cloud iii. had it since 1982. no computers, no lights in the roof lining, no dvd player or self closing doors. doesn't break down just keeps going.
i have a 1998 mazda mpv and it's still functioning like new. i don't have any touch screen because i can already tell i don't need it, i have everything i need already.
i'll tell you how i am able to afford the new cars and their repairs, i'm an automotive engineer designing the new cars making that bank to put in that technology. haha
just get a crown vic. very simple. the engine will go too 300k miles and beyond with basic maintenance. you can even find a used transmission or engine for under $1000z
she went to the dealer, and the wanted a hundred and fifty bucks to put in a bulb. my wife went to the auto store, bought bulb, an replaced it in the parking lot. cost?
surely the in built router i’m assuming the car has should be able to receive this when your using the car. everything is just so un necessarily complicated these days!
thank you for bringing up these issues. i strongly agree with your points in this review. we need to realize the hidden scheme of what modernity 'looks' like. good job!
the problem with modern cars is that they all look like a hiundi who looks like a toyota who looks like a mercedes benz who looks like a nissan who looks like a hiundi.
to all the people saying hurr durr get an old car, eventually old car will cease to exist people will have no choice other then to point these high tech pieces of junk.
you realize you can't compare a 2006 too 2016 prices are brand new i bet 2006 prices where fairly simalar when new, dodge also does also send updates every couple years
adding technology is not bad ,the way it is added is what makes things wrong.for example,i like the way bmw added things in the e46 model,because everything was modular.
i drive a 1992 skoda favorit with lpg fitted and don't give a fuck. free parts, easy repairs and maximum reliability, also dirt cheap fuel. no systems, nothing to break.
i'd rather find a great older vehicle and do a total frame off restoration than to buy todays cars. to have a 'new' older car will be about 20k less than todays garbage.
the first world problems. this is a shi talking. think about countries where people are rich just because they can afford 10 years old car and fuel prices are very high.
what i hate most is, buy a car and two years later a better version comes out. sell the old car and get the newer version. two years later a yet newer version comes out.
all the excess electronics, computers and gadgets only serve to cost big bucks when not if they go wrong. build a car like citroen 2 cv, you would have lots of customers.
frankly i think all cars are problematic, we need to rely more on public transportation and walkability, and live in areas that can offer you that so won't have to drive!
fuck all this tech, keep it simple. i get in my car to drive and enjoy, not to try figure out what button to press for what. and lets keep physical knobs and buttons okay
honestly a 27 percent increase in parts cost from 2006 to 2016 isn't much at all. the parts now actually cost less considering the inflation. but i like a frugal mindset.
i agree for the most part. however, most cars don't allow you to interact with the infotainment center while the car is in motion. so the safety issue really isn't there.
i genuinely can't believe people are willing to blow that much money on car,gas,insurance,maintenance, etc. it's completely insane, probably everyone's biggest money pit.
i'm not sure cars are getting more expensive but i'm definitely with you on all the useless technology that doesn't work half as well as simple intuitive knobs and dials.
just found your channel. incredible production value, and i love how lay out your idea's in such a patient and thoughtful manner. subbed of course, keep up the good work!
they need to drop all that shit. i hate new cars. as far as i'm concerned cars peaked at like 1996, my cvpi has just about everything a car actually needs, and its an 08.
all the price-jacking sensor 'safety features' being crammed into every vehicle today are only useful for self-driving cars & cars being driven by poor distracted drivers.
all those electronics in including touch screen is so cheap to produce and easy to install but expensive for the consumers. modern cars are made to drain consumers pocket.
and the bad thing with old cars is that if the previos owner didn't do proper maintenance on it you have costly repairs that could end up costing more that the actual car.
best vehicles i owned in the last 20 years 1993 honda accord manual trans 1996 honda civic manual 1985 iroc z auto 2010 subaru forester manual 1986 chevrolet ck 10 auto v6
buy below or around year 2000 for under $2000. be friends with local mechanic and take personal care of the car. scrap yard parts will last for long time. problems solved.
did alot of parking lot doughnuts. went on many fun journeys. i really think it was my generations beetle,and never paid over $500.00 for one,but have millions in memories
fuck the haters commenting. running hvac thru a screen is going to be an issue down the road. if you don't understand that you missed the point. lot's of good points here.
hah i bought the last year of the first mazda 6. from the look at the touch screen in the video and i even hate my smartphone looks like i'll be keeping it for a long time
honestly if you drive less than 12k miles yr it's probably better to lease. you can get a lot more car for a lot less monthly and you just get a new one every three years.
how about we teach people how to drive properly before handing them a license instead of packing all this bullshit tech into cars to make people even more lazy at driving.
i can assure you, 90% of suv drivers don't ever drive in terrain that suv's were meant for. is it just to have the bigger car than your neighbor, so it satisfies your ego?
i don't get why some people think touchscreens in cars are a good idea. a good example is tesla. i love tesla with all my heart, but the giant touchscreen is just idiotic.
im 20, my first car when was a 1983 toyota celica gts when i was 17.it smelled like gas but it was easy to repair and simple to maintain and it got me where i needed to go
shaving a interior car with no buttons im very sad about it oke its a new tech interior with a screen but when ya sit in volvo s90 or volco xc90 you will miss the buttons.
thats what you get for not considering how dependable a car is most people will just look for features when they buy a new car and they will learn the lesson after 5 years
this is kinda eye opening since personaly i am always ever more demanding with car tech but now im starting to remember that beauty and functionality is in the simplicity.
$20,000.00 is too much for a new car especially since you can not option it the way you want it. take all of your high tech crap and shove it up your ass car manufacturers!
all comes down to people no matter hiw safe the car is if the driver is not putting attention to the road and using the cellphone well it doesn't matter how safe is the car
drive 87 crx si and 88 civic dx supercharged. love them to death and just bought my wife a 2018 q3. its a nice car but i love my rex and civic and drive them to work daily.
get a decent car with service plan and let dealership worry about the problems. also get courtesy car when car has to go for checks. they collect and drop off your car too.
i am currently between vehicles and am hoping to find a simple, older vehicle that won't leave me stranded because some stupid sensor one no older car ever needed goes out!
i feel like this generation of vehicules will quickly be thrown out to the recycle bin as the idea that a single screen controls alot of function in the car is just unsafe!
i like the deeper meaning of this video not just about cars, but how younger people are finding their place in the world today. this also applies to uk financial situation.
i would never buy a car that i couldn't afford to pay for in cash. cost is not the reason that people are in debt. bad financial decisions and unrealistic expectations are.
or you can buy a brand new yaris fit focus that's barebones, usually with a manual option for 15k. or a couple year old used one of the aforementioned models for even less.
thaty why i like tesla. i mean sure, they are somewhat expensive, but at least they are not as vulnerable to repairs as combustion cars and they keep their software updated
the backlight has burned out but you can still touch the screen to make things work. luckily there's built in redundant buttons from most of the functions. i hate new cars.
also seen too much going around on new cars that say they're not any more reliable than my 15 year old car. too many engine defects and stuff like that. what's up with that?
first of all you can still buy a new car that has no touch screen or power windows or ac if that's what you really want. chevy aveo and nissan versa are just a few examples.
give me a v8 stick, no radio, manual seats windows and mirrors, no air bags or traction control or power steering. make it 10 grand new and let america have some balls again
good points. i had similar train of thought when i bought my used 2001 lexus ls430 lasr year with 70,000 miles. no hi tech info ent. no touch screen. just buttons and knobs.
it's a capitalism for you, they promise you technological innovation and economical growth, not a steady ground for you to stand on as a young and unexpirienced human being.
it's called a decent credit rating. try it. go lease a car and the dealer has all of the responsibility, unless your driving is as shitty as your financial planning ability.
still got my 2004 mercury grand marquis. everything is analog even has a cd player. bought it new in 2004 and gives me no problems. in a way i am glad i don't own a new car.
the more tech they pack into a car, the worse it will get. ever hear of those audi drivers who got locked in their new audi under the sydney harbour tunnel a few years back?
this guy is so old fashion. i love new cars simple and i love the new technology. he just can't afford it lol. people usually don't want there car more than 5 years anyways.
to buy a modern car today for me,i'd have to starve my kids,abandon the cat,live in a cardboard box and make more excuses to my lady than after an all-nighter with the lads!
which brought me to your page. i have heard the evil scary music kreep in while listening to these car salesmen. and watching these unbiased video reviews. the tech is crap!
you do not know what the fuck you're even talking about. my father bought me a huracan because i got straight c+'s in community college. it works fine. and the tech braking?
after watching this video, i can honestly relate to my other friends and all the people who stick to older cars, as well as japanese car makes. what have i learned from this?
don't they know they can replace that boring old mirror with a camera lens that puts your real time live image on a 3 by 9 inch 4k display, right where the mirror used to be?
i disagree with you. by me, i could buy the banana for 9 cents pound in the 90's, now 49 cents pound if i am lucky, what is so modern about the banana that costs so much now?
i don't necessarily like modern technology. i just tolerate it but it's starting to really grate my nerves. hell, they don't even give me two physical key holes on the doors!
i hope the dodge hellcat charger isnt gonna be too bad,,,,i really want one. i still cant be be convinced the hellcat is my perfect daily driver and wet dream of a muscle car
i need a family car for my kids' it's not need, it's want. i want one because it's more convenient. but do you really want to spend 40k+ for something that's more convenient?
it takes your eyes off the road to turn on the heat. i let my husband do the heat controls or the radio. if i am driving i have to do everything before i leave if by my self.
mechanical tech improvements are awesome brake power, handling, etc the infotainment shit and digital gauges and safety sensors like blind spot, that make u lazy can suck it.
my dad bought a 2002 honda odyssey back in 2002 brand new. is 2016 i i have the car now. 175k miles on it with some minor repairs every now and then and it just runs so well.
my girlfriend has a honda civic with the stupid touchscreen hvac and volume controls in your video. its the stupidest thing i have ever run. whats so bad about a volume knob?
my least favorite thing with modern cars is the high beltline and decreased visibility. it almost feels even more unsafe when i can barely see the road driving a boat around.
no you don't need to buy the acrua or the infinity as that is what $42k gets you in the higher end market. buy a mazda, honda, toyota. buy a car with less bells and whistles!
people are just going to depend on them and look down on their phones, or the modern car's touchscreen. put the money into actually testing drivers for their license instead.
so true. i'm 30 in grad school. i can't afford a reliable car unless i win the lottery. i may be forced to buy a car in a year and i'm dreading it and i used to be a car nut.
well said. however, i was surprised you didn't talk about how modern transmissions like the cvt take the fun out of the driving experience, a recurring theme in your reviews.
yet another industry being regulated to death. they should roll back regulations to what it was in the 90's. that's when safety and emissions regulations actually made sense.
you can't really get a sporty but still daily driveable car that is just. a car except the miata to some extent but that is to weak why can't we have something like a e30 m3?
all these new cars are trying to be futuristic. theyre doing a shit job at it, it may be outdated but the inside of a 92 prelude amazes me, and seems far ahead of its time imo
cars sold forty years ago took a bigger bite from the family income. sure, they sold for a lot less, but the salaries earned were a lot below what one earns today. technology?
it's telling that the sat nav in my renault clio a small 3-door, fiesta-sized hatchback for those of you in america is vastly superior than that in my friend's jaguar xf. why?
later on in life when the technology can be afforded, then one may want to spring for the fully loaded version. until then discretion in purchasing decisions would be prudent!
modern cars are cheaper than they have ever been, as a proportion of earned income. and they last a lot lot longer. he is only a kid. he isn't old enough to know these things.
my 2005 f-150 does everything i need it to do now with an aftermarket stereo. imagine if manufacturers just kept streamlining production on old models how cheap cars could be.
no. but they start in cold weather, they keep you cool when it's hot out, they don't fall apart in three years and they won't impale you with the steering column if you crash.
technology new cars worst. for example w204 mercedes not even 9 years old or 10 years old the rear axle gets rusty or it won't start because they used cheap materials for esl!
the mentality that you always need a new car, just for a status symbol or whatever. until people figure that out, automakers will happily keep taking your money every 3 years.
the mfgrs esp ford force you into buying complex and slow response electronics in order to get a decent stereo. shouldn't be. simple is a desirable characteristic, even today.
the problem with these new modern cars is mandatorily making drivers lazy. auto this and auto that. dependance of gadgets and screens instead of your own brain, ears and eyes.
the question is, why won't they just include a standard usb port and a place to insert your own device. for years now i have seen this crap going on and i don't understand it!
totally agree with all your comments. if you think the price of cars are high in the states try australia. even though our wages and salaries are higher, it's still a rip off.
treat your car with care and cost won’t be bad in the future i always see people complaining about how trashy their car is and i see that it’s because they treat it like trash
well what the fuck. all of the more traditional electronic components that make an engine go are still available and can be retrofitted. the cars themselves are too expensive?
what's classed as modern car then i have a 03 plate mini cooper and i been told they have there problems i knew they have but i would rather fix little things than big gadgets
buy a toyota yaris just got a front end off e bay from detroit axle 59 dollar free shipping. 10 years oil tires struts & shock 129 dollars. keep buying your b pay out your ass.
complete truth told here. so sad what cars have become. imagine 25 years from now barret jackson having any of these pieces of crap up on the auction block, never gonna happen,
i concur completely. giant junkyards and still can't find that part i need. my buddy's car has 96 buttons to push. that's lots of bottons. better not push the wrong one. yikes!
i love the bit at the end when you're screwing around with the touchscreen. it's clearly hopelessly unresponsive. there's absolutely no chance i'd buy a car with a touchscreen!
the problem is spoiled kids who think that they are entitled to a brand new car with all the upgrades in their early 20s. buy within your means a used car and work your way up.
this is why i've hated new cars since the early 2000's. too much fucking worthless technology driving up the price of a flimsy pos that should easily cost 10,000 less when new.
wait 'till your 45 with health insurance, a house, family, etc. you'll be happy with an '84 chevette and a rusty s-10 😜. i loathe new cars. they are more appliances than cars.
you got these costs wrong info on 3:09 honda civic 2016 price in the image cost $967. and the cost for 2016 honda civic is $1857 like in the image that is 92% increase in cost.
and the comments section, really. i want to turn the metal key to start my car. fuck push buttons. i want analog gauges and not lcd screens distracting me with bullshit. really?
excellent presentation. i sell parts to repair shops, you are totally right. the manufacturers want you to have to take your car to a dealership so they can make alot more money
haha moufuka doesn't want just car he wants to ride in style and show off you fuck there's cheaper cars don't get a 2017 how about an 6-8 thousand dollar car and you'll be good.
if you can afford it, the only regret i see is so many really don't know how to drive. but alas, the driverless car will take us out of the equation. problem solved, eventually.
some people can afford those vehicles, my saying is don't buy a car for more than 6 months pay and don't buy a house for more than 3 years pay. it depends on credit a lot though
that’s why i love my 2006 gti mk v, it’s got the essentials, no new fangled high tech stuff to break, and what has broken, once repaired, won’t break again for a very long time!
the biggest problem for buying a new car is the dealership. it's such a sleazy business and they use 5-10 different dishonest tactics and all the while they treat you like crap!
the biggest rip off is when you get to the new car yard & after being sucked in by the advertised price on media, you arrive and all the desired extras cost you another 5 grand!
there is a thing i don't like on modern car you can't fix anything yourself even replacing a lamp the interior is so full of stuff you can't understand how it is fitted together
they are made so you can't fix it yourself or even do a simple routine maintenance on them. and i don't need to see a navigation screen being displayed every time have to drive.
you could buy it all third party then instal it it’s cheaper & the hoes don’t care. keep it clean & bass you’ll be ight get you a whip from the 90’s parts cheaper, simple fix’s.
you need to buy a low mileage second had car. only rich or old people buy new. remember the minimum wage keeps the ordinary people poor. twenty years ago people were better off.
your point at car manufactures making it possible to search for resturants on their touchscreens so you can crash your car and they can put more safety in it is. very fucked up.
100% agree. i've just bought a ford fiesta with stupid keyless entry and start stop crap. searching for a way to disable this unwanted technology is was brought me to this video.
2010 pilot touring, 150k, regular maintenance and tires, that's it. toyota highlander 2015, 60k, maintenance and tires again, audi q3, 20 k nothing yet. now xc 90 and love it,,,,
as much as i love the new cx9 and xc90 i'm concerned about having to work on those engines so i'm leaning more towards the honda pilot which has a tried-and-true traditional v-6.
i cant even change my own oil or add an aftermarket radio anymore to a new car. i'm reverting to an old buick 2000 park ave. fresh new engine and im good for 20 years of driving.
i dont need that shit, all i need is a body, engine, 4 wheels and a key to start. just imagine the 86 brz with the same functionalities of an ae86, thats every petrolheads dream.
i love my 2006 scion xb manual trans, very basic but built to last 600k miles going strong and very easy to maintain at home no need for a dealer or mechanic to repair it at all.
i removed the infotainment-system in my 2011 skoda superbb, and fitted a jvc 2-din unit without touchscreen and such. and on-screen climatecontroll system is downright dangerous!
in my opinion all tech is good but you can’t go back in the pass or there won’t be any progress and all the new tech in car is really helpful even for old ppl that couldn’t drive
perhaps manufacturers should be held liable for the distracted driving charges people incur while trying to turn the defrost on. i bet it wouldn't take long for things to change.
reasons why i actually considering cars that are considered analog like the sti. or a manual crosstrek. a car with little crap. i don't want to use a touch screen for everything.
the infotainment systems are jokes. i mean they could integrate a modern 8 core processor system like we have on the phones. but no, most systems have an atrocious lag in the ui.
the jeep wrangler is pretty much the only new car that you can work on it yourself. now the software is different story but i think it's the simplest built vehicle that's common.
these two are some of the many reasons why i chose mk7gti over other competitors. everything is still numbs buttons and i don’t use the touch screen whenever i need to remap ecu.
this is why i got my sierra with the basic non-touch screen radio, no bullshit tech, just basic. don't even have a remote to unlock the doors. will last me a good while hopefully
and all the while you're fumbling with and staring at your infotainment system to adjust the heat in the car or whatever 6:50, you just caused a 5 car pile up and lives were lost!
and be sure to factor in the ethanol poop too, i lost mpg %for% when ethanol got added. whether it was 3%e ohio fill-up for a 10%e michigan job. tested w 3 vehicles cross-country.
and that is cheap compared to many rear brake clusters. the only people that benefit from this design are the manufacturers. the consumers get screwed. jane stop this crazy thing!
cars are really shitty today. i have a 2000 alfa romeo 145, costs $1k and it is near perfect. there is top technology in the engine, steering and braking system, no shitty addons.
i could'nt agree more. i drive an 02 chevy s10, it has manual windows and door locks and a very simple stereo system. 175000 miles and ill drive it till it falls apart in the road
i don't understand how to operate these new sort of cars. 3 hours it took me once to figure out how to switch one on. it was only a nissan. the future is electric bicycles anyway.
just try to get consumers to live without their gadgets now that they've tasted the poison apple of what's standard equipment now. especially if the jones's just bought one. what?
no its just how you use it. you can also search for restaurants before you even start the vehicle, its a lot faster than to search on the phone. and for a lot of cars its optional
the dealer service departments want cars that are difficult to work on so they will get more business, less competition from independent mechanics and can charge more for repairs.
the worst thing ever done to cars is the computer engine control system. and now with the electronic touch screen control all functions, car is a major piece of shit. don't buy it
this is not a car problem this is an inflation problem and a reduction in the ratio between wages and inflation. this is the fall of the american economy. buy fucking bitcoin now.
when i was younger, there was no way that anyone in their 20ies or 30ies could buy new cars either. my parents could afford their first new car when they were well in their 40ies!
from my own experience buy a lexus and you don't need to fix it as it will not break down. just keep proper oil change intervals and other consumables like filters spark plugs etc.
he he. you are absolutely right. but have you ever heard the prices in turkey my country, c segment car is app. 100 k turkish lira's tl, where the salaries are 3 ktl month average.
i am a bit on the opposite end when it comes to new car cost. you can buy avery good car for 20k. what you can get for 25k is outright amazing. what you cant get for 25 is leather?
i just moved from a 2004 car which was great, no infotainment bullshit, physical switches and nobs etc. and now i got a new sports car, its pissing me off and i only had it 3 days!
if i wanted to watch a tv i would stay at home instead of spending 40k for a tv set on tires that gets worse mileage than a 10 year old car. then it has to be fixed every 6 months.
im kinda late to this video but damn, that part where you tried to adjust the volume and temperature just made me realize how bad a touch screen is in a car. it just feels annoying
most cars do not need th kind of service this guy is talking about for at least 10 years. so get a clue about the average high price repair costs per vehicle less than 6 years old.
my mint condition mercedes s500 grand edition sits because the keys were lost and they will not make me another one. it's sickening. they say the part a key is no longer available.
our modern society is going for that kind of life, and it's not good. tell me how much a house costs, it's about the same problem as #1. tell me about a lot of things in this life!
these are reasons i love my 1990 miata. power steering and brakes are the only things not completely manual or mechanically operated. oh and i have a son that is a master mechanic.
today's car manufacturers are crying the blues because they are not selling enough cars as compared to suv's and trucks. why can they not make a simple car without all the gadgets?
totally agree. i bought a 14 forester xt premium. it doesn't have acc, or the sensors. it has a basic radio, and a rear camera. i love it. i expect to keep it for a very long time.
what a moron. typical democrat communist thinking. oh no. capitalism solved a problem but created another. and now has the nerve to solve that. this moron should be working for cnn
what an eye opener. thank you very much for your insight. wife and i are about to retire and bought are retirement vehicles so they will be paid for when we retire. now i’m scared.
your car is not a smart phone it is a car. it takes you around, it does that without updates. can everybody maybe lay off that facebook, etc everywhere nonsense and get real again?
all plastic made not to last long i was a tech from the 60's and up some of the old stuff was pretty rugged, things are out of balance except for the rich folks the way i see it ,,,
cars should have a safety risk distraction rating. in the uk it's illegal to use a mobile phone whilst driving, so how come it's legal to have a multi function touchscreen in a car?
dont see why people need to get flashy and the best. i got a 1993 suzuki vitara jlx and a 96' mitsubishi pajero montero only thing in them that is fancy is the digital 2 way radios.
folks call me a redneck or a hillbilly but my 96 f150 will outlast anything you see on the road today and plus my truck looks better than anything you see on the road today as well.
i bought a new acer tablet for $125. the way i see it, cars shoulde come with an area to connect a tablet. you install the car app, and thats what you use. you want faster response?
i hate the concept of a lease. i like to own the things i give my hard earned dollars for. but this video hits the nail on the head. what am i stuck with once the warranty runs out?
i recall an equally connected driving experience, the driver and car working together. now, the car seems integrated with the driver, somewhat parasitically. anyone recall the borg?
i remember the 1990 740 we had, like 1 4 the engine compartment was open space. if there weren't so many idiots who can't drive on the road, i'd totally buy an pre-21st century car!
it seems that cars are made the same every year, but they're advertised as the newest, latest, and greatest. what's the difference between a 2015 honda civic and a 2016 honda civic?
many of car manufacturers disable the touch screen while the car is moving. so i don't see the point to your rant against the lcd screens. updates to the car infotainment system os?
new cars are just as much as a conspiracy as college is. the true problem is loans. anybody can get loans for any amount of money, so the businesses can charge as much as they want.
purchased a 1999 chevrolet tahoe with 150,000 miles on it 10 years ago for $4,500. it's now at 250,000 miles and still runs fine. why on earth do people replace their cars so often?
so unless you have don't do your homework before buying it means every issue has a resolution that either gets the issue fixed or lowers the cost. also a cpo car is never mentioned!
technically speaking, it isn't much different from a 1980s, 90s or early 00s truck. still was $35k with taxes. i put $20k down, signed a 36 month loan, and paid it off in 22 months.
this is why i drive a 94 corolla. cheap to maintain and i can do it myself. no extra computer stuff to mess with. a system breaks it's only that system and nothing else is affected.
yes, the offer you a touch screen to search for a restaurant. doesn't mean you should when you're driving, it's your responsibility. should we ban having a mobile phone in cars too?
you should try living in the uk, we pretty much pay double for everything. even cars made in the uk, landrover are double the cost here. and as for parts, you need to sell a kidney.
anyone with a basic understanding of finance knows that cars are piece of shit of an investment. let me rephrase that. cars are not an investment. at all. i will never buy brand new.
get a motorcycle mate they are cheaper than cars they are faster and you can experience the riding at it's purest form it gives better fuel efficiency the only setback is the weather
get a motorcycle mate they are cheaper than cars they are faster and you can experience the riding at it's purest form it gives better fuel efficiency the only setback is the weather
i could have bought a modern car. i had wll atleast my family the money for it. i decided to buy a 2000 bmw e36 because wanted a car not an oversized entertainment center smartphone.
i fixed my 2500 dollar 98 honda accord. runs great. had it for 7 years. no problems. but i lol at people with modern cars struggling with payments. look at your pockets first people.
if you cut out the amount of time you spent talking about yourself in this extended selfie, it'd only be 3 minutes long. this vid is more click ad bait than informative. thumbs down.
in the 50's, 60's, 70's cars, you could feel the switches and do everything without taking your eyes off the road. big radio knobs, with push buttons. heater controls you could feel.
not only the running costs and the throw away technology, it's also fact that people have hacked into the car system which is tied into the car, which a scary thing for someone to do
raspberry pi 3 40$ 32gb microsd card 12$ 7 inch touchscreen 42$ software 0$ for total of 94$ +- negligible cost of wires and mounts and you have a modern upgradable car media system.
thanks for bringing this to our attention. very important issue to talk about. i think car companies or dealers should cover the cost when these problems arise for at least 10 years.
the biggest problem with today's cars is wifi and bluetooth. anyone with a cell phone scanner can follow your every move. especially the government and the police. 🖕🏻the government
these are exactly the same things i keep telling people while discussing about cars. cellphones weren't good enough that they had to come up with a laptop installed on the dashboard!
they have a prius makes sense one drives into the city every day and a highlander hybrid. i appreciate it. but i'd never own one- i don't think id last as long as their old cars did!
they want you convinced that owning that vehicle is not going to cost you much over its lifetime. you only have to change the oil once a year or whenever halley's comet comes around!
truth be told, you don't really own a new car anymore. the mfg has full control of this vehicle. you are paying for the privilege of operating it for awhile before they shut you off.
under technology, digital steering fly by wire. traditional, mechanical hydraulic steering had so much more feedback. driving had feel. now it's literally the playstation generation.
usa is a paradise for car lover, u guys have no idea what real expensive is, for the same car, in china, you will need to pay twice as much as in usa, due to the god damn stupid tax.
i still drive my 2005 corolla proudly. owned since 2005. greatest thing is no car payment. the only thing i wish i had is more airbags. that's it. i don't want apps in my fucking car.
it's the insurance companies that's forcing these features down your throat so we can achieve self-driving cars. if you don't like where that's going, complain to the insurance lobby.
remember when a knob on the stereo broke, you could just replace the stereo, usually with a much better replacement, for less or the same as just replacing the original, factory unit?
turbo sky is frustrated cause its cold as shit in that garage and all he looks at all day is plastic, metal, oil, and another dude or two. a man needs some tail around to stay upbeat.
well if you don't want modern tech, don't buy a fucking newer car. buy an older car and shut the fuck up. people want it, and are willing to pay for it, so what is your point exactly?
your correct. electronics fail far more than mechanical. today it's 40c. screens don't work and error codes on dash of new buggy. my old 96 gmc not throwing codes about sensor faults.
bought a 2010 citroen c5, had to sell it for peanuts, i didn’t even understand some of the stuff that needed repairing. at great cost of course, wasn’t worth it nice looking car though
dealers are able to upsell people on unnecessary technology features and make a lot of money off this. that touchscreen costs $30 for the car manufacturer. you pay $500 for the option.
i agree with you on the excessive technology, especially the odd proprietary stuff that's very expensive to maintain and repair. but where do you get a figure of $45,000 for a new car?
i just don't like the way modern cars look. back even in the 90s cars had distinctive looks they had character. today everything is just a streamlined aerodynamic angry-looking pebble.
just buy a lada 4x4 it's cheap and very easy to fix. i drive a seat leon, wich was about 26.000€. if i would not have to drive so much on the autobahn, i would've bought a lada myself.
my biggest problem with modern cars is that for some reason they feel the need to do their own head units design. it was so much easier before when most of them used the same standard.
recently i bought a compact black car loaded with features. problem, they all look the same. i've mistakenly gotten into other people's cars in a parking lot by mistake more than once.
the list is endless on how to save. btw what he does not tell you is that the average age of a modern car has increased its life span by years. that is how much better modern cars are!
the worst thing is that they force you to pay higher taxes for old cars because they pollute no car pollutes so i shouldnt pay 2-3 times the price of the car just to get it registered.
while a typical new family car went for around $5,000-$6,000 and an entry level car chevy nova, ford falcon, etc would cost somewhere around the $4,000 mark with a 3 year payment plan!
wow, this must be the most retarded video of the year. if you have trouble paying a new car, then don't buy a new car simple. how retarded can you be to even think about taking a loan?
you raised some fantastic points that i've never thought of. now i've never ever owned a brand new car, i always buy low mileage one to two years old and i save thousands vs brand new.
americans get paid well, i know it is not as good as uk. but much better than a lot of places, with higher price tag, with also people buying more expansive cars. just work, don't rant.
as i was about to comment about old mercs. i saw the comment under, hehe. that's right, buy a 90's diesel w124 benz and will take good care of you. i did it once and i will do it again.
bragging rights with regards to modern cars a fat credit line with the repair shops and slavery to manufacturers who peddle their built in obsolescence straight to your ego's epicenter.
forget the new crap. too complex with thousands more potential component failures that will ultimately leave you totally beholden to the dealers to fix. escpecially out of mfg warranty.
good analysis-i prefer basic cars. and the failure of all these computerized systems means that these cars will be worthless at 7 years old-it will cost many times what he car is worth.
i wonder if the car companies were the ones to push to the public that they needed these gadgets or were the people asking for them. all i need to be happy with a car is a radio and ac.
looking at you tesla | yeah your stupidly complex gullwing doors are impressive but the removable center console food cooler in the aztek kicks their butt in terms of overall usefulness
modern cars are cheaply made, full of electronic crap, too many useless gadgets we don’t need etc i can’t wait to get rid of my fucking plastic box and get something proper from the 80s
once i heard that the 1999 bmw 740i had more technology than a computer of that time, and that is the biggest problem you have today, would you still have a computer from the year 1999?
right on the money. modern cars are just show pieces. a friend of mine bought a mb class, there was a controle knob with 120 functions, he sold it after 8 month's. it was just too much.
you do a very concise job in articulating actual problems with cars and are honest enough to share that your realizations are accurate for many valid reasons. subbed for logical acuity.
a lot of these bs so called safety features are in these cars not because the manufacturer thought it was really needed or wanted but because the u.s. in particular mandates a lot of it.
buy a dodge caravan basic model, they are 20k on average and last pretty long. the problem today is that people buy an image and a label. ohh what if someone looks at me in that caravan?
excellent video and i still own my 2007 and love that it has the double den radio deck so if i want to upgrade i can buy and replace compared to these new ind@$h 10inch never can replace
hey, they sell it because they know that there are enough fools that will keep them selling more junk that people can't afford but to keep up with the jones, idiots will try to buy them!
i fully agree with your standpoint. my cars are 8, 14 and 18 years old and a life and kicking. they are fully paid for and maintained by myself. what's not in there cannot get broke. lol
i gotta give it to the millennials, who aren't buying cars or houses anymore. that's smart. screw all that. wait for the collapse and then buy when shit gets reasonably affordable again.
i totally agree. i just don't think that people would buy a car if it was basic. i would love to see a new version of the suzuki samurai with just the basics, but i bet it wouldn't sell.
i'm not a fan of updates not one bit. if it works, don't fix it. looking at the infotainment systems on the vehicles in your vid look like shit, they seem slow as hell and poorly design.
if you need to take out a small loan to cover a $2,000 repair bill you shouldn't be driving a fucking $40,000 car in the first place. too many deadbeat posers spending above their means.
jeez for the first part buy fricking used dude. i got a 2004 lexus for 3k with 140,000 miles on it and it works and looks like a charm. you don't need to spend 15k for a car at that age.
not all modern cars are bad, though. being smart while taking your car in for a 5000-6000 mile service can be as cheap as maintaining a used car. this is coming from a 2017 golf r owner.
simple, just write a cheque for $42,000. of course that would be easier said than done for most people. but would you like to know a way to automatically increase your disposable income?
the visibility from inside is awful, i can see better even on my rx7 what sits low on the ground. that's why new cars need front and back cameras, because you just cant see without them.
very nice car, a big positive leap over the previous one we had and it was a great car. also shouldn't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. why does a 20 something year old need a 40k car?
we need a revolutionary car brand to start producing bare bones simple cars without tech that are extremely affordable and easy to repair. more revolutionary than the new tech i'd argue.
why ill stick to my stick shift tacoma. 2010 with no power locks, mirrors, windows and barely any electronics. bought it used for $12k and i dont plan on getting rid of it until im dead.
big car guy. 5 years ago i bought a 08 accord coupe v6 fully loaded used for 20k. cost $8500 yr for payment, insurance and gas. wtf. feel like i’ve been duped. 8500 yr just to get around?
hey, pay cash for all your cars. don’t have to deal with interest. also, never buy new unless it’s a tiny portion of your net worth. if you get rid of payments, you can build your wealth.
i agree. i love the look of the new volvo’s but i hate the fact that everything is tied to that slow touchscreen interface which many have said it just dies on you. and why is is so slow?
i have a 93 pickup the only electronic thing on it is the lights cheap and easy to fix simple and works fine and traction control isn't going to save it's a computer it can easily fuck up
i really don't see cost as an issue with modern cars. it's been an issue ever since cars were around, if you want a car immediately off the factory floor, you pay for it. can't afford it?
i think all this extra shit is dumb the only things i would want in my car are a back up camera, and maybe camera's for the sides of my car for backing out of parking spots, and that's it
planned obsolescence guys. oh we will make the car with great stuff and once it goes to shit you will be back to give us more money on another car. or that money will go to your mechanic
the cars these days are appliances and it is not worth spending money to buy an expensive car. all cars manufactured these days should be backed up by at least 10 year-120k mile warranty!
the irony is that 20 years from now we'll still be complaining about the biggest problem with modern day cars., 20 years ago they reported that mobie texting would make people illiterate!
there no standard is the huge issue. hence reason beside price i won't even consider a all electric car for example till manufacturers come up and agree on a standard the hv battery pack.
a manual transmission mitsubishi lancer with 10 year warranty and no technology except for bluetooth. bought a house based on one income, and bought a used suv in cash. and im a millenial.
all a car needs is climate control and a way to play music. gps is cool but having websites is plain stupid. i just have my phone with a vent clip for gps and a cassette adapter for music.
doesn't tesla wirelessly keep updating their cars when there is new stuff they come up with or when the consumers suggest complain about issues with the car. i would get a tesla if i could
even if someday i have the money to buy one of these modern plastic gocarts i'm not going too. i own an 84 no bells no whistles just a truck with a working radio that's my perfect vehicle.
i had an 88 corolla $700 and a 94 camry $1500, both served me very well and though i always did my own repairs even if i had had them repaired by others it would not have been prohibitive.
i hate the technology where there's a button on the door handle and that you have to push it in order to lock the car when you already have the remote system to open and lock the car with.
not to mention the trend toward tiny displacement with turbochargers, direct injection, more transmission speeds than a bicycle, and a bunch of other stuff that'd cost a fortune to repair.
regards the price of vehicles what's more interesting is that i know for a fact that with a lot of manufacturers, the cars for the most part are built by robots. so why is it so expensive?
so freaking true, but the manufacturers know this because once the car gets older tgey want you to buy lesse you a new car every 3-5 years they dont want you driving a 10 + year old car. .
the fine line between genius and idiocy has been bombed with nukes. get a tesla for 100k and sell your organs for a software update. but richdady cumbreath has got one. what a fucking mess
the other side of capitalism don't buy it if you don't like it. there are other options and if enough people agree with your sentiment, the manufacturers will make a car that you will buy.
unlike big government, the car industry never put a gun to your head forcing you to get a nice car, and either did the criminal banks to get your fractional reserve banking note to buy it.
what i hate is the bullshit that gets mandated by law. like backup cameras. that adds cost that some people don't need and probably gets removed from places like the suspension components.
you can get a $18k car that will last a decade and be super cheap to own and operate. car prices adjusted for inflation are lower than they were, despite having better features and safety.
eliminating manual controls for software control via a touchscreen allows them to reduce costs. too bad they don't pass these savings on to the customer. in fact, just the opposite happens.
i can turn a knob to change the station without looking at the radio. but in a modern car i have to look to navigate my way through the radio on a touch screen. sometimes if it ain't broke.
i have a 2016 ford escape se and my particular model has a smaller, non-touch screen and loads of physical buttons for radio, ac, etc, no confusing or laggy interface to mess with. love it.
they are fragile they are too expensive they are too advanced to fix yourself they are made of as cheap materials as possible there is extremely much useless tecnology in them we dont need.
touch screen climate controls are the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen. sure, give drivers yet another distraction, you have to take your eyes off the road to adjust the damn fan speed!
well, here is the refrain you hear all the time buy a toyota or a lexus, they are reliable. those are the only brands that still do reliable and reasonably cheap to maintain over the years.
yer bu hu. if you give 40000 for a car we give about 100000. we can't get a decent car for under 70000 😭 my current car is a suzuki swift 1,2l 90 hk with no extra and it cost me 19000 usd.
you just scratched the surface of the problems with modern cars. real safety is unimportant to car designers. notice how visibility to getting worse is persuit of a car that looks 'pretty'?
auto manufacturers are huffing their own paint. you must work diligently at building solid value into a product. otherwise you'll soon price yourself out of the reach of your core consumers.
cars are like phones now. made to never be taken apart. i fixed and repaired cell phones for a while it's obvious 90% are made to just be replaced. parts are expensive or impossible to find.
doesn't matter it doesn't take a genius to understand we will have a complex societal collapse soon. my suggestion is for all of you to head for the woods of alaska when before that happens.
good points however, i would argue mobile technology do-sent make your life safer it just allows big companies and the government to spy on you more easily and destroy your right to privacy.
i agree with you about the technology point. as for the cost, maybe you should have chosen a better major in college to make more money. majoring in lesbian dance theory won't pay the bills.
i hate how hard it is to work on modern cars. on my moms 2005 volvo s60 i had to shift the fuse box, to reach the bolts, to take out the air intake, just to be able to replace the headlight!
i hate to see people turning over their cars every 3 years every car manufacturer and dealership in the entire world just laughed at you. cars are just like iphones now, planned obsolescence
i just want to be able to buy a 2003 accord n.a. v6 new every 12-14 years. i wonder about cars that power down at a stop and then need to start back up. how much heavier duty is the starter?
my 01 suby forester has no electronics to speak of. its repairs are still expensive for me, someone working for minimum wage. so i've had to learn to be a backyard mechanic out of necessity.
technology if you don't want distraction, get the lower end then, it is cheap by the way. you want an update, just buy a tesla. why the freak will a touch screen goes bad in the first place?
that's why i lease. i don't plan on buying anytime soon. when you lease you never have to pay for repairs and you can change cars in 2 to 3 years and get the latest technology, end of story.
the problem is that everybody wants the newest tech in their vehicles. i thought i was the only person who was scared of the unsafe unfutureproof touch screens in cars nowadays. great video.
totally agree. that is why i drive a 1981 mercedes benz 240d. my other car is 1997 buick park avenue. these are cars that run and run. the mercedes 240d is known to drive over 500,000 miles.
well it has a filler and the fluid can be removed via syringe. better still, if it ever needs a service have it drilled and tapped to take a plug while you're at it. computer decides to die?
at least cars are a lot safer than before. if i had to choose paying more for a safer car then cheeping out and risking myself and anyone else who gets in with me i’ll gladly pay the premium.
because renault get their built-in navigation from tom tom. better updates, better maps, better navigation, and better performance. why not extend that same logic to all infotainment systems?
don't know whether to like or hate your review, because you are right, but it sounds like you have an open bill somewhere and using sh*t every few minutes, is it really necessary to be heard?
it's not the tech, it's that you have go to school to learn how to use your car. most people will pay big bucks not want to, but have to for the modern tech on cars, and never use half of it.
simply, you dont take loans for something else than investing it for something that will give you money back. taking loans for homes, cars, travels are the dumbest things you can possibly do.
the biggest problem with modern cars is that people are not protesting against the technology in autos frenzy. people are accepting it and unknowingly putting themselves and others in danger.
the one i hate like on my bmw 323 2011 step on the gaz pedal the car dont move for 2 sec then it goes wtf my bmw 1998 as soon i touch the pedal it goes modern cars dont thinq just go thats it
the over-technology. yep, i have to agree there. i'd love someone to bring out a car with practically no technology or extras. imagine how much cheaper it should be, and stress-free to drive?
they should have kept computers out of cars and i'm not talking the high tech gadgetry, i'm going all the way back to the brain that they used for emissions and or fuel injection in the 70's.
used cars cost a fraction to buy and to maintain at your trusted mechanic avoiding the expensive servicing that comes packaged with a new car. you need to show off in front of your neighbors?
you make some good points, that's why i only lease cars. yeah i'm always gonna have a car payment, but i won't have to deal with any issues or tech being outdated. for me, i can live with it.
create the problem create the solution. that's what the government does for the huge military. they manufacture enemies. oh, now we need another aircraft carrier. the world is just a huge lie.
i hate to be forced to buy the excess options of the new cars today. abs and such, i like mechanics, not electronics, the market went wrong for me. i buy manuals and most basic that i can now.
i never thought that watching a youtube car review would have all the charm of watching buffalo '66 while drinking nyquil jello shots. you possess the innate charisma of a day-old poached egg.
i'm a mechanic and this video is 100% correct. i have a 2010 honda accord and a 1971 chevy pickup. the honda has just enough technology and the chevy will last as long as gasoline is for sale.
it really sucks. just look how valuable nice, simple vintage cars and other items are now. people hate this shit. and you can't revert back to simplicity on cars, that would be a huge success!
it's called consumerism. society entices us with newer and better stuff, we buy it. we are permanently attached to debt for the rest of our lives. but it drives the economy. as simple as that.
lmao there's tons of mid size suvs for way under 40k you're terribly misinformed. maybe you should get a real job doing hard labor and learn to fix your own vehicle so you can save more money.
problem is people don't set priorities anymore and blow their money even before they've earned it. then something unexpected happens and 'omg we have no money. cars are too fucking expensive!'
the biggest problem is that they're getting rid of cd players and replacing them with bluetooth. like it's cool and all but what about the crap tons of albums that you buy to play in your car?
this is why the most modern vehicle i will ever own is my 2007 crown victoria p71 interceptor. not so technologically sophisticated and expensive a car, and definitely built for the long haul.
all good points. i wish there was still a w124 made with a few tiny upgrades, it would be a car that's really an appliance and not some look-at-our-crazy-design-and-it-has-24-speakers showcase.
cost go and freaking buy an electric car, and don't forget to top-up wash fluid. only that. also, go and live in somewhere else, with good public transportation, so you don't need a car at all.
i agree with you, only problem is. your first car should never be a new car. mainly because you are a new driver and need to really learn how to drive, and truly learn the cost of fixing a car.
i have a 1991 honda civic si and i paid the $2000 for it and it still runs and drives like new even the electric sun roof still works like new. this car is the reason i will never buy a new car
i remember going to car lots and hoping some day to be able to purchase one of those beauties. now, not only are they expensive but basically ugly. are designers actually getting paid for this?
it is a scam by the car manufacturers to keep sucking money out of you. like every other corporation in this country they only think about the bottom line today. they don't care about tomorrow.
my wife wont let me sell our 2008 rav4 cause she sicken by all these touch screen technology. i have to agree with her, since old rav4 cost nothing to maintain and still on original components.
planned obsolescence has been the soundtrack of my entire life. this guy should crack open a bottle of jd and light a jostick. or maybe just continue making fairly lucrative hippy-lefty videos!
remember when you didn't have to worry about someone with a black box i.e modified opener being able to rummage through every car in a given parking lot who used the same chip in their remotes?
something to add to your beef about the technology in todays cars. back in the late-1980's gm installed a bunch of on-board computers in cars such as the buick riviera that today are like pong.
these are not problems, these are moaning about shit. it has been this way all the time. 20-30 years ago you could not afford the brand new car. today is the same shit, so where is the problem?
they are optional. just as picking up your phone while driving is. you can't really blame the car for irresponsible usage. otherwise you'd have to say why does the car let me read a newspaper .
today youngster buy automatics and lose the skill of driving a manual, it is not only about fun but skills such as judging distances, which gear, etc. helps u in alot of ways is not been taught
volvo infotainment is very weak. ill conceived and prone to break. trouble is there is little or no analogue options. jeep shows the way here simple 9 touch screen with lots of manual overides.
what waste of technology just to go to the grocery store. i don't buy anything newer than 1971. you can actually see the engine in one of those things and fix it with a hammer and screw driver.
driver aids are plain dumb. it just makes you dependent on these. if you have a car that takes car of lane centering for you, you can take your eyes off the road and text on your phone. why not?
get rid of all the fancy tech and put one thing in all new cars a system that blocks cell phone usage. there are too many dumb idiots that care more about their cell phone activity than driving.
holy shit the new volvo system in the car at the end of the video was so bad and laggy. hope it was not a final version, because i would rather crash my car into a brick wall then use that crap.
i can't stand how uncomfortable the car seats have been for the past 10+ years. also, agree on the tech in modern cars. 15 yrs ago, my honda cost 20k. now, it's hard to find a new car under 35k.
i would have like to of seen you touch on the fact that since these cars are so integrated nowadays with the infotainment systems, it makes the very viable aftermarket realm completely unusable.
if my car beeps and vibrates and breaks for me or steers for me. then i am not a happy driver. anyway. keep up what you're doing. you are the most honest and unbiased maker of videos. thank you.
lease a cheap honda if money is a problem. get a new one every 3 years. less than $200 a month. no worries about maintenance or upgrading software #2 dont f**ing use yelp while driving, dumb a*!
new cars massive repair bills, lots of electronic problems, lots of complicated features, keeps you safe. old cars low repair bills, little electronic problems, simple features, you make it safe
the cash mitigation systems actually make you less save because of the false sense of security and complacency. your brain is being turned back in to dependant jelly, you may as well be a drone.
this is why i still roll in a 2001 ford focus with 140k. none of these modern, overwrought cars that aren't some crazy supercar or whatever appeal to me, and i want none of debt that comes with.
unless i need a lift, i do a lot of the work on my car myself, you be surprised by how much you can do on a 1982 mb with a 100 dollars worth of metric craftsman tools and an internet connection!
you are correct my friend, if it wasn't for this concept referred to as credit, very few brand new cars would be sold,. why buy new when you can own a whole fleet of used rigs at the same price.
22 and bought a 2018 camry se. it's all about smart money management. of you suck at managing your money it's your problem. i own my car. stop making payments, pay out right and stay out of debt.
i saw the first minute of the vid and my solution is buy cars at auction and educate yourself on how to inspect a car when buying used. i have done this for a while getting good buys then selling
i think the world of cars is so painful because we are living on the bleeding edge between autonomous and self-driven. cost should go down and safety way up when autonomous completely takes over.
i was looking for an 00 05 nissan small truck which no car maker makes anymore but ended up getting an 04 nissan maxima. it was still simple enough to take care of and parts don't cost a fortune!
i would love to buy the new honda civic but the fact that even the ac is only adjustable on the touchscreen is just freakin me out. whats wrong with the good old buttons and switches i miss them!
its called inflation bud. look it up. the reality is growth in income across the poor to middle classes has not kept up with inflation that's why its looks like things are getting more expensive.
modern cars cannot be sold if they are not 90% recyclable. next if span of a car is 10 years. the manufacture have to be able to repair or replacement and part on a car for a minimum of 10 years.
some of us don't need cameras or plenty of mushy polymers. i don't give a fuck if it's ice or electric. why do you think demand for older, what used to be cheap or medium priced cars skyrocketed?
thats why people love 90's japanese cars. easy to fix, and does all the things these new cars do. i bought a new hyundai and it seems like a pretty good balance if you don't buy the tech package.
the average consumer is so dumb that he she doesn't really need the extra techological stuff, but the manufacturers make it standard anyways. half to three-quarters of the stuff i won't even use.
the second part is very relevant, and i agree with you about the danger of entertainment systems & navigation systems where one takes one eyes off the road, how bloody stupid & dangerous is that!
too much garbage that breaks and wires that barley have cooper and wear out fast opening and closing doors that's why your windows and locks don't work and quality of replacement parts very poor.
happily i can't afford a car with touch screen and i don't want it. touch screen brakes and you'll be driving along with fogged windows being too cold or too hot. no way, i want knobs and buttons.
i agree with one point of this video the damned touchscreen. i hate them. especially for hvac controls, i have to take my eyes of the road to operate them. give me some physical buttons knobs ffs.
i think eventually cars will become unaffordable at least for the lower middle class. as the manufacturers have to focus on more fuel efficient regulations and requirements that drive up the cost.
my truck is from 1996 so i don't have to deal with any of that shit. i can't wait for someone to be my passenger and have never seen a actual radio and fewer than 20 buttons it's going to be great
abs, active tractions control, side air bags, nav system. back up camera's. cars are not any safer then 90''s cars. i ve bypassed all that techy stuff i could. by removing fusing and cutting wires!
ah nostalgia. i once had a dodge pick up with a slant 6. i could stand inside the engine bay to work on the motor. forget the fact that driving it was hard work and fatiguing when it was brand new.
an electronic rearview mirror is, to me, the best example of ridiculous, needless tech in a car. the simple tabbed rearview mirror has worked for 60 years, and costs about $20 to replace if needed.
and if they have an app where you can check for restaurants they usually put a new voice feature in there so you can keep your hands on the wheel this video i am not getting any intellect out of it
and till you have at least one million in assets, never buy a new car, and stay away from the ones loaded with all the junk they put into them, it breaks and you have to spend a boat load of money!
i don't get this bitshfest. cars have so much pointless crap because people like it. what, you expect people to actually look where they are going, pay attention to the road, and know how to drive?
i have a 2010 vehicle, it has 3000 moving parts ,all of them performing without fail, the only thing that constantly gives me headaches is the fucking infotainment system which has no moving parts!
i have ford ranger 2013 it had a charging system setup to save fuel a miniscule amount the only draw back continual flat battery. i had them reprogram the ecu and have not had a flat battery since.
i like old cars easy to work on dont cost much to fix it, motor not compact, not crazy bout the plastic and tin look with new cars, i would take a new car tho then trade for old car like 68 mustang
i like the old physical red and blue heat and air dial. how do people put aftermarket radios in anymore with the radios and a.c. controls all connected or may be they don't need aftermarket radios?
i'm happy that our new* 2016 golf gti does not have core functions embedded in to the screen. i hope in the future, core features like heating and sound volume will permanently be physical buttons.
lies im doing fucking great and went to school have a 300 srt8 shiiiit literally go to school for a degree that will get you paid not something you like people goinjg to school for things they love
maybe a cellphone holder. what i did is, i bought a cheap, bendable, windshield mounted phone holder. i frankensteined the sucker bit to fit into the hole and immobilised it with styrofoam. presto!
plastic. plastic. and more plastic. under the hood namely, where there's scorching temps and we all know plastic just loves all that heat generated by cars and even moreso with turbocharged models.
thank you so much for this video. i totally relate. i’m a master mechanic and smog technician myself. i’ve been saying this about cars for a long time now. i cant wait to see what the future holds.
you should be able to download the specs for any your car's physical dials or buttons from the manufacturer, print it at home on your 3d printer and walk out to your car and pop the new control in.
a few years ago i bought a pristine 1999 4runner to use as my beater and utility vehicle. i love the basic but reliable functions of this car and i feel like a pioneer. need to change radio station?
and all of this started way back with the 5mph bumper. guess what a front bumper cost today and how easily it can destroy a paycheck. and the emissions controls why just to look at the chemtrail sky
but again it could be a legal reason why that is, gm is no supportive of their mylink system and that is indeed to me very infuriating. anyways long comment here, did not want to do that but it did.
here's how you afford a car. allow people with money to lease a 40k car. then 2 years later when the car is on the used car lot. buy said 40k cars for a third of the price. i done it and so can you.
the biggest problem are those damn plastic fading headlamp covers. there should be a class action lawsuit to reclaim all the money we have spent to cure the problem. even expensive $$$$$ automobiles
which car brand would you recommend for the least tech and just for new basic car for a college student that is in seek for a new car. call me old school but i think the new tech are just for meeeh.
you are just talking non sense shit, blaming the modern vehicles with some society and economics issues, well, hater gonna hate, please dont drive anymore modern vehicles if you hate them that much.
you can't even get a car without air conditioning, like you used to. i have tried to order one withou the a c, and they refuse to do it. i've never used the a c in my 1997. never. itr has 4 windows.
as for the last part you mentioned the technology. it also drives up the price, like the cheapest car in the world is from india. from what i understand its 3000 dollars and bare bones but looks nice
finally some one else who agrees with me. i work on cars and i do like technology but keep it out of cars. electronics don't last and all this cheap plastic crap has to go. like vw plastic dip stick!
from 12 on i went to school and got jobs and worked myself up to a nice life and a nice car several time at 59 i own my own home, have very little bills and i have a 2017 2ss camaro, so life is good!
i don't need technology to 'help' me drive my fucking car. we're humans -- divine, conscious beings. when will the 'consumers' wake the fuck up and realize that they are more capable than they think?
i love my 04' g35 6mt. runs good, easy to fix, parts are reasonable. still get compliments on it. it gets me where i need to go safely. 200,000mi and going. and on phone im still using the iphone 4s.
technology is often overrated and unnecessary in my opinion. although navigation is genuinely useful on a car, years of reliance means i no longer work out routes or familiarise myself with highways.
this is what i keep telling people. i always prefer physical buttons for things such as ac or anything to do with the lighting system in the car. if they want to put touch screen, keep it music only.
we all need to get more into simple debt free living. people don't realize how crooked the credit creators are. and both sides of politics and private and public sectors have a vested interest in it.
ye new car servicing every year for all of the electronics is crazy or more if it breaks randomly. some of the tech is weird in the new cars i agree. each one like a different android phone built in.
after the video with the 70's f250 i was really mad at you that was the first savagegeese video i had came across i have to say youve redeemed yourself in my book with this one and in a subscriber now
and by design, it seems there is a competition on who’s going to have the most obstructed rear view of all. thickest c d pillars you’ll ever see these days. the old cars were so simple yet functional.
everything still works, the push button start, radio, bluetooth, ac, lights, switches, and best of all. it's not very much to run, and we bought it as a demo model, €21,000 in 2014, now worth €13,500!
i like buying cash cars, driving them into the ground, then crushing them for scrap. it’s hard to find good light trucks now ones without touch screens and bullshit nanny gadgets, real transmissions .
i noticed you whine about capitalism but not a peep about all the ridiculous government regulations which cause automakers to add unnecessary crap emissions, rear view cameras, pedestrian protection .
new cars are safer cleaner and last longer. you forgetting that early cars just rusted away and pissed oil and the engines weren't reliable. if an extra doesn't work you can still drive it everywhere.
that is why i love my old cars. it's simple, basic, mostly tech free like my 94 ford aspire, roomy and can park in compact type parking spaces. would like to add with modern cars. cramped engine bays.
the people who come out on top of this issue with modern cars are those who are wealthy enough to lease them. they're not concerned with what'll break 4 years from now. they'll be on their next lease.
buy a chevy problem fixed. chevys are made of thunder storms, bruce lee movies and big d**ks. chevys run infinity miles 😂😂😂 i got my 2010 chevy impala 210k miles on the odometer. still runs like new
definitely agree with you on some points. that xc90 is going to shit in a few years. however, my 2004 lexus ls430 has touch screen interface, radar cruise and massage seats and works flawlessly. at 13.
greatest evil is replacing buttons with anything that doesn't click or give reasonable tactile feedback. i want to feel the fuckin thing when i'm trying to heat my ass up while flying down the highway.
my 07 mercury grand marquis has all the tech i will ever need. i just replaced the climate control for $300. i wish it had the manual that came in the taxis and cop cars, it would've been even cheaper!
not to mention the new trucks come with stuff i don't even want, 4 doors, all the electronics that i can't stand. you say the problem is the stuff will not work in 5 to 6 years, i say it dont work now!
wtf do you expect man, we are getting more and more advanced, that is life, realize it wasn't that long ago where we had no iphones. what the fuck do you want cars to remain how they were 20 years ago?
yeah, not only in car but also motorcycle like my 2017 suzuki gsx are packed with a lot of electronics like the fi malfunction sensoring that a bit anoyying if something breaks the bike wont even start
30 year old car can be repaired.thanks to the government and manufacturers the new cars will be throw-aways. it's about bad politics, bad environmental laws to much regulations and greedy manufacturers.
a car manufacturer from glorious romania whose vehicles are dirt cheap and have zero electronics or technology, basically a metal box on gears. and as it turns out, bad quality results a bad reputation.
god i will stick to my basic ass 2005 corolla. no power windows locks, etc. next to nothing to go wrong with it. only things that have gone wrong were my own neglect of fixing things when i should have.
i drive 2003 honda accord. having this car for nearly 5 years. i only spend couple of hundred dollars in repairs. soon will change a head light globe and two tyres after driving 70000 kms. love this car
i drive a 2001 golf. already a little too hitech for my taste, but getting my hands on an older car that isn't rattling or rusting appart is a major hazzle.,, cars are in one word over-engineered today.
i just need a radio cd and aircon in my vehicle for comfort convenience. no electric windows, fancy cameras, ball warmers, etc. to keep me happy. it must just take me from a to. b without breaking down.
i work as an engineer i really wanted to get a tesla, i basically starved myself saving up for it. when i bought it i regretted it so much, but i’m slowly doing better and beginning to like my car more.
i’m with you 120% get back to the basics even the cvt transmissions are junk i have a 2015 nissan sentra 46,000 miles on it transmission problems took it back to the dealer under warrantee it cost $3000
my dad's new f150 will interrupt a song to announce that a service is due please schedule an appointment at the ford dealers then 10 seconds later back to the music. only the dealer is able to reset it.
the insurance for it is 10 bucks a month!. you don't need to go into debt to drive around. its people who try to live beyond there means that get into trouble. just so they can look good driving around.
then i ask them how much their car payment is a month and it's almost what i spend on my truck in a year. and then something breaks on their car and the repair cost is more than what i paid for my truck
while i do agree on most of these points, i'd just like to remind you that you used to have a modern car that was free of most of that, and you proceeded to ruin it with mods and then sell it. congrats.
you can keep your bloated techno whale conversation pieces on wheels ill stick to simple tech that works and is easy to repair. not to mention still as safe or safer than most cars on the roads in 2018!
40 years ago this was standard on automotive market. radio, electric windows and automatic transmission were expensive extras. air conditioning then was something from unreal world of filthy rich people.
i love my 09 honda fit as my first car. drive over a year now. no issue. so many chinese here in united states buy luxury car. even not very rich chinese still buy bmw, benz. crazy. they need save money.
i work in the parts industry and people always surprised how much a part is for their vehicle. headlights, electrical components etc. when they do find out how much the part is they go buy a new vehicle.
me, when i see that. i have more and more desire to keep my old cars in working order. it is much cheaper, and in addition i have pleasure to be able to repair them the news, it became almost impossible!
most of the technological parts are in fact, a scam. a really shitty tn touchscreen costs hundreds of dollars in a car, even though you could buy a really good ips monitor for less than a hundred dollars
quote with car hire from just £15 a day, we want to make your holidays in the uk a whole lot more enjoyable to spend quality time with your loved ones., now that makes sense to me. servicing and repairs?
right on target. plus how abt our dearest cad design which enables them to know the breaking point of every single part in the car so they design the car not to last but not to fall apart before warranty
that's why i like 90's jdm because they have some tech but not too much so they are way more simple non power seats no screens they are just better because they are focused on making the driver have fun.
the best option is if you want to drive a brand new car with modern tech, is to lease. usually when you lease, you give back the car when eh warranty ends, so you don't needs to worry about any problems.
they do not want the extended warranties on it, you always get the option of extending warranties. and it's staggering how many people do not wish to pay the 700usd or so to extend it. the way i see it?!
very true. my vehicles are 7 and 11 years old, technologically very primitive, and very reliable. when it comes time to get a new car, i will get a toyota 4runner, because they are still very old school.
you don't get into a serious relationship with a woman until you've achieved your dream job. iow if you want to become a lawyer then you don't get into a serious relationship until your last name is esq.
french car manufacturer renault bought romanian dacia. they make simple and cheap cars under the dacia brand with no more technology than what is mandatory like braking assistance. prices start at 8000 €.
fuck no, on older cars u press a button. now u have to look on the screen and press multiple times on that shit screen that you maybe sometimes dont even see good if the sun shines on it. fucking bullshit
hi, the best car insurance coverage that offer good quality service. i would like to recommend this site #carinsuranceontario #carinsurancebrokersontario #autoinsuranceontario #autoinsurancebrokersontario
i wish i would've kept my old gti, while european, it was cheap and affordable to maintain. for now, i'll have to maintain my vehicle to the best of my abilities and rethink all my future car investments.
i'm of the school of ' if you can't afford it, don't buy it'. the cars, by the way, are a volvo v70, mx5 eunos, miata and an r32 skyline. by the same merit, if you can't afford to fix a car, don't buy it!
it's called greedy, i bought an overrider where now i can close and open my windows on my car with my remote. i paid 9.00 for it chevy wanted 540.00. unions, and the big dogs cause cars to be over priced.
thank you for your videos, they are the only honest ones that take into consideration cost of ownership and diy-ability. that said, what do you think is the lowest cost to own three row suv out currently?
the late 90s to the mid 2000s were the sweet spot in terms of cars as a whole. they have basic features such as navigation, power seats, etc., but they dont shove it down your throat like modern cars too.
the sooner this happens the better its better all round even for the enviroment if you develop a universal parts structure for all vehicles, you can save billions not only in cost but enviromental damage.
try working on a modern car verses an older one and there is more things to tear or pry off a newer vehicle than an older one. the risk of breaking more of these parts because they are plastic is greater.
you know, i totally agree with everything this man is saying. it can certainly be an opinion but i believe alot of people share this opinion. we are fostering a new society where everything is throw away.
hmm, so what used car should i buy under 20k. i've just ride my neighbors car i think it was a civic i just do know what year but damn, i don't need touchscdeen etc. i just a radio or music in infotainment
i bought a 6000 dollar car about 3 years ago with 125,000 miles, it currently has 225,000 miles and is worth 2500 3000. anyone who buys a new car is an idiot, but thank you, i may buy your car in 10 years.
i can't believe how accurate you are. every time i see a car review and i hear turbo and supercharge engines now they have it combined and if that's not enough they throw in electric to make it even worse!
i don't know about the us, but cars have never ever been as cheap in europe than now. also they are way more reliable, don't you remember when an occasional rebuild of the cylinder head was a normal thing?
i got also a volvo s60 t5. wooooooow how i wish i had manual fuel management. a flow through carb with right nozzles due to its turbocharged. now i have all these sensors etc that work well when they work!
i just want to add, that the reason why infotainments have evolved to tablet like screens is so that manufacturers save on installation and production whilst still selling you a premium for these features.
i look forward to the day when people will have had enough of this shit, and they will revolt and start making their own cars, and all the other shit that's designed to fail after a certain amount of time.
i'd love to own a new car one day. too bad my financial situation is not letting me. i drive a 1999 volvo v40 and don't get me wrong, i absolutely love it but there's just something about owning a new car.
it's time for car companies to start lobbying the government to legalize cheaper cars. that way we can get stuff like the tata here in the us, which is much more cost effective 3k. now that's more like it.
lmy indash radio navigation unit broke in my 08 civic si. honda priced a new one for me at 4000. a refurbished one would be 500. i'm normally very montone by phone but i waa jacked up after he told me 4000
because honda does it that way, and the sheep clients are so brainwashed by their marketing oh they have the highest value, longest lasting, most trusted, besterestestest than any other car in the whirrled!
i work for a tire shop, and one of the things i do is backing out and bringing cars in the shop. drivings hundreds of modern cars everyday drives me to say two things the most why do you need all this shit?
low roof meets high skirt and extra wide a-pillars. the roof could curl forward and the rear view mirror is in your los even if you are just a little tall. you cant see anywhere near as much as you used to!
there should be models that give you the basics & nothing more. a strong chassis that doesn't rust, simple motors, simple buttons. not stupidly simple, just basic buttons and engine with hydraulic steering.
your pricing for cars was pretty exaggerated. my parents got a used van for around 7 grand. my mom drove it for 5 years just fine. what 20 year old buys new cars. hell most middle class people buy used cars
100% agree. at least you guys have the touch screens on the right side. try stabbing at the touchscreen with your left index finger at 60mph in countries that drive on the wrong side, it's absolutely stupid.
i also told him that i found the illuminated touch screen annoying and wanted to turn it off. he didn't seem to understand. i explained that ,when driving ,i found it too distracting.he looked puzzled. ford.
i am completely with you on the technology end of things. i don't want to have to replace my car every 3 years because of all the in-built tech. but what other options do we have for reliable transportation?
i have a feeling this guy is a pessimist. i love my ventilated seats and air suspension. i work 60 hours a week and love it and enjoy spending my money even more. it’s the symbol of my hard work and ability.
i own a 2015 hyundai elantra gt. it is the base model without all the fancy electronic doodads. it has been trouble free for two and a half years. just regular maintenance. will keep it for as long as i can.
if people truly couldn't afford car prices cars would be smaller simpler and cheaper. the fact that people manufacturers consistently sell new cars means people can afford them, and think it's a worthy cost.
innovations and safety come at a cost. if you have the disposable income to pay for a luxury car ,you have the money to repair it. there's no need to pay $20 at starbucks for 2 cups of coffee. thats a start.
luckily i found a youtube video that showed how to get at the bulb through the front wheel well. the whole job cost me $5. i asked the dealer about this and he said it was not the approved way to do the job!
no mention of the + 400 hp, +500nm torque. 0-60 and lounch control in everyday street cars on public roads. top speeds of 250 limited when limits are way below. why dont they limit the cars to street limits?
some really smart person out there needs to come up with a megasquirt equivalent for infotainment systems. simple, fairly basic hardware and software that can be customized and adapted to basically anything.
uneducated consumers who don't buy within their means, complain about the prices they cannot afford yet decide to purchase anyway, and then complains on the internet this is what i'm getting from this video.
cost is the reason that my wife and i purchased a new car for both our sons. now they are on their own, but that help was a key factor in keeping them out of debt and giving both of them a head start in life.
i couldn't agree more. it used to be so easy changing from one car to another. the controls were always intuitive. my moms '13 ford focus has my ford tough and it is absolutely terrible. its only 4 years old.
i design electronic products. cost acountants are the problem. they are plain stupid and ignorant. its called getting fucked by the corporation. if your too thick to see it you deserve it. good vid by the way
it goes on and on and on. and that's not even considering that cars are designed to crumple these days, so that a 5mph collision will cost you thousands. if it's in the front end. but if it's hit from behind?
nice things cost money, we have simply got accustomed to lowering that standard for most things in our life because they are good enough. cars keep getting more expensive to produce and demand keeps going up.
they beep, they suggest me to shift, they even fucking steer for me. i want a car to leave me alone and let me do what i think is the right decision. i am not an idiot, so the car should tell me how to drive.
until there's an 'autopilot' switch for the heavy commute & an off button for fun driving, all this tech is utter b.s. i love my cars but at 250,000kms they don't magically fall apart. the world has gone mad.
you buy a rogue and they charge you $1,200 for the navigation system, then you have to pay $150 per year for map updates. bend over at the dealership, and then again every year. i skipped it and use my phone.
car hire, now, what would i like to drive while i'm away for a few days, i'm in the city so a small car, i'm in the country so a small suv would be good. so many choices. 4 people, hire a car between 4 people!
fast forward a few decades to some newer never new vehicles and i can't even work on them. sadly, when some convenience features shit the bed, they take out some important feature, forcing you to get it fixed!
i don't like the technology on modern cars. i've got a 2001 bmw 3 series that i picked up for less than a thousand pounds in mint condition. climate control, electric windows, cd player. what more do you need?
i just sold my old 1993 subaru and it was still running great. so yeah. infotainment systems are a joke. also, i don't think most people pay $40k on cars. you can buy a nice two year old simple,car for $12000.
it actually does away with the nav screen and has actual knobs. it's a bit back to basics, but has an appeal. the big question is that do the new hondas have the build quality of the famed pre-late 90s hondas.
lol. i dont hate tech in a car, i hate non user tech. they purposely make it very hard if not impossible to do simple mechanical jobs without nasa getting involved can you access your ecu and interact with it?
well they have mitsubishi mirage brand new for about $13,000 usd and most of the use one under 30 thousand miles for just $7,000 usd but yeah i agree with this video cars maintenance is ridiculous in this days
for example 2017 honda accord navigation radio to replace from online honda parts discount price the touchscreen panel assembly $668, the guts of the radio unit $1,495. the list is $954 and $2,137 respectively.
hint don't spend $40k on a new car. no reason you have to spend more than about $25k. and my last new car was under $20k. so, i have to call b.s. on the cost. but i agree on the technology, it's out of control.
i buy fleet vehicles. basic stripped down versions of cars that have little options. i drive the wheels off of them and go buy another. never buy anything less than 5 years old. pay cash for whatever you drive.
if you want heat, you pull a handle. if you want air, you wind the window down. it weighs 1050 kilos with a full tank of gas. and it has a power to weight ratio better than a series one aston martin v8 vantage.
not sure why so many thumbs down. i'm a huge car freak but sadly cars have just become debt driven disposable appliances and you'd never see me owning a 2015+ car out of warranty you're just asking for trouble.
problem solved. work on your own car. im looking at the 2011 crown vic, nothing special, abundance of parts, no luxury, and it costs about 4,000 for a great one,. just don't buy a new car and then you are good.
technology craze, it's mostly for surveillance purposes. the corporation wants to know how the product s are working in real-time when you are using your vehicle without you knowing and without your permission.
technology is amazing. i’ve owned 2 new trucks in my life. my 99 f-150 5.4 got 10.9 mpg i remember that number cause i hated filling it with gas my 2016 f-150 2.7 gets 23.8 mpg and has more power than that 5.4.
thanks for that video and for stressing out how expensive it actually is to own a car. i see so many people that drives car i would actually never be able to pay in cash. that why i'm driving a 10 years old car
the safety stuff is due to insurance companies not wanting to pay out and also making all cars into basically an egg shape for maximum aerodynamics which creates shit visibility so you need more safety features
deyyymmmm shameeesss to moder warfare cars. and the 3rd problem with them is the modern cars dsnt even place for taking good feeling shiittt or givving shittt ezzup in there just right now in realtime dammmeitt!
give us 55k for the base model. and yeah i get that they come packed with technology and luxury, but it still sucks because the value will drop like crazy after that first year of driving. buy used cars i guess.
i canceled plans to trade in my wife's 2003 lexus because of this very issue, since it only has 95k miles and is great shape i'd rather put a couple thousand into the suspension than buy her an ipad with wheels.
just lease, the industry is heading towards that direction anyways. people are starting to think of their cars as utilities rather than long-term investments and the market as well as features will reflect that.
tesla is the epitome of this philosophy. the smartphone of cars. designed to be technologically revolutionary, completely transformative. but they will also date themselves and become obsolete much more quickly.
yea, perf fine. if it was a separate tablet, you'd get fined, but when its a part of the car, suddenly its ok. and that's before it starts to malfunction and refuse to take commands or register touches properly.
you don't necessarily need a nice family car that totals to 42 grand, you could get a cheap nissan sentra again not a necessarily nice car but a usable 4 door car other than that this video has some good points.
you're getting a much better vehicle, and more comfortable experience over outdated, unsafe designs, though to be honest buying a 2008-2014 car isn't a bad idea, anything below 2006 is a waste of time and money.
cars were never supposed to have a shit ton of tech in them in the first place but people are so addicted to tech that they want it in everything they have cause people think things with no technology are useless
i don't want a car with a computer screen on my dashboard. i also don't want all of my cars functions linked to that screen. i keep my old car in absolutely mint condition because there are no cars i want to own!
i guess i could say that's a benefit of living in a developing country, since all of the new cars sold around these countries are 5 to 10 years lacking behind 1st world countries in terms of technology and safety
i would never have thought in my wildest dreams that a 2019 pick up truck would surpass the price of my first purchased house 25 years ago 2019 ram limited 1500 is $84k + %13 hst + freight etc, etc $100k. woahj!?
it is true. my 2014 bmw 335ix with 43k miles out of warranty. cost me $1,250 to replace the whole adaptive headlight unit. luckily i made good money. it wasn't bothering me. but luxury cars are not for everybody.
modern cars run 150000-200000 miles with minimal repairs it's actually kind of a miracle. references to the good old days are really truly full of shit. the software update thing is scary and incredibly reckless.
this is why i buy used and i am a do it yourselfer which brings me to the 3rd pet peeve. todays cars are less diy but then there are less diy to begin with. i usually get as old as possible and new if need to be.
what i love about cameras in modern cars is why you do need them. it's because you can't see shit in those. seriously, cars are just designed for looks now, but they are not designed to be practical or enjoyable.
how about a car that lasts, is reliable, isnt stuffed with cameras, power everything, remote everything, touchscreen everything. i am almost proud to have an 'old' car now. paid off for years, and still looks new!
i have a 2017 impreza i got the gold warranty for free oil changes and what not but i do have problems with the car i just don't want to spend money to fix them probably going to be expensive even for a $19000 car
i just bought a new car and a few of the infotainment apps are already dated and will be obsolete in a few years. they need to treat infotainments like a phone with the ability to upgrade some aspects of software.
i own a suzuki carry '93 kei truck and would never get anything else. best vehicle i ever owned. stupidly easy to maintain, cheap to repair. everything is analog in it. aside one push button for differential lock.
i really really really want a nice mid 80s chevette,i loved the 4 i went through,they were small, but felt heavy, were heavy,did well with snow tires and few weights in the back,and go go go through the snow, lol!
i totally agree with this. new cars have too much unnecessary technology such as park assist for example. if you can't parallel park your own car then you should not have a licence to drive it's as simple as that!
i'll never buy a car that's younger than i am and i'm sixty-two. my current driver is a '48 ford pickup with three knobs on the dashboard lights, choke, windshield wiper, and i've been driving it for twelve years.
imagine your were a production manager and your new machine only run 1-2 hours a day or same days not at all. yeah i know you dont make money with driving a car but in fact you still loose money if driving or not!
re updates, this is one of the things i really love about tesla. my model has functionality that it didn't have when i bought the car because it keeps getting updates to add new features and improve existing ones.
sooner or later we will all figure out. cars are not the answer. cars are not the solution to moving people. they pollute, they take up way too much space for the single passengers that drive them 80% of the time.
this can be summed up by two words planned obsolescence. and it works for smart phones, as well as cars now. but unfortunately, a car cost soooo much more than a phone. even the very latest overpriced iphone. why?
this comment section is filled with hypocrites. i'll bet all of the people hating on the touch screens in cars are using iphones and ipads right now. if you love analog shit so much, go back to your rotary phones.
this is why i still drive a 1999 jeep grand cherokee with 186,000 miles on it. i own it free and clear & regularly maintain it. i will never own anything after 2010 for this reason. we are consumers, take a stand!
what kind of retard system is this. dude, i'm buldering down the highway at 85mph. i don't want to navigate through 2342394072394207 different menu's just to turn my ac on. why can't we just have physical buttons?
a screen in the console. now that you already have a screen taking up space, might as well put a bunch of controls and infotainment crap on it. thank the us govt., they made it illegal to make cars without screens.
cars are transportation. buy more 'functions', it's on you to pay for it. no one needs an entertainment 'system' with 7 speakers and enough power to run the sound system in a stadium, or dvd screens for passengers.
i would love to see a return of simplicity in cars. i can’t stand new cars. they have absolutely no personality, they lack an interesting and fun driving experience, and the touch screens are annoying and gimmicky.
if you think 40k is expensive to get all that, come to brazil and see the ~35k cars 1.0 engines 3 cylinders!, with zero electronics, accessories, comfort, safety, etc. some doesn't have even the fucking floor mats!
if you're on a budget you don't fucking buy a new car. hell, just get a 2000s toyota for 4 grand and drive the fuck out of it for 20 more years. what kind of idiot who is barely getting by even considers a new car?
my first cars is a 1986 chevy camaro z28, and i plan on keeping that car for a long time. i don't think i'll ever own anything newer than 1986, or 1990. a lot of the current time cars will be junkers in 5-10 years.
the manufacturers are doing it intentionally because they do not want you to keep your car for too long. they need you to buy new car as frequently as possible. it is the same tactics cell phone manufacturers take.
totally agree and most the new cars now cannot be repaired at home like the older types. as the saying goes if you want to save money or get rich don't buy something that will cost you something to use or maintain.
uhm yeah, they're expensive, so i just only buy used ones. i could never see myself buying a new car tbh why would i if i can get a perfectly cool shooting brake for 8000€ or you know 16000€ if it needs to be fancy
yeah fuck new cars. they aren't built to last. way too much unnecessary tech that's going to be brutal to repair. and this is something we're going to see in the next ten years. i'll keep my jeep and g37 thank you.
i have a 2018 f150 3.5 eb that i've found to have a quite quirky unreliable sync 3 system has a mind of its own about every two days, if i could buy the b&o stereo system with plain jane sync i would in a heartbeat!
over here. even a civic costs $30k, young adults with salary of merely $1k month are rushing to buy them and take 9 years loan for it. some even took 2 years loan just to buy an iphone. all in the name of appearance
peoples arguments are oh you can update old cars the problem with new cars is all of their safety and vehicle is tied through the infotainment. so you would have to probably drop serious coin on a new one in 6 years
sad that nissan has spiraled downward, and infiniti is mostly about sport nowadays. their sedans were not billowy boats in the 90s, btw, and i don’t like feeling every rock, crack and pothole like with today’s rides
sorry dude but the info your reporting about the tech in the car becoming outdated and then a consumer is stuck with it, is false. there are so many new and improved tech that comes out for older cars, all the time.
yeah cause car manufacturers cater to the average person who most likely dislikes driving. keep all the tech and safety crap and give me a analog driving experience with a manual transmission and hand crank windows.
i can look out on the parking lot where i work and honestly can not say, wow, that is a really nice looking car, does anyone still have that lust for a certain car style or is is just the stupid technology they want?
i wish the older cars like from the early 2000s, 1990s, 1980s, 1970s and the 50s and 60s were back and better than ever, with new and plain simple technology, all cars with the same set of technologies. new cars too.
if you are early in 20’s, buy toyota or honda from carvana. something like 2-3 year old less than 40k. miles drive for 6+ years until you make money. they will serve you faithfully over any european or american cars.
let's look at the actual statistics. oh, wow--fatalities per mile driven, per population, per vehicles on the road, are all trending down. either we're getting magically better as drivers, or cars are actually safer.
my car is 50 years old. it originally cost me 1700 dollars. over the last 2 years or so, i've put around 4000 dollars into it, about 800 hours worth of work, and now she runs like a champ. i recommend picking one up.
the main issue i have with contemporary vehicle is the six speed and more transmissions. my common sense tells me, these are not proven yet. i am sure it costs a fortune to replace one too. i'm not ready for one yet.
they don't. it's not a problem. and if something breaks, fix it. get it replaced, just like anything else. if the touchscreen dies, replace it. if the computer breaks, replace it, just like anything else on your car.
totally agree with you. lots of screens, cameras, sensors and other electronic stuff that is completely useless, and the only thing they do is to distract you from driving, which is actually what you should be doing.
well said and explains why i refuse to buy any cars made in the last 10-20 years. not only will these cars be expensive to fix, but long term they will nearly impossible to fix as parts are harder and harder to find.
yeahh. this shittups shamesss in there is these days of our society gose fucktup and time to hase a good 3rd world war for god dayyym et changee. just for god dammmmdd little changess. suddenly and immedietly nowwww!
you can not break what you don't have. if you have enough money to buy a car with so many things, you have enough money to repair it. try to look for something without touch screens, sensors and other useless things.
you sir, make plenty of sense in this age of excessive consumption. i have no appetite to buy another minivan and shell out 45,000 usd. that's why i maintain my 2002 minivan and will drive it till the wheels fall off
i mean, having a new crv ofc, i know its not a car guy car. just an example, it cost you 200-300 dollars per month. its cheap to run. consumption is okay. everyone can afford that. its not that bad at all. crashed it?
i personally would love an 80's mercedes diesel car right now than a modern car. simpler to fix, reliable, sturdy and no tech features. i have all the tech features i need in my cell phone i dont need them in the car.
its not bad enough that i have to give up precious seconds of driving road focus so i can operate this glorified tablet. but now it cant even follow up my quick finger inputs and transitions between the menus’ faster?
ive bump my car. and a small broken front bumper. the garage is charging the insurance a little bit more than 1 10 of the vehicle price for the repair. its mind boggling. a front bumper + small repairs cost that much!
just get a reliable car without the bells and whistles leather seats is essential to me and my smart phone takes car of the rest. gps, weather, radio etc. buy a toyota, honda or a subaru. they will last you for years.
one is better off buying a restored 60's or 70's oldie american car or pick-up for $30k and keeping it 30+ years. i still have my 62 chevy pick-up i bought for $2k in 1980 and am constantly being offered $10k+ for it.
they'll not live long enough to reach this state. customers in future won't ever remember of their old cars up from the 2000s reliability, because they weren't reliable. i miss the old cars from the 70's to late 90's!
turbos only last so long, theres an additional upkeep to maintain the turbos, yeah they might be quick now but in the long run natural aspire engines are better. i love my n a 5.2l v10, screw turbos and superchargers!
you hit it on the nail. i've been a technician for 18 years and saw this develop. what's the point of having a$2000 hvac infotainment system if the car is going to be worth $3000 in 10 years. for example doge journey.
everybody can find something appropriate. personally i always lease cars so i don't deal with maintenance issues, car is under warranty and never had a single mechanical breakdown with any of my cars for last 10 years.
i bought my car brand new 2 years ago and it comes with a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty. so far i've had 0 problems with the car but if anything goes wrong, it gets fixed for free. buying new leaves you stress free.
i have a short answer 2004 honda element. it lacks 90% of the infotainment and nanny state embelishments that have been added to every other car since 2000, and is very easy and inexpensive to maintain because of that.
i just got rid of a bmw. the designers and engineers did a fair job, and it was fun to drive, but the whole car was basically designed to be so expensive to repair that it's cheaper to buy a new one over the long term.
i love my cd and aux cable. lol, the led lights on modern cars, you need to replaced the whole housing $150. all i need is a $1 pack of bulbs and a screwdriver. i usually toss $1000 at my car for maintanance every year
i wish that a small, cheap price, basic technology, real 4x4 with a low range transfer case utility truck or suv was available in canada. i'm sick and tired of high priced, loaded with all that electronics techno junk!
if you can't afford to buy a new parking sensor or another accessory part don't buy it, the car will run without it 4. don't be stupid. use the infotainment system when you are stopped, same rule goes for a cell phone.
in modern car, mostly designed, when you have problem u can't fix it by yourself, you have to see authorized dealer that costly, its look they have secret that consumer not allowed to know, that sucks, capitalism sucks
modern cars are just rolling computers. i would never buy one. my car is an almost 30 year old jetta with manual windows and a cassette stereo. the only hitec stuff added is the 30€ power door lock with remote control.
probably why the touchscreen display is so wonky is because if it worked buttery smooth, people might be more inclined to use it on the road. it works fine, but is slow enough to be used only if necessary when in park.
that's why i'm sticking with my 2011 accord coupe forever, last generation that didn't have the stupid fancy touch screens or the idiotic smart key and push button start. i have reliability and low cost of maintenance.
yup, totally agree with this assessment. manufacturers are more and more imitating the release cycles of modern gadgets like phones and tablets, except that they come with a $40,000 price tag. and yes software updates?
a button or a switch is future proof. anybody can make those or you can fix them. you can't fix an integrated infotainment system. also, who's gonna make expensive vehicle specific replacement systems for every vehicle?
a local pull a part has saved me a lot of money on my diy car repairs and tires. and recently a local shop used to provide parts to save me money on repairs from an accident. it also appears has low prices on new parts.
cars are getting cheaper and has been for a very long time. don't blame cars and car manufacturers for you not being able to afford it. it's the fault of the reckless socialist ponzi scheme that is the national economy.
find cars with physical buttons for essential things like ac, heating, cruise control. anyone buying a car with touch buttons for even basic functions should see the problem. if the screen stops working, you're screwed.
missed out on a point, every modern car i've been in has like, no glass. the belt-line is so high and the windows are so small on these cars that you have to use all the driver assists because you can't see out of them.
my dad always said the 90s was the last decade of good built cars. it's amazing how much things cost in a new car like my friend hit his new ford 150 trial light cost him 1300 bucks for a trail light like what the fuck!
savagegeese, i totally agree with you.but solution is so simple and most of the people on earth know that choose your lifestyle very simple.demanding will never ends. more you facilitate, never give you peace-full life.
thing is. all these hi-tech stuffs were earlier nly limited to the most luxurious vehicles and now gradually the auto manufacturers are getting all these stuffs into more affordable ranges just for the sake of business!
umm. no 20 year old needs a new expensive car. you can find a great 10 year old vehicle for 5k. cars are tools. until you can afford it, don’t buy something you can’t afford. not sure how much i agree with these points.
you hit the nail on the head, when you said it was an appliance. i am 65 years old. back in the 70s i had a car i paid 100 dollars for and ran it a year. no power anything, nor air conditioning, but it started and went.
you leave one with a lot to think about. i like to lease, not own. i just can't imagine the repair bill alone, for the touch screen panel near the driver. god help, all those who have the cute monitors in the back seat.
everything that is in my car is useful. i highly appreciate all the safety features that technology brought forth. i went from a purely mechanical car to an updated 2018-2019 car. i love it. i think it’s all perspective.
i also perform most my own maintenance and repairs, not because i have to, because i don't like getting screwed over by dishonest mechanics. not that all mechanics are dishonest, but the number is in-proportionally high.
it was very, very painful to watch all that tapping on the touchscreen. absolutely terrible idea with a horrible design optical and logical packed into a single touch 50% chance of reaction lcd panel makes my eyes bleed.
it's the easy credit that changes everything. take that out of the equation and see what happens. but hey, the bankers are happy, the automakers are happy, and the customer is happy, at least until the payments come due.
my solution has been to just have 2003 2004 year models. finding mechanics that don't charge a ton of money and are reliable people though is bad bad bad bad bad even with online reviews, you show up and they still suck.
on the other hand, this could be a good thing. more people will realize the value again of older cars and just buy second handed cars instead. better for the environment, and better for the people selling their old cars.
that battery pack that fills the trunk will cost you $11,000 to replace when it won't take a charge anymore. so far lexus au has been gentle with hybrid customers and will do a deal. maybe. inbuilt sat nav in your lexus?
the biggest problem with modern cars is --- they are mostly plastic and electronics and they look like angry insects. little road feel and are boring to drive. difficult even impossible for the average joe to repair too.
there are about 5 million millionaires in the us. yet all these expensive cars are being built and obviously someone certainly can afford not only $40k cars but an obscene number of $100k plus cars as well. i wonder how?
this country world's a joke. you were lied to and manipulated and psy oped from day 1. its never better your always a slave to be farmed. making things better for people is not what the rich elite masonic scum are about.
u can buy a brand new car that fits a family of 5 for fuckin $17,000. i don't understand what ur getting at. how about you wait till you can afford a car you don't need and drive a ten year old used car in the mean time.
who wants an old peugeot diesel with leather interior and a big a c switch that connects to a general motors compressor and turns the car into a mobile fridge while the car throws back 60 mpg and a super smooth ride? ???
almost every piece of technology in modern cars come in as options. if they want it they get it. and yes some repairs are expensive, but to be honest these things rarely go out, especially on a car that is well maintained
and sure, while i love the features and tech, and sensors my newly acquired 2005 mini cooper may have, i pray that god himself will allow me to fix any issues that may ever rise in it. it's no lie people, their expensive!
car culture dominates the area where i live and people often lose their humanity behind the wheel. cars are like robot extensions of our lesser selves. power, speed, vanity, defensiveness, impatience and social isolation.
finally somebody with common sense. happy to hear that i am not only one with this attitude. i have 20 years old car, got it cheap, maintenance costs next to nothing most things i can do myself and serves all my purposes.
forgot to add that all the safety features that reduce your field of view while driving. i can't see shit with short door windows, angled rears, and fat ass a-pillars. can't see to prevent a crash so i can survive a crash
hehe, like i know a guy that crashed the touchscreen in his focus and now can only play a single folder from a single usb stick everything else wouldnt work, because you have no chance of navigating through that system xd
my car has a slightly distracting app to help me find a delicious restaurant. -i'm so frustrated, boo capitalism. meanwhile. in africa, dikente abooteh was stoked that there was only one dead animal in his drinking water.
my first car was 1949 ply. $50 salvage yard refugee. my 3 rd car was a 1965 chrysler 300 l. it actually had steal bumpers. i could fix every thing on but the transmission. and did. you like these flimsy cars you have now?
that's ok. in the near future, few people will own cars and driving will be illegal once autonomous self-driving cars prove there safety. vehicle crashes will be a thing of the past. no more death, destruction, and dui's.
what all the sensors, gizmos and assists really do is numb the driving experience which leads to less attentive drivers. best is to keep the drivers alert and aware by fully immersing the driver in the driving experience.
what this county needs is a way better infrastructure public transportation, so people don't have to go broke buying cars. this country has made it so that everyone needs a car to get around. you don't see this in europe.
why i'm keeping my '94 jeep wrangler as long as possible, relatively cheap parts when i make repairs myself and the only technology is the new stereo. however, it would be nice to have airbags and a seat-belt that locks :
and this is why i drive a 1998 toyota tercel manual. it's cheap, reliable and simple. everything works because there's not much there to break. and who thought it would be a good idea to put a touch screen in a car anyway?
can we talk about how simple diy maintenance is being thrown out the window for the sake of encouraging consumers to take their cars to the dealer for something that should've been simple like changing a light bulb please?
ever since the introduction of surface mount electronics and plastic blow molding, the new products available have become disposable crap that fails. you might as well stop at the local dump on your way home from shopping!
modern cars also have very little space inside of them. i've been in a 2016 rav 4 and the front seating space is tiny. i'm 6 foot 3 and i could barely fit in. it's an suv- it's supposed to have a lot of space inside of it!
most repairs can be done by the owner with cheap set of mechanic tools except for electronic systems. shocks, brakes, exhaust, lights, oil fluid changes, alternators, starters. all nut and bolt stuff. man up and learn how.
you should look for some indian south east asian low end car market. they make super cheap, tough car that last forever. or you could scearch some fleet spec vehicle trim that dont come out with any of those shitty gimmic.
a coworker of mine likes to say that people buying expensive cars are just bragging about who has the biggest debt he owns a golf mk3 wagon bought for about 1000€, while another of my coworkers owns a 5 series bmw for 46k €
buy a base model kia or something that doesn't have lcd or touch anything. just nobs and buttons and 1 small screen that shows what radio station you're listening to and the time. or buy an early 90's chevy, problem solved.
dash board accessories are designed on a computer screen and when translated to reality, the lettering is far too small. gray lettering on black background is no good. hiding the accessories in clever ways is also annoying.
get a list of all of the parts for a car, buy the appropriate tooling to press the body parts and i bet it would be cheaper to buy the car. don’t forget the millions of $ that motor companies spend in r&d to design the car.
in 1967 the inflation adjusted average car was $22.8k. in 2016 it was $25.5k. feel free to compare the quality and safety changes over those 50 years. the idea that a family car must be $40k is too silly to even respond to.
this is beyond planned obsolescence, this is planned incapacitance. by tying the electronic systems together the autos get too expensive to repair once they are second-hand. that has a lot of consequences for future buyers.
this is why i love my 1993 eunos roadster, it is literally just a car, me and the road. no fancy shit to distract me, no so-called safety features that do the opposite of what they're supposed to. modern cars are ridiculous
2003 subaru impreza wrx, 1967 ford ranchero, 1953 studebaker commander. no touch screens in anything unless i bring something with a touch screen into them. that might change with the purchase of a new stereo for the subaru.
cars don't need computers to run. i have a 35 year old porsche that has only 180,000 miles on it and it'll still blow the doors off anything i'll meet at the local stop light 185+ mph full out, and there's no computer in it!
i don't see myself ever buying anything newer than a 2010 tbh. mostly cuz of the infotainment shit. but also cuz id like to be able to do at least some of the maintenance and repair myself. cant trust paid mechanics for shit
if you can't afford a new car, either get a job or buy a used car, but you make no sense at all. modem cars are great. i obviously know a lot more about cars that you do videoboy, but your video is just 100 percent nonsense.
it's all just a fucking scam, capitalism is almost fucking useless cause it's evil scam artists who really pull the levers of capitalism, i guess it's the lesser of evils in the world but nevertheless it's still fucking evil
modern cars are loosing value really fast. 2015 fully loaded escalade costed $100k, now in 2018 you can actually buy that used one at about $50k. men that's a half price bargain. and your getting the same thing as a new one.
sir i liked your video and i like you. you owned up to having crashed because of distraction. my father trained pilots during wwii and he always taught them 'your first and most important job is flying driving that machine!'
this is the reason why i kept my 1997 acura, fuck these car companies. if i have a huge repair it only cost pennies. so over a period of 18 years i only threw at 2000$ in repair cost not including brakes and tires of course.
completely agree. too much unnecessary tech in modern cars. blind spot monitoring no, cars with decent visibility and drivers who know the difference between a rear view mirror and a side view mirror and set them accordingly!
furthermore, you are not being forced to look up for yelp when driving. it is your own decision, just like how everything in life is all about making choices. it's about being a grown up and knowing when to do certain things.
look at the autonomous car-lobby plebs hating this video probably a bunch of tesla fan boys here, too. they are just as naive as the rest of the people who think mass producing progress will make a difference to obsolescence.
me. i drive a 16 year old miata that is still too expensive to fix but luckily it rarely needs repairs. i'd like to get an old volvo 240. no high tech, cheap and easy to work on. reasonable supply of used parts at junk yards.
now, that's a real story. 100% everything still works. all original, okay, the radio doesn't' work, but that's it. of course the thing drives like an aircraft carrier and produces enough no2 to kill of the whole neighborhood.
ok those where useless points, most will understand when you buy a new car expect some expenses coming, but its really on you as a owner to keep your car up to date with whatever it needs. most weird video on here. mainly you
one could probably argue if there wasn’t collusion between government and automakers also known as crony capitalism we would have self driving low maintenance electric cars by now. who killed the electric car back in the 90s.
well i would try to see if i couldn't replace it with something traditional. yake out the screen, pop in a fresh stereo system. might as well replace the stupid shit when it breaks if it is going to be a fortune to fix right?
you are not supposed to use them is such a way. you can program the gps before starting the trip or just stop somewhere and do it. it's like blaming mobile phones for existing instead of drivers using them in a dangerous way.
9 yr old car, three different radios and getting the itch for the jbl legend today if and when it hits the market, can't comprehend being stuck with just the original oem headunit for the life of the car. your video hits home.
i had the head unit go bad after a year. very expensive vehicle. at first the ‘tech guy’ at dealership said that what happened with old cars car less then year old called manufacturer, new head unit installed four weeks later!
it pisses me off people will happily buy a 40k$ car then be shocked when the warranty is expired and it costs 500$ for an independent mechanic to fix it for a day of work and parts and think the poor mechanic is screwing them.
thank god somebody is willing to say the infotainment is bullshit. i prefer having knobs and buttons so i don't have to take my eyes completely off the road and surf around through menus to change the radio or adjust the heat.
thats not how capitalism works, if our society was actually capitalist, and not krony capitalist, then the companies who pull scummy and shitty practices would go out of business for the exact reasons you said. brainwashed lol
there are a lot of things that annoy me about technology in cars, but my top two are that they put the cheapest version of the technology available and then they make it a standard feature so you can't opt out. and guess what?
also because of all the regulation at least in europe, the petrol engines are getting smaller and of course least powerful, and for a vauxhal corsa it is alright because it has 1 tone but astra has 1,5 tones and the same engine
been saying it for some time. the more everything goes under the dash & in the doors, the more you'll spend hundred's & thousand's every time you put your car into the shop. takes more time for the mechanic to find the problem.
biggest problems first all that electronic crap controlling the engine and the interior. second, non repairable construction design. third ritical components purposely designed to fail after warranty to pressure a new purchase.
i hate touch screens for climate control, heated seats etc. but you can't fault them for not updating a media center. you don't need to update software, were you looking for an update to your old tactical knob heating switch???
just think how inexpensive a vehicle could be built if immobilizers, 8 airbags, vehicle stability controls, abs, start stop systems, cylinder on demand systems, etc were not mandatory. we should have a choice, plain and simple.
maybe if the dicks reviewing cars included things like the cost of replacing a front or rear bumper assembly instead of what they think the tail lights look like or how menacing they think the headlamps look it would be better.
modern cars also have the same basic problems rust and brake pipes made out of steel. all cars should be under sealed ,have copper brake pipes and stainless steel exhausts. maybe the more people would keep their cars long term.
simple solution always buy the base model. that way, you can tune, mod, and add all the bells and whistles you like, on your terms. picked up a 2013 optima lx, have it tuned just the way i like, and an having a hugely fun time!
what about mercedes class from 1990. it has memory seats and memory seats in this old mercedes will broke probably. you say that new cars distract you with all the screens and tech. you have voice control so it will help a lot.
and this is why it's fun to hack it. not like in an evil way, but more like control the system. i'm currently building a mobile device with an included feature which allows me to send the same signals as my key to unlock my car.
cars now are too ladened down with too much unnecessary technology. too many computer driven aspects that all break down. it is a trap for the buyer. cars are made to fail in 5-8 years so that you must junk it and buy a new one.
i brokered commercial office space in the 80's in the san francisco bay area in california, and leased office space to this company that was deep into all this shit, as you say. little did i know, but i enjoyed commission check!
i drive a 1993 civic and it runs great. the first and greatest problem is new cars last for this short. and governemts want to ban old reliable cars cos they are not clean enough which is bullcrap. it´s just for economy reasons.
i hate using touch screen in a car, specially in canada, where you usually have heavy gloves on during winter. touch screens on car is just stupid idea. driver interact with physical buttons much better than laggy touch screens.
i think your second point belongs in the 2000´s decade. that´s when the trouble was brewing in the globalized neoliberal car industry. i don´t want to bash the progress of technology based on one bad president and post ideology.
im a loyal honda customer since 98, and i will not buy into the overpriced crap theyre putting on the road. all 2018 vehicles and beyond are to have rear view cameras on them, and for what, cause idiots cant back a vehicle up???
not only that, your car will eventually hit the scarp yard, think about this, you would take a massive loan, spending years paying it back, plus the expensive repair costs, and it wont last a decade until its considered obsolete
oh another issue i just do no understand. is why someone would take a perfectly good working pick up truck then atrocious lee stick big rims on the truck jack the suspension and totally screw up the steering and driving dynamics
somebody else basically said the same thing. push button ignitions is unnecessary and they cost a lot of money to fix if people know it or not. if you loose your key fob you still need a key too. i like buttons and knobs anyway.
technology. you would only need the practical tech that actually helps with safety. that is why there are different trim levels and car models to choose from. why get a bmw with excessive tech if you only need to go from a-to-b?
this is why i probably never will get a brand new car. all this technolgy, i'm crossing fingers and shitting bricks for the fear that the immobilizer in our 20year old volvo dies. imagine a new v90 with all its gubbins. hell no.
what i dislike about modern cars is the looks. i love some of them. but even those don't look that good. i mean they kinda look too. plasticky or something about all the modern shit in them. the golf iv looks better than the vii
you either should wait for the huge rebate and discount don't get fooled by paying msrp or over that. that's what drives the price of cars to go up, the demand. most car buyers only keep their car an average of less than 5 years
be a little bit safer how about fucking paying attention to the road and feel your fucking car ow wait your car is a plastic piece of shit made from a machine controlled by a computer that runs on fucking diesel and its automatic
cars aren't expensive, wages are low, historically low. we used to earn enough to pay the rent or mortgage and 3 4 of our wages would be left over for things like food and cars, but now after paying for our roof only 1 4 is left.
get off the infotainment and drive the fkn car. never had these problems when gas brake and shifter were the main features in a car. i got rear ended by some looking at their 9 inch nav screen. that's why i keep a bare bones dash
its becoming disposable, thats the ultimate truth. where i live ppl sell their cars after 5 after warranty ends. mostly are german and high tech cars. because no one wants to afford fixing an issue that would cost them 5 figures.
modern infotainment systems are the worst. 1500$ extra for a simple lcd screen with the performance of a 10 year old chinese smartphone that cost 20$. but hey at least i cant control anything in the car if that thing ever breaks.
my 1967 mustang gt has a 200ci inline 6, manual windows,manual locks mirrors etc. in 1967 my mustang costed 2k brand new. when my mustangs engine goes bad im not getting the crappy 2018 mustang eco boost for 42k 4cyl engine junk!
really the only assist feature i think would be helpful to have is adaptive cruise control. i often get to drive newer cars with all kinds of tech but when i go back to my 2010 the only thing i wish i had was the adaptive cruise.
take a fairly efficient sedan, jack it into the airflow and a ton of excess flab with huge wheels, brakes and non essential tech. #vehicleobesity more waste of resources, more pollution, more running costs on tyres, brakes, fuel.
this is probably the most sensible and logical synopsis of new cars i've seen heard i wish a manufacturer would include all the safety gear electronic stability control aside ditch the other techie crap and just leave it at that!
what a cry baby. just buy a certified base model and let the first purchaser take the depreciation beating. there are so many car options there's something for everyone. modern cars have all of this stuff because people enjoy it.
you can still buy recent cars with a limited budget. i bought a 2013 vw jetta. the car had 39k km on it and the only fancy things i have are electric windows, heating seats and cruise control. all for 10k cheap maintenance costs.
college costs have gotten out of control. taking inflation into account, the same degree i got back in the 80s now costs over ~3x more than what it cost back then. no wonder why the kids can't afford or don't want to pay for cars.
downgraded to a 1999 miata. i don't want any driving assists. no touch screens. i don't want to use my voice for anything. i don't want it shifting for me. i want to be in complete control. i have a bare bones radio and that's it!
good point, but this whole auto industry is gonna die some day, there are more people coming onto this earth and at the end there will be a big shift in transportation, just look at china, soon the whole world's gonna be like that
how about #3 you can never find a single product that actually does what you want. it's like manufacturers get together and divide up one well designed product and put one part of that design into each one of their competing cars.
in a nut shell, they have become tech heavy with gadgets and heavy. perhaps we could have less tech and make lighter cars and they will become even more fuel efficient with direct injection, hybrids, really good diesels and so on.
life is meaningful through survival and risk to seek connection through commonality. it was only inevitable that technology would replace man's nature. it makes us impotent and hapless, thus justifies further technology assistance
my biggest gripe with modern cars is that i have to depend more and more on others to have it serviced repaired. i feel like i have to go to work in order to pay for the car so that i can then give work to the people repairing it!
problem solved, import from russia one of ladas, i recommend 4x4 or niva, or even chevy niva, or an dutson. pay customs, and you get yourself a brand new car for 15,000, which is simple, the way it used to be, and pretty reliable.
those touchscreen only ac controls are surely bad. nothing like buttons and knobs for that kind of basic function. the thing is that it's cheaper to put a touch screen, so as long as the customers go with it, the car makers do it.
well i have to agree with you the solution is to legislate, bring in laws that compels the manufacturer to maintain these systems life warranties or we say say that basic systems are retained outside the tech. we need to pass laws
when my friends and coworkers have an issue on their new vehicles, they will take it in and then inevitably i hear this. omg!. it was over $1,000 to fix it!, i just smile and think. yup. keep the old girl running as long as i can!
your first point is not really true. you can buy cheap new cars. yes a lot of cars are pricey but we are in an era of super cheap new cars. brand new mirca under 10,000$ cad new. yes we are also in an era of responsibleness credit
i got my toyota matrix 2004 mt 80k mileage for 2500. new tires $600. new break ceramic break $600 which is i installed myself replaced transmission oil $50. new axels $200. total of $4k im on 180k mileage now and no problem at all.
i just dont agree with a majority of this man. lets review. 1 cost then you elaborate that makes no sense. you took your personal situation and turned it as if everyone struggles in it, $15k is a lot for a car as a college student?
i'm 19 with a 2001 vw golf. cost me €1750, which i borrowed from my dad and i'm happy. oem parts are expensive but used parts are in abudance. i have heated seats, climatronic and cruise control. it's just as luxury as a newer car.
it's a frustrating conundrum. and from the modern offerings, all i see is buying basic sports cars. they have the least tech and are a hoot to drive. but if you want practicality, even the modern civics are turning into tech-fests.
its happening now, my mom has a buick enclave she bought in 2012. her gps system has gotten a bit out of date, and when she asked the dealer about it basically they said she shit out of luck. its only a 4 year old car what the fuck
just because it has a leds and and sensor. it's just silly i'm glad i still run older cars my favourite car to date was my first car which was a 89 ford escort paid 1000 for it drove it for 7 years and only put like 900 bucks into!
literally the only thing you need a screen for is your gps if you don’t have a phone which i’m sure you do and the backup camera which is sadly required by may 2018, all the rest of anything on that screen could easily be a button.
things like tire pressure monitoring system tpms its obligatory in eu, you have to buy 4 sensors every 4 years to tell you that you have flat tire. even better is if system stops you from going further if it detects lower pressure.
wtf. if you can't afford to buy a new car with cash don't fucking finance one. i saved for over 2 years to buy a 10 year old car replacing my 28 year old car, complaining about the affordability of a brand new car is fucking stupid
all good until a point. i like my car from 91, i just wish it had modern mpg, and few other things. just not touch screen, or thousands of things that will biip and blink to nanny you, i can be responsible and aware of a lot myself.
but that's the world we live in. car, and every other kind of manufacturer build a ton of needless options, capabilities, menus, services and features that most americans, no matter how young or tech savvy will ever know how to use.
buy a new car, take care of it and sell it to me for 1 10 of the price 5 years later. i'll fix it myself and i'm an accountant. new world, new rules bitches. that being said, the best part of some of the tech is you can turn it off.
cellphone comparison to be honest my cellphone is 11 years old and works fine. never had an update, once got a new battery. does everything i need it to. it is the new stuff that needs an update every week to even run. updateanxiety
i always laughed when car companies said they were going green and cared about the environment. if they really cared about it they would make cars run for a long time so we wouldnt have all these junkyards full of cars that wont run
i always laughed when car companies said they were going green and cared about the environment. if they really cared about it they would make cars run for a long time so we wouldnt have all these junkyards full of cars that wont run
i dont get what this guy is saying like, a 2006 honda civic headlight bulb costs around $20 and a 2016 bulb costs about $100 and thats a led bulb that can last for as long as 15 years so is he talking about the whole headlight unit?
i just want an lcd head unit with just navigation, audio, bluetooth, climate, and settings and none of those distraction inducing built in apps. i like power seats, windows, and locks and memory settings. i am happy with 10 airbags.
i put it away, paycheck by paycheck, over the course of five or six years, not into a savings account, but into an online platform that allows one to invest. yup, that money was put to work growing, versus spending it on a new car .
my wife has been hinting at her intention to trade in her 2003 lexus rx300 which runs perfect and has 95k miles on it for a new $40,000 replacement still to be determined. this morning i made her watch this video, end of discussion.
the touchscreen idea is as bad as cell phone texting while driving. this should be illegal. many sensors are redundant or unnecessary. give me a late 60's early 70's small-block coupe any day. at least i can make the repairs myself.
this is why i salvage the efficient engine and trans from the newer cars and put them in older cars. example i put a 2009 3 valve 5.4l into a 2001 f150. its much cheaper than a new car after i sell off the parts of the wrecked donor
i always wondered how we have amazing technology and amazing phones and such yet when it comes to the infotainment system it looks and works like a trashy phone from 10 years ago even though the car is ridiculously expensive and new.
i'm excited for the elio car. it's great for a commuter and is going to cost under 8000 new with mpg on the highway up to 84. that is if it gets into production, which i hope it does. won't be a replacement for a family sedan though.
no usb, no annoying seat-belt warning chimes when i decide not to wear my seat belt, no center computer laden menus, no rear back up cameras, no change lane warning chimes and still safer than most cars on the road. my dear saab 9-5!
ripped out the factory stereo on my 2015 camaro a week after buying it and replaced it with aftermarket head unit. it was the only thing i didn't like about the car. thankfully the climate control stuff seems to be on its own system.
this is why they should just let us bring in r34s and new rx7s into the us without big brother freaking banning it and crushing them. they are safer than new cars. just ruin the fun of letting me own a dream car. bye moving to japan.
well, somebody's been warned, the cars of today are made of plastic, plastic, plastic, they're a real shit, the engines are made of ever weaker aluminum, all electronic shit when it breaks down, it costs a fortune, a shitty illusion.
buy used. simple. my 1999 jeep still works. my 2006 hyundai still works. i replaced my infotainment center on my 2017 chevy with a kenwood. you are blatantly misleading you viewers with stats on luxury cars istead of entry level cars.
i bought a 2005 pontiac vibe when gm had their “employee pricing for everyone” sale for $13,000. since then i have spent a total of about $2,000 in repairs and general maintenance. the car still runs great and still gets about 37 mpg.
the biggest problem is that, 10+ years into the smartphone era, new cars still don't have built in phone holders. in fact, it seems like some of them go out of their way to make it difficult for you to use a dash-mounted phone cradle.
there are many cheap good cars, used and new. you are living in the usa and you are complaining about not being able to affort a car. you don't like technology by an older car or buy an audi or a bmw they don't have issues with theirs
i bought my 2004 tacoma 4x4 new, and had to special order it with no power options. it's list price was about $23,000. the same tacoma today would cost twice this and good luck getting one with no power options and infotainment system.
i bought my first new car--a compact wagon--in 2000 for $15,900. in today's dollars, that's over $22k, or the same price as a larger vehicle today that is safer, more fuel efficient, and has more comfort. curse you high vehicle prices!
i drive a 92 nissan hardside summer beater, a 93 subaru wagon winter beater, a 75 t500 syzuki bike, a 70's ih lowboy tractor, a 70's ih cub plow, a 80's white lawn tractor and the boss has her 02 suzuki 4wd suv my last vw had 60000okm!
i just learn the spark plugs of my 2008 nissan versa cost $30 each. i asked canadian tires why. they said all import cars require special type of spark plugs. this is the first time i am exposed to the rip off that manufacturers commit
if most americans could only pay cash for things and financing was only for those that didn't need it, we would live in a very different world housing, automobiles, ect, would i spend $1000 on a iphone when i could get an htc for $400?
my solution buy a mint 1997 toyota landcruiser diesel. weights 2.7t, gets 28.2mpg. no computers at all. minimal maintenance. a mate has one with 1.2million on. only cost in 2 years rubber gasket for the power steering reservoir cap $10
thats why we got my wife an 05 lexus instead on the new shit, 14 grand for a lower mileage rx awd, ive done some brake mods and a radiator and its almost at 180k miles, no need to worry. get the good ol day stuff and stop the headache.
the other part of the technology issue that could be costly to people in the future is when if some of these led lights that are part of the headlight assembly start going. you have to buy a whole new assembly instead of a simple bulb.
the real joke is that if one wants to buy a little better car, for example a camaro. it would cost 80 thousand dollars. some even go on a lease with abusive taxes and end up paying double or one car and a half. so guys, you're blessed.
vid says can't see any young men being able to afford modern cars, nekminit it takes me like 2 hrs to drive to work from how congested the roads are coz there are too many modern cars and every one of my under 30 friends all have cars.
are gone. a huge irony is that the basic running gear is better than ever by leaps and bounds. my father's 1949 studebaker was burning oil at 60k miles. now, 200k, 300k miles and no oil burning. and that's not even using synthetic oils!
as long as it's reliable, runs well, safe, and clean for me, old car is just as good as a modern one. cars are just tools for transportation. but i'm not gonna lie if someone gives me a free $50,000 car, i will gladly accept and use it.
exactly hwo i feel and im a mechanic at a dealership. the new 2019 rams one headlight one headlight is over 1000 bucks and you cannot cannot replace the led bulbs in it. this is why i would never buy anything newer than 2005 in my books
hi savagegeese i have to agree with you on this. this is why i would still maybe on the laugh of people here, but still would rather drive my old 1990 yugo or current car that i have 1997 fiat punto than most modern shit produced today.
i hate how so many manufacturers have had this huge push within the last 5 or so years to make their cars more upscale, yeah, its great to want to do better, but what's wrong with keeping to your roots and keeping those cars accessible?
strangely, when i calculate 2006 honda civic i got $967, even if you put $214 for second headlight it is still far from $1364. what did you use to have this sum or i am missing something. the calculation for 2016 car is right though? !?
the biggest problem is they are to complicated ,to much shit and crap you never use. u need to get the user manual out just to find out how to use the heater they need to start to go back to basics. its a car not the starship enterprise
the thing i think about the most in a modern car is the touch screen device inside, how long is that going to work for most modern cars have them and most of the time they control most of the car when that breaks you going to be fucked!
you the televisions, they are now making them to last about 5 years. the problem are cheap power stabilizers, and because of them in about 5 years display goes bad. cost to put in better stabilizers is about 5 cents more per transistor.
about the 06 civic vs the 16 civic grahpic if you adjust 1364 for inflation, it becomes only 11% more expensive. it's a lot yeah but isn't as shocking as 27%. considering the advancement in technology, i don't think it's quite a bad deal
and, i'm probably never going to buy another mercedes or bmw again. seeing as how they design their engines to break down at 100k miles. i hope they lose their market share to. it's too bad because they build some seemingly awesome cars.
exactly my thoughts. why dont they just put a dumb monitor and a basic controller with only screen mirroring in the cars. i would never buy a car, where the entertainment package cost around 5-10000 €. i can get b&w stuff for this money.
how about increasingly thick a-pillars windshield pillars restricting visibility. it's there to protect occupants in severe frontal crashes. but with the pillar's intrusive size driver are more likely get into crashes in the first place.
i bought a e36 325i 80k miles for less than 3 grand, yea if u buy a new car its overpriced, always been like that. and the overall cost of a vehicle today is much less than it was 30 years ago, really not in love with your first argument
my daily driver is a 30yr old truck. at year 26 it needed a new motor and transmission rebuild. cost $3k. did the installation myself. other than the regular maintenance its good for another 15 years at least. best of all, it's paid for.
shit like this is why i drive a 2000 honda civic that i've thoroughly undersealed and buy all the spares i can get my hands on, while i can. i point blank refuse to be sold these technological myriads on wheels. total throwaway horseshit
there was a mistake in calculating it is written 1364 $ but i think it should be much less. it is exactly 967$ and that raises the difference to something like 100% more expensive and not 27% btw. nice and informative report so thank you
college kids can't buy $15k cars. that's for people who have jobs. not everyone can afford a $40k car. i think most people who are working that aren't in the lower tax bracket won't have an issue with a $20k-25k new year old car purchase.
government regulations are making cars more complex too you know. backup cams will soon be mandatory in all cars for example, and you can bet good money that it will only be a few years before autonomous driving aids are mandated as well.
i agree with this, wholeheartedly. i want to drive a car, not a computer. and i don't want all these automated systems to drive the car for me. look what happened to qantas flight 72. computers aren't better drivers or pilots than humans.
i bet you see those who successfully navigate adulthood as morally and ethically corrupt. that you are the only one who sees the slow unfolding of the cormac mccarthy dystopia that's about to hit. do you hear we should take a break a lot?
i hate those infotainment systems, youre right, theyre gonna be antiques by the time the car gets junked too. thankfully i got one of the last civic models with knobs for everything, 2014 civic lx. even it has a ton of electronics though.
i kind of agree with this video, but at the same time, auto shops need to start hiring someone to work strictly on the electronics of a car, because that’s increasingly not going away. i’m sorry but that can’t be the crutch of innovation.
in poor countries the cars like this are even more expansive, and we brazil just buy 10 to 30 years old cars when we are young, and when we can afford something better. we buy a new car that use the tecnology that america had in the 90's.
in the 60s a gallon of gas and a gallon of milk was $0.30 a gallon but are now 10 times that and the same for cars a $3500 car is now $35,000. the problem is that income for the average person hasn't increased 10 fold in that time period.
now when this is said, i agree. i dont need all the gadget and extra crap that they put into cars today. i just want a basic car that are build to last, i rather pay an extra 5000usd for reliability than gadges and touchscreens and such.!
pretty negative outlook, some valid points though. cars don't need software updates like phones do. if there's an inherent issue that the software has to be updated due to performance or safety the manufacturer is obligated to provide it.
problem with modern cars is makers likes to keep servicing and repairs to themselves. consumers have no way to diy fix anything. everything is electronically controlled and such. problem is service centres tend to overcharge things there.
the problem with a touchscreen is, that you have to look at it to press a button, you have no feel like you have with a real button. taking your hand off the steering wheel isn't the problem, its looking at the screen and not at the road.
$4000 for half a new dash. no unbundling. the vvti gizmo on the front of your is six cylinder engine. its lubricated by a tiny oil hole. when you skimp on your oil changes, the gluggy oil blocks the hole and you trash your vvti controller.
and i own a 2017 dodge challenger hellcat. as long as i can afford to maintain and keep the car, then it is fine. i like the classic muscle cars too, but only if they thought about safety standards, like having airbags. i like modern cars.
great points. own an older monte and a newer mercedes. the chevy has been a dream, the benz bought used, now out of extended warranty requires me to wrench a bit to contain costs. cd deck integrated into infotainment pod how stupid, right?
i apply the kiss principle to all aspects of my life, so it's no wonder i can't stand modern cars. i find that cars from the mid to late 1990's and early 2000's are modern enough to be reliable but old enough to avoid being overly complex.
i paid for my brand new vauxhall vxr in cash and i am 24. you can do it if you are lucky to create your own job. i fix microelectronics and i started fixing cars ecus and body computers. lot of easy fixes honestly they are designed to fail
the part of the extra cost i can understand, but blaming technology for distracting you while driving is stupid. this logic of rejecting new technology is anachronistic. touch screens are bad because they distract the driver while driving?
the used car market in 10 years will go to crap because no one will want to buy this junk. like your cell phone analogy. who wants a 10 or 12 year old flip phone with no warranty and could crap out at any moment. and no way to get to work!
there is nothing you can do, cars will continue to advance as time goes on. yes the electronics will become dated more and more quickly, but hey, that is the norm now a days. just like the prices going up. new cars are expensive. buy used.
they are all commy cars amc was the last real company your plastic junk is almost done as electric autonomous vehicles will destroy all freedom you gave your industry and intellectual knowledge to asia remember what lawrence of arabia said
well its american's letting themselves get taken advantage of and turning into sheep. save money and don't let the coorperations fool you. loser talk is what i heard the whole video. if you want a usefull car drive a corolla thats not new.
cars are way more reliable than in the past and the long term cost of ownership is pretty low. the initial cost of entry is very high though. and if you don’t like all the fancy high tech there are plenty of cars that don’t have that stuff.
i can easily afford the technology of today's vehicles and the cost to repair them, however i choose to purchase a vehicle that i can personally maintain and repair in my own garage with simple tools and inexpensive parts. and love driving!
i think there are two other important points, modern cars are much more complex and that mean they are harder to fix by non-specialist mechanics, and since there's much more to break, they break more and when they do hey leave you stranded.
i'd like to see them assemble the base sale model 4 wd or not platform at the factory and trucked to the dealer. no packages are offered by the dealer, only single choices for a custom build keeping a good amount of work at the local level.
one thing that should be illegal in any car, is a touchscreen that allows for keyboard input. make it voice controlled or don't have it at all. at this point it's more dangerous than a cell phone and i see it every single day i ride to work
the biggest threat electronically to cars now is the adoption of lead free solder sodder to you in the usa, its horrid, its brittle, it breaks down and you have to use thermo nuclear temperatures to re solder it. keeps me in business though
touch screens are madness. distraction technology has already led to deaths. in uk using mobile phones whilst driving is banned. a connected infotainment system is effectively the same thing. how has this development been allowed to happen?
you have nailed it with the touch screen obsolescence problem. my appliance car has a touch screen, but none of the cars i love will ever have a touch screen. and yes, i know that means i'll never love a car newer than my 2005 nsx. exactly.
add with software comes bugs --- and some percentage of these will be serious security weaknesses. not only can your can get stolen through them but some idiot can hack your drive by wire car and take control of it while you're at the wheel.
car companies are running out of ideas in mechanical engineering, now everything is front-wheel-drive with 4 cylinders. the best solution to convince people buying new cars without making more cylinders is to put a bigger ipad in the middle.
car manufacturers are #iphone -ing the car. they don't want you to be able to change anything about it. sucks. my #2013 #honda #civic has all the #luxury items i would ever want in a car. i like audi's but the driver's seat alone is like 5k.
i buy used. cars depreciate and are never a good investment. the idea is to reduce the overall cost of ownership. for some people, having a brand new car is essential to their status of appearing wealthy yet they are upside down in car debt.
i drive a mid 90s jeep grand cherokee i bought new for cash and have maintained ever since. i've stopped wanting a new car completely. i hope it lasts longer than i do, and if i want to take a long road-trip, i'll rent one of these new cars.
i think you're absolutely right. and that also creates thousands of useless drivers who don't know even how many cylinders their cars have but they sure know the size of their touchscreens. of course they don't know how the screen works too.
my solution to that is. i drive a 1985 ford f250. just replaced the fuel pump. costed 20 bucks for the part and took me 1 2 hour to install. old mechananical pump under the hood. i can't imagine what that would have costed in a new car truck
preach it, brother. if somebody makes an open source car, i'll get one. mostly i buy 1-2 year old rentals and drive them ten years. i pay cash, never get collision insurance, do most of my own repairs and maintenance. so far i'm waaay ahead.
this is what ive been trying to tell my family before buying my 1st car but they dont realise the touchscreen tech and all that the disadvantage it also bring. yes the safety features are great but i know what you mean about these newer cars
yeah, and if you're a perceived threat to the government, like journalist michael hastings, they can hack your brand new mb, and run you into a tree at full speed. i believe the engine of his car flew out. they can terminate you at any time.
you can use yelp while you're driving. you can also take your hands off the wheel, turn around and have a conversation with your dog in the back seat while you're driving but you'd have to be a complete moron to do either. ban touch-screens?
as a certified automotive technician, i really don't buy anything newer then 2005. mostly because i'm the one that has to work on the damn thing when it breaks. the infotainment system in a newer model bmw cost $11,000 to replace. screw that!
if the manufacturers would offer an option of no infotainment system, i bet it would sell. i read a comment defending car truck manufacturer pricing. the price of vehicles has more than doubled in a little over 10 years. have incomes doubled?
two problems with this video 1. you yourself rear end someone, because there was the absence of collision mitigation system -_- 2. dude, you have a choice not to buy them. there are millions of junk you can pick from for your and your family.
i don't like alot of new cars becuase they are just boring and have no character in them. while some new cars like the gt86 frs brz or mustangs and challengers are pretty nice, alot of new cars like the camry, corolla or kia's are just boring!
it would be so refreshing to see a new car with an old style interior in say fake wood with just regular switches and analog dials. i dont like the idea of owning a used second hand car but i also dont want to buy a new car every couple years.
learn to drive, if you get distracted with a touchscreen you are using it unappropiately, always use your brain and use the technology of your car appropiately and drive safe any car. the problem is not in modern vehocles but in modern drivers
my mom has a 06 with the information radio cd player. it's not touchscreen, but controls the alarm, lock's, light's, and it's travel, outside temp, mpg, oil change. i know it's also a technical fail if fails. plus stuck with the factory radio.
so i bought a base model f150. it has a radio, a line-in jack, and air conditioning. the only thing it didn't have, that i kind of wanted, was power windows but tbh, i don't even use those very much anyway who needs to if you have ac and heat?
the simple solution is to get a used car with a good reputation. you don't need the latest new vehicle, you can survive on older vehicles. it's cheaper and you'll have more money in the long run that can be used later to pay for what you need.
the updates. i hate the way phones just force you into updating and having to re-learn how to use the thing, removing features you like, foisting stuff you don't want onto your phone and not giving the option to roll back. my car won't change?
there is more, dealer maintenance will cause them to loosen stuff to damage it {honda}. big dollar repair. all repair shops are overcharging. buy a vehicle you can maintain. the best i think are older suv's 2000-2005. minimal computer garbage.
this is why something like a versa note or a sentra is not a crazy choice, no touchscreen, no turbo or di, good fuel economy, good interior space and they are less than $20k. if only they had the choice of a manual in other than the base trim.
i bought a 3.0 v6 jaguar x type it is an amazing car, for 1700 dollars with another 1300 i bought another one so i can have parts to replace it with. it has leather, cruise controll aux and bluetooth 4wd. it has everything and it looks so good.
i can surf restaurants, weather, gas stations, change my nav, looking for parking spots, etc while driving. you also can't get in and go. you have to wait for shit to load all the time. i can't imagine this car in a year or two let alone 5 yrs.
if folks saved and paid cash for their cars they would not buy high dollar cars that they can't afford, just saying. i did have a truck with my ford touch screen that constantly had software issues. sold it and purchased one without the screen!
the price is the same. the value of money halves every 15-20 years due to fractional reserve banking read the modern monetary system, $1364 in 2006 translate to $1833 in 2016 assuming a 3% inflation rate this is built into the monetary system .
car travel itself should be obsolete. quit buying new cars. i drive a 2000 corolla. my cell phone is from 2007 a touch screen and slide out full keyboard, allowing me to text faster than all of you ie. technology took a step back in performance.
great video bro, keep it up. i would also add horrible blind spots. modern cars have much worse blind spots than older vehicles. also, higher dashes, doors, etc. you can barely see out. perhaps they are ingraining a desire for self-driving cars?
i agree on the technology part. my first car. well was a 1963 ford falcon. that car even if it was not a cool car had no computer in it. it ran fine minus the computer and all the pointless things added to automobiles in the past since the 70's.
i could not agree more to literally every single point you made on this video. plus, increasingly modular platforms in modern car design now makes it even harder to fix anything on your own, even with a decent collection of tools in your garage.
i guess it's the russians fault. they did this to ruin the u.s. i already had my bad experience not noticing the turned off headlights because the stupid lcd was blinding me. it was a rented ford with the worst screen i ever saw in a modern car.
i think the tech currently in cars is just in preparation of autonomous driving. the issues of touchscreens and apps will make sense once we are all just passengers and the safety systems, once more developed, will allow the car to drive itself.
its called intrinsic adolescence for there is no money in creating items that are meant to last for ever and not become obselete. i think we all just need to be content with what little we have we all just need to get off this consumerism train.
lol i got a 2005 civic i bought used for 1000$. had it for 2 years, still running crisp and sharp. hadn't had a single issue, it has no features whatsoever. wind up window. all it has is air conditioning lol, it has no cruise control or nothing.
might be a good idea to make a video on the 5 or 10 least technologically enhanced vehicles on sale today. you know, the ones that force you to become a good, conscientious driver and not rely on a machine to tell you it is safe to do something.
that exactly what my dad used to say. the more crap they put into a car the more you will have to maintain. and repair. that's why i always like all manual in my cars. right down to the transmission. the only thing i want power, is power breaks.
the manufacturers don't care about their products after the 3rd or 5th year they want you to buy a new one. that's why they are not committed to making sure it will last 10yrs for the consumer. if they did how will that help their profit margins
i bought a 2 year old car in 2008 and i'm still running with it. i have enough money to buy a new car, but it never seems worth it compared to other things. the ac stopped working well, i could probably fix it but it barely gets cold here anyway.
i love the looks of modern sports cars, but hate the features. even my 2017 camaro is sketchy af due to the integrated infotainment system. we need clean cut modern cars with nice physical buttons. take notice on the new audi r8's climate system.
i'm pretty sure you can fit an average 2 kid family in a mini for crying out loud, or idk, something like a dacia sandero, which is only $8k. new. and do you not notice that all these touch screens, cameras, sensors, etc. are all optional extras?
it's beyond stupid. my car is 2007. it has 4 buttons on the steering wheel cruise control, the equivalent car today has 15. i've read that car manufacturers put all these lcds and extra functions on the cars because consumers demand them. really?
they put the app and touchscreen technology there for your convenience, when it's safe to use it. it's called using common sense and basic judgement. if you can't handle that, you don't deserve to be behind the wheel of a 3,000lb+ chunk of metal.
this is why i bought a three year old base model gti cpo. no touch screen, no gps, no steering wheel controls, and a manual transmission. i drove for thirty years without all that shit, and i'm perfectly happy driving another 30 years without it.
you can literally find any part on any car for much cheaper on the internet, stop trying to scare people, do what you love and enjoy life you don't want to be that guy thinking about every detail nothing is forever, this is why people lease cars.
i agree, but i'm biased as i hate most modern cars and prefer classics 200% pre 1985 classics, all american no toyoyoyoytoo classics are dangerous lets be real, they survived, we can too but most hold their value, if not gain value. +1 subscriber.
i usually leave my radio on so the next time i drive it, the radio will come on but stay locked & blacked out so, it stays blacked out but works, until it's swiped & unlocked then, it's just as dangerous thow, the heating & a c are not integrated!
i'm 63 and i agree that new cars are one big pain in the ass. too much to buy. too much to maintain. money, money, money. and you will never get your money back. all the toys they add will sooner or later fail. i've seen sensors cost $300 or more.
in 2015, i bought a new f150 but i also test drove fusions, impalas, cruzes, focus etc. honestly, the high tech features were nice. the heated seats and touchscreens were nice to have, but all i could think about was what would happen if it broke?
one point i'd like to make while driverless cars would probably increase the number of cars on the road, they would likely reduce traffic due to fewer accidents and not having to deal with people who drive recklessly and cause phantom traffic jams
proud owner of a 90's vw. the car is pure metal and engine. it has a nice and simple leather interior. no digital stuff whatsoever. repairs are just the regular things it requires to do its job of running. it will still be in use decades from now.
same story, different era. it's ironic how everyone wants a bigger paycheck, shorter hours, 100% health care, paid vacations, paid maternity leave for both parents, free day care, matching 401's, earily retirement, etc. etc. etc. and cheap prices.
the only option i didn't get on my car 6-speed 2016 gti autobahn performance package was the driver assistance package with all the sensors and auto breaking and shit, and i'm really happy i did. i don't need all that shit to break and beep at me.
this is interesting. this is why i purchased my frs, and with a standard radio. i wanted as old school as possible but i still got blue tooth for my phone, which is huge. and my phone is better gps than that in cars. and it is constantly upgraded.
i absolutely agree and love that you made this video. that's why i drive a 1988 mustang and have had it for 15 years and it easy to maintain and cheap too. i laugh as i pass people in their expensive cars knowing they are living beyond their means.
i've never owned a new car and six years ago at the age of 34 i retired. i've also never paid more than $80 for a smart phone. by the way i retired to costa rica. you don't have to become what you're schooled to be and that's a consumer. god bless.
most modern cars you do not feel the pleasure of driving. you dont feel the road surface on your ass and hands. also, 1.0 litre litre turbo vehicles with lots of complex, yet fragile equipment makes me want to cry. where is the pleasure of driving?
on the mazda cx5 you can't use the touchscreen while it's in gear. the maps are updateable and a software upgrade now allows android and apple. keep in mind your cell phone you use 10-15 hours a day. you car's tech is used maybe 2 hours on average.
point number 2 is why i opted not to go for sync 3 on my f150 and stayed on the low end xl model. the higher trim trucks are cool as hell, but my first car was an 89 lincoln mark 7, and i know damn well that this technology isn’t going to age well.
thank you mr goose for another great video,i have been complaining about the infotainment controls for years.how is it that it’s illegal here in ny to talk or text on the cell phone but,legal to look down and operate your touchscreen while driving?
the large gas car manufacturers are not your friends. they are mean and condescending like a colonial army of the us establishment. get an electric car from the newcomer. when your local dealer and insurance company offer a discount, send them off.
while i think touchscreens are the future, they just need to be super dependable, upgradable, and with no lag. and the design needs to be very simple. i don't think the current interfaces including apple's solve this problem. too many distractions.
you are just amaizing,i was wondering why i cant afford a brand new car and why i am still with my dads old audi a2. by the time i saw this video every single thought of buying a brand new tech car just flew away.you are so right mate,you saved me.
1990 cars were safest. if you as a driver didnt pay attention you got wrapped into a sodacan. was it wet you drove cautious because youd get aquaplanning, not gonna argue, but all the technology just made the car more dangarous for everyone. period.
everyone is in charge of their own financial well-being. if you want to be slave to money and a sucker to the system, i feel very sorry for you. if you are an intelligent enough person and want some financial freedom, wake up if you haven't already.
i just bought a 2015 volkswagen golf tdi. i got a 7 year 100k bumper to bumper warranty. when its over i'll sell it. the liability of expensive repairs doesn't have to belong to the consumer. i'm in my early 20's and my car payment is quite low too.
oh dear no one likes a full fledged whiner. stop moaning and go and buy what you want and try and look on the bright side of life. i have had two cars lasting 12 plus years and i just got used to them and did not wish they were different or cheaper.
on the flipside, if you have money all of this is just good fun.getting a new car every 3 years, new tech, new gimmicks, insane performance relative to displacement. also, when has the united states or the automotive industry ever been non-wasteful?
the bad quality of them i can understand all this consumerism s*t but this is just too far. you buy a 60k vehicle and it'll break so many times that you will finally give up and buy something new but very cheap so that you won't care when it breaks.
they devalue the minute you drive it off the lot. most people don't know how to do basic repairs on any car. i drive one of the most basic cars of all time. it's just for transportation not entertainment. i work on my own car and take pride in that.
touch screens in cars are indeed incredibly stupid. i'm glad i'm not the only one who noticed that people don't look at the fucking road, and that the failure of this one single part means you lose 80% of the functionality of the car on some models.
well, on the bright side, teslas take care of pretty much all of your issues. the only thing you mention that apply to teslas is that they have touchscreens, but touchscreens don't actually wear out. the rest of your vehicle will die before it does.
you can just buy a 90's japanese car for lees than 2k like a 1990 mazda miata mx-5 or toyotas have a great reputation for last like 20 years or more and cost less. best way take of servicing is doing it yourself, in our age we hav ppl like chrisfix.
backup camera, backup sensors, bluetooth, usb, led, touchscreens, keyless entry. they keep wanting more and more and manufacturers have an excuse to max the price on stupid simple parts. not only cars but basically on everything you can buy nowadays.
give me an old 90 is merc any day. than have any of these new plastic cans ,now i am getting on, and not a boy racer anymore i would have a c or e class 2.5 ltr 5 cyl diesel they go on for ever, if looked after. a 190 e is a good engineered car also.
i remember once i was using my cousins suv to send their kids to school during winter and that suv has modern technology. it took me forever to find the climate controls within the menu. i'm used to just turn knobs and switches in less than a second.
i'm a tech savvy i bought a vw golf gti autobahn it took me 3 months to get what i want now i love my car i can fix my car, learn to fix on youtube so you don't have spend money just spend on parts i have 3 jobs for my rent and paying for my car hey!
thing is it’s jus going to get worse manufacturers jus going to keep putting in stuff time after time especially when they keep saying cars going to drive themselves i don’t need my car to drive itself what is the point, that one makes no sense to me
totally makes sense and i can see your point. consumers have been brainwashed into believing that they need and have to have this stuff in their lives. some of this tech also mitigates some of the basic driving skills that every motorist should have.
you don't understand capitalism. capitalism doesn't stop a low-tech car from being manufactured and sold. only two things get in the way 1. government regulations, especially those related to health and safety. this has nothing to do with capitalism.
i hate the fact that i have to actually have to get involved the screen and take my eyes off the road just to turn the heat down. i just want t fucking knob to turn. same the radio. they do it to keep up the other car makers. americans love bull shit.
i have a 1999 mitsubishi mirage ce hatch, which i find so easy to drive, reliable, good insurance, excellent in traffic. has 253,000km's on clock and apart from general maintenance, oil, topping up radiator and tyre pressures i never have any problem.
i ride a bicycle,do i need to upgrade,just saying.have a great day with your $800.00 dollar car payments,super mortgages, gold digging wives or husbands and children. i am a mgtow men going there own way, it is really satisfying in today's shit world!
people need to remember that the manufacturers only want their vehicle to last until the warranty period. if the vehicle outlasts the warranty period, then the engineers messed up using lasting and expensive materials and over engineering the vehicle.
the biggest problems with modern cars are made in mexico all of them suck if you buy a camaro you'll be disappointed when you start taking off to upgrade every part says made in mexico then you'll think fuck i paid a good amount of money for this shit
the fact that people so readily get into debt. i never use loans. not becauase im well off but because i save contingency money for events such as needing to repair my car. you can do it just by saving a very small amount each week, it soon builds up.
the one thing that i think all modern cars should have, is a mechanical transmission. if an emp swept through a wave of modern cars, the software would blank out, and everything would stop working. my beat chevy prizm would still keep driving, though.
they're so ugly and unusable and they probably cost a fortune, also they're so boring. i like how you can turn and puch buttons to switch the radio channel or change airco settings etc. it‘s just more enjoyable, easier and probably costs less to make.
we will end up with piles and piles of 6-7 years old cars, that no one would buy. nobody will give you money you want for 7 years old car, and you wouldn't want to keep it too. i had 18 years old car and it was working fine, now it is just impossible.
you are completely right. some of the mechanics i know won't get a new car at all, even though financially they can. i asked my neighbor what new car he would buy, and he told me none of them. it really is a gimmick just to keep selling you something.
you hit a major target at when you mentioned the manufacturers adding things that shouldn't be in the vehicle in the first place. there are too many drivers already distracted by their damned phones. and now, the makers install even more distractions?
you know cars, but you don't know tech. an old cell phone is fine if it has a good battery. they slow down because the battery craps out. car tech is more robust. a lot of it is complete shit, but it will not need updates in order to keep functioning.
you must be saying that they aren't race cars, any everyday civic in the 90's early 2000's had more character than most new cars. i hope that when i get my first car, it wont be a boring new car, and something reliable, manual and has character to it.
i hope not. a chevy impala in 1960 was $22,000 in today's money. a cadillac started at $40,000. the average family income was $6,900. could the average family in 1960 have bought an impala for 22k, on a 5 year loan, with monthly payment of almost $400?
just buy a second hand car like i do. why so much technology in a car that only brings you from a-to-b. i have bought a renault clio from 2002. not much tech, just a good engine. that car brings me everywhere i want to go. bu, you are absolutely right.
same for the electronics at the trunk. ok i might want the option to unlock my car from a distance, but it does not need it. and god, i want a radio in my car. i really do. i love it and i want it nice. but those screens and such in cars. ugh. get out.
well, i'm good and pissed off and depressed now. great example of all this is modern diesel pickups that spend so much time in the dealer because of how much electronics they have. and i'm not limiting that to emissions controls. great video as always.
well. my list of problems with modern cars is a lot bigger -power steering doesn't give good feedback -bland design -bland engines -excessive electronics gadgets why tf do i need mirrors that fold automatically? -absurd weight a clio with over 1200kg??
you have created what i honestly consider to be one of the most important and meaningful videos that exists on all of youtube. i thoroughly agreed with 100% of everything you said. the only genuine and reliable quality that exists are the old classics!
all those stupid journalists showing that all autopilot tech is today a must have, not keeping their hands on the steering wheel, reading a book, talking with someone on the back seat as if they are on waiting room. and smiling to you this is fantastic!
daily drive a 91 ford. a few hundred in repair costs a year for maintenance and stuff that just wears out cuz its so old. people make fun of me and say you're always working on your truck, why don't you just get a nice new car you don't have to work on?
i am very pleased with my 1967 chevrolet pick up. easy to drive, easy to repair, easy to maintain, cheap insurance, versatile, good looking and it has been paid for for ever. my distractions include a light switch and windshield wiper switch. that's it.
most importantly. 75% features in your car you don't need it. i forget when is the last time i use my sunroof and wirles changing. most people don't need memerable stats and full-size touch screen. i rather to get a better engine than these fancy things
my 1993 chevy corsica didn't even come with a trip meter, and the fuel gauge doesn't work, so i have to write down the mileage when i fill up the tank. that's o.k though, and if i ever need a fuel pump, i'll buy a new fuel sending unit at the same time.
people piss away thousands every year on stupid things like dd coffee or starbucks, smoking. guantees death and healthcare costs. get rid of the crap, buy what you need and the value on vehicles that can last 200-300k v 100 k 25yrs ago becomes apparent.
so don't support it. that is how capitalism works. you can buy a rusty but trusty 92 camry with 300,000 km. radio still works, climate control still works, etc. or if it doesn't, you can easily fix it. why buy brand new if you're struggling financially?
have to disagree. i started driving in the 80s and had cars from every decade since the 60s. my observation is that cars have gotten. more reliable can you imagine getting a bumper bumper warranty back then?, more durable remember the 5.1 digit odometer?
he makes some good points. funny how they are using technology to solve problems caused by technology. having a smart car, smart phone and smart tv does not make you smart. too many phone zombies with zero situational awareness. strange times we live in.
i don’t really get why people are surprised that cars are more expensive now than they were in the past. of course a car with a ton of technology is going to cost more. also, inflation makes the cost of everything go up. it’s not really that complicated.
i hope you're going to do a video that demonstrates automotive configurations that are no longer available, like a true pickup truck. 2 years ago i purchased a 2006 silverado 4.3l v6, 8ft bed, 2wd, std cab truck, with a effin manual 5 speed transmission!
it's all about that lease money for the manufacturers isn't it., planned obsolescence, make em all lease these toys for a while, and they make interest on payments. parts don't last past the warrantees no more. i hear even europeans lease a lot nowadays.
some manufacturers are now offering less built in technology and passing capability to your phone using apple carplay or google android auto. as consumers we can refuse to buy cars unless they are upgradeable like those that connect with carplay or auto.
the public has been sold entitlement and happiness in the form of products. you're an empty, atomised, individuated consumer with no purpose and it's your democratic right to be fulfilled with 'stuff', to be a narcissist and want what the next person has
they put all that stuff in there to justify the price, to charge you more. just like cellphones with 4 or 8 gb of ram, why the fuck do you need 8gb of ram in a stupid cell phone, oh sorry, smart phone for the people that do not know what a cell phone is.
they put in those electronic and computer systems that dont really work now, they half ass work. just like cell phones are basically half ass laptops, yea they are getting more powerful but not quite yet. i will take a resto mod anyday over a modern car.
2000 geo metro 1.4 liter sedan. you can get it for about $1000. it costs $200 for a full set of decent tire's. gets 35-40 mpg. new cvc joints cost 165 for booth. the size may be small but it packs a punch when i do t have to open my pocketbook that often.
i had a keirug coffee machine that had a touchscreen to brew the coffee which stopped working in under 2 years. imagine buying a car and not being able to use the a c, radio, and other features after 2 years simply because the touchscreen stopped working.
i really do not want all this tech, and i would always try to find a car without it, but that is becoming difficult in this modern world. why would i want a car to find a restaurant for me when i have spent all my life finding them myself with no problem?
i've been saying this for awhile now. modern technology with computers, sensors, cameras, etc. it ages the car about three times faster and drives cost up. so then insurance and repair costs go up as well. they need to go back to simplicity with vehicles.
it is so bad that i would't be surprised if they charged you per key press or mouse clicks from now on. there is definitely a growing tendency to get more and more money from people for anything that they can, and this can only have one kind of an ending.
modern american car manufacturers have zero accountability. they are ugly. they don't last. you can't work on them. they are overpriced. cares aren't built for the average man to be able to maintain and upkeep. modern car manufacturers have zero nobility.
on that car loan that u estimated still doesn't show the gap insurance or any warranty the dealer will try to add on to the loan. and plus the insurance your right how people can afford it. i always questioned my neighbors. they have 4 trucks and two suv.
so what you're saying is that poor people moan around and try blaming others for their own failure by not being wealthy enough to buy shit they want. and if say apps are in your car, just use them while you're stationary. jesus people are becoming dumber,
totally agree. the most shocking thing to me is that while even a 150 200 dollar phone-tablet is able to go through the menu and setting smoothly even the most expensive cars including porsche 918 can not. just what kind of tech are they putting in there?
buy a tesla 😉 or actually i asked and vw actually has a schedule to update it’s infotainment over the air for all cars with their 2017 or later hardware. a little late to the party, but at least now they’re starting what tesla has been doing for a decade.
computers. when there working like they should, there gr8. when theres a glitch. there a bitch. have an 06' stang gt. a lot of headaches with computers. old school is basic, i like it. next ride for me is 5th gen elcamino. no smog where i live so woo- hoo!
get a 90s car if you hate all this tech then and stop complaining. sure it will get outdated but a lot of cars connect with phone and let you use your phone instead of what is built in too. i have a 94 camry but i wouldn't mind having a newer one sometime.
i hate mordern cars above 2010 i drive my 2001 bmw 325ci as long i can and buy only cars bevor this date for the rest of my life im 21 that will be a long time im a oldtime collector next time i buy a car vrom the 80s 90s maby a ford escort or a opel manta
lol most of these things are options. most people choose to take out a loan for buying financing a car. hell, most people buying new cars choose to do so. if they go into debt because they chose something they couldn't afford, that's on them. stop whining.
my friend told me parts for these new cars are so expensive even the auto mechanics at the dealer buy the extended warranties. while they know how to fix them, they can not afford the parts. i often wonder how well a simple basic car would sell now a days.
my nephew has been working on getting his license. in a recent driving test, he failed because he looked at the backup camera instead of the mirrors when he backed up. he'd have his license now if he'd been driving an older car without all these features .
new car 30-40k and you have to have specific tools and jump through hoops to change anything on them. 20 year old car 1k-8k, can change anything you want about then and spend the extra 20k saved on things that actually matter, like fuel, food, family, mdma
technology is going to make a owning a car something people with too much money do. unless it's a classic. look at it this way, i can fly to a city for less than the cost of train journey, in fact there's enough money left over for a days car hire, even 2!
this is wrong. on top of that, most of these items won't fail anytime soon, hopefully. i had a 97 civic with the original fuel pump at 160k miles. these prices are complete bs unless you're probably buying straight from honda. on top of that why would you?
couldn't agree more. all my cars so far have been easy to work on and affordable, because they were 10+ years old. and they were great, nothing wrong with them. some of my mates buy brand new and have nothing but problems and costs. plus a monthly payment?!
i 100% agree, i bought an 2008 toyota yaris with absolutely no bells and whistles, even has crank windows, and standard transmission. the only part of that car that will need maintenance will be the engine. i intend to keep that car for the rest of my life.
i couldn't agree more. that's why i drive a 35 year old car that i can do the repairs on myself. i can afford a new car but i don't one. i also switched back to a flip phone from a smart phone and i just love it. i feel i have a lot more control of my life.
i got my first car,a golf 4. it`s pretty much still a car. looking at 6`s,7`s pfew. they start to look more and more like spaceships. meh,considering mine is 17 years old and with pretty cheap maintenance,guess it can do few more years till the next. golf 4
i remember when my friend tried to connect his phone up to my moms 2013 ford fusion it would make the entire system crash and pop up a error saying “application desktop.exe encountered a serious error and must shut down” me and my friend were dying laughing
i saw a long-term test from an italian car magazine on the fiat 500 just an example, they drove for 200k km with basically only consumables and an unexpected arm of the front suspension. new cars are more expensive to repair but they need far fewer repairs.
its the same here in the uk, people all aspire to own these hideous suv's that are huge. mostly not 4x4, cost a fortune to buy and run and at the end of the day are simply status symbols. the other problem with most modern cars is they are all so damn ugly!
my last car was a subaru gl 4-door small sedan. that was just over 20 years ago. since then, i've been riding motorcycles in southern taiwan where it never snows, the last two decades of suvs kills me. with fuel prices so high, why would anyone want an suv?
stupid looking one car pride parades rolling down the highway. then when you get in one it feels like a toy version of what a real car used to be. cheap ass junk. millennials have cars that compliment their generation perfectly. garbage, just like they are.
that's the problem with the millenials today. oh and you don't go getting involved with a woman when your in your 20's either. oh sure lots of people do, they get married and they pound out the kids. we have a name for such people. we call them poor people!
wow, i didnt know that. now i feel better about my 2004 crossfire. good thing my father taught me to do maintenance on that little bugger. it still runs like a champ. and i only need to buy parts to do the maintenance myself. i dont need no fancy mechanics.
you buy a falling apart piece of shit car like we all did back in the day. my first car was a 1965 chevy nova that i got for a mere $100. sure it'd be more than $100 now a days but it would be nowhere near $40k either. maybe say $1000. and you deal with it!
even really important shit, like furnaces, aren't built to last now. the last thing i want is a fridge that makes ice so that it can break and leak. or a digital display on the front of a stove so hot water oil can get inside and destroy it. it's all a scam.
eventually-or even today-some car maker will make a fortune producing a simple practical reliable-and not sexy car-that normal folks can actually buy and maintain. that will happen once the public wakes up to how they are getting ripped off by all this tech.
i never borrowed money to buy a car. i always bought the cheapest car i could get away with. i always fixed my own cars. a couple of years ago i bought my first new car for cash. if you want peace of mind don't buy into what is obviously a ridiculous system.
i totally agree with this video, both on #1 and #2. that's why my first car a car i totally payed by myself is a 2004-2005 honda civic type r. no useless tech and because its a honda it will last forever. prices where i live are about 6000 usd for a good one
in today's world cars are just to go back and forth to work. sad, cars are just not fun to own. my car is 35 years old 325k on it, and i do the work on it myself. because it's easy to work on. yeah, it's old and my wife would like me to buy a newer one. but.
my first car cost $4000. of course, cars were cheaper in 1991. but now, 25 years later i own two vehicles a pickup truck i got for $2000 and a sedan i got for $1200. some people just need a dose of reality. you need a way to get to work, not a status symbol.
new cars have never been cheap. solution if you're single let the rich buy cars and buy bikes. just buy a 3000$ grand tour bike from 10 years ago and it will work. forever. solution for families buy a van with seats from 15 years ago, they go from 2000-5000$
these are some things especially the idiotic touchscreens i didn't think much about. that being said, i'm pretty sure hyundai is the best buy if you just a want a no-bullshit car that will last you a long time with no issues and it's actually a good car too.
doesn't get it. go watch that video of a '59 malibu vs an '09 malibu. exaggerated effect due to the huge age difference, but it's more like that. size and weight aren't everything. and the first point, if you're too broke to buy a $40k car don't buy one then!
exactly, my 2011 bmw info tainmwnt has lost its 2g platform because the verizon bmw deal is finished and 2 g is finished. i can't update, now have no collision response or emergency button. car runs great but have lost features, i can update maps via usb tho.
he says he also shit his pants up to $300 worth when hearing the price of a car from the salesman. duh. look at stickers first. look online. look at pre-owned vehicles. but then again, what the hell should we expect from someone using a name like savagegeese.
my 1997 lincoln mark viii lsc might last forever it hasn't broken down in years. aside from regular maintenance, it never sees a repair shop. the last good mechanic i knew retired right now, if i needed one, i don't even know a good mechanic. i love this car.
nhtsa regulations are causing a lot of this. requiring a million airbags, that costs a lot of money and adds a lot of weight. i believe in the next year or so backup cameras are mandated, so you're going to have to have a screen somewhere in your car anyways.
one thing that pisses me off is that instead of saving on the fancy lcd screen gimmicks the budget brands save on build quality instead. granted, the second rate electronics may be cheaper to replace, but everything will break more often than on premium cars.
you can all buy oldtimers if you like. i will always buy cars which are one year old. and i'm totally happy with all my assistants and technology. it's called progress. you remind me of the german emperor noone needs an automobile, i will stick with my horse.
bro the term mistress is for the hooker you fuck while your married, or the woman you fuck around with your wife on. it is not a term you use for the mother of your children. be careful bro. don't go telling some girl you like i'm gonna me you my mistress lmao
did that. me and my gf both have a degree, and we just about get by. in england the average wage is £20k a year, i don't know how people survive. in england the poorest haven't had a pay rise above the rate of inflation since 1970, according to the world bank.
feel u braw. but this is how everything works these days. no matter if you are an afgan citizen or american. government are not for democracy. period. every business is there to fool people. so chill u can't change that. or simply. build your own from scratch.
i do not recall many people when i was younger buying new cars everything is relative cars cheaper back in the day and min wage was 5$ lol, cars today are retarded, to much un needed tech, i upgraded my 88 to a touch screen i put velcro on the back of my phone
i just paid $545 for a starter on a 2001 hyundai sonata at pep boy's in coral springs, florida. they knew i could not get a second opinion on a car that was towed in and not running. a mobile mechanic come to your house and charge fair prices most of the time.
i made mistake number 1. i bought a new honda crv and at first i was happy. but the more i drove it the worst i saw that it was a horrable value. how people are ok with paying $30,000 for a crossover blows my mind. when i was a kid. $30k was a nice luxury car!
i'm told mercedes & bmw have an auto release so that should we find ourselves in deep water sinking, flooding etc one can just turn a level, the driver window drops into the door and one can escape that way. all cars without thise feature turn into tombs, wtf!
thank you so much for this vidio. i really really needed that becouse so often i have been jealous or frustrated in my 20's and early 30s as to how the hell these people are getting new cars in what seems like no time at all. i run a 01 dodge ram 2nd gen baby!
way way too many electronics, anything before 2006 can actually be maintained without needing an expert. oh, and we also need to deal with many many more advanced, and what i would consider just rational malfunctions now days. its like the plot for terminator.
even if you bought a 20 year old toyota that everything failed in it and you completely rebuilt that car and even spent 10-15k. new transmission and new motor that's going to be a better investment in 10 years than any new car you're going to drive off the lot.
i hate the visibility in modern cars. parking a ford kuga was a real challange for me but when i do it in 2001 seat alhambra its very easy. if you buy the cheapest option without the parking sensors and back cameras you are not able to park anything these days.
people are idiots. this is just a symptom of the peak credit cycle. they buy 1200 dollar iphones that do basically the same shit that smartphones have done for 10 years. eventually the money tide will go back out and leave a lot of people broke. but until then!
the car industry is just like the insurance industry, they exist to only make $$$$, not to help you out. i believe that this is the first rule of capitalism, exist to make $$$$$. not to actually care about the consumer but to enslave them. welcome to our world!
we service fleet cars at work, and government workers are lazy shits like the union bosses. they don't clean there cars, check oil, look after it why they break down. a lot of government workers don't deserve cars to drive. and who forks out the bill tax payers
well there are always those chinese wildfire cars going for 6k and doing 70mpg. nobody would dare to touch them of course since the safety standards and performance are not good. my point is you can't have all safety, cheap maintenance, economy and a low price.
i agree with the video except that this is problem caused by capitalism. it's caused by bad management. socialism doesn't make better design decisions. car should have hard buttons for most controls and touch screens should be able to be swapped out like phones.
i am 15 years old and i want to be an enginer. for a long time i have thought of going to technologi a 2000 car have and upgrade it not chage it beacus i grew up in one. and it rearly fail compeard to a 2010 car like we have now. and that is beacus all the tech!
i figured out one day that if you were to take a new bottom of the line 1 2 ton p u with an average price today of 50 grand add the 4 year interest, the 4 years of full coverage insurance, 4 years of tags, you'd be at around 85 grand when it's all said and done!
i watched the rest of the video. imagine if any of these modern cars ever made it to the age of out 91 cavalier. all of that electronic climate control crap, yeah we all know that's not going to work anymore. the car would have to be junked based upon age alone.
mr savage you are dead on, i work at gm technical center, these cars are pure junk, the electronics are designed to last 3 years 36,000 miles, 15 to 20 body control modules and ecm, they fail from heat and vibration, anything to steal your money, corporate scams
my sister in laws mom is loaded and she refuses to give up her pontiac sunfire. it’s actually quite admirable. i don’t know how she does it but she just refuses to buy a new vehicle. it’s hard to not get the newest and shiniest toy in my world. ugh, consumerism!
good luck taking your opinion to the car manufacturer's. the truth is that the majority of people don't know this and go after the latest tech as soon as it appears in cars.after college i plan on getting a used civic. it's a reliable car, simple, and affordable.
i am still in my final year of university doing my bachelor. but it seems that you are just ranting about the technology offered in modern cars. i am learning that its not very easy to survive, but depending on the location, one just adapts. i could go on and on.
i love my cadillac srx station wagon. however, recently a front turn signal bulb burned out. the dealer wanted $250 to replace the bulb. that is because the car is constructed so that it is necessary to dismantle half the front of the car body to get at the bulb!
i'm so scared for the future, i'm pretty young right now and all the good old car models are still available. but i'm wondering if eventually all the old cars are going to be harder and harder to find as i get older. i will have to buy a piece of shit modern car.
oh man than guy in blue car caused that white car to wreck, wonder how badly he was injured?, thanks for video, i had a new 2016 honda civic with that damned touch screen, many times i could not remember anything i had seen or passed while being distracted by it.
regardless of the car you get it'll break sooner or later it's more of a personal preference when it comes to keeping a 80s 90s car that's on its last wheel or going ahead and updating to a newer model car either way both will cause problems nothing lasts forever
sure, go ahead, don't get it because it is also an extra. and i don't know, but i'm sure cars are becoming more reliable not less. the cost of repairs might of gone up, but what matters if your car is actually more reliable and requires less frequent maintenance?
that's why i bought a 98 toyota truck. it has manual windows,no cruise control or automatic door locks and a simple sound system. plus, i can easily work on most areas of the truck. new gadgets are great on a car when new but wait until they break. and they will!
cant believe that i missed this video. thought i was the only guy that thought new cars just cost to freaking much to buy. finance for 6 years and it is a mortgage payment at least. and all the electronics they stuff into new cars, they also cost a fortune to fix!
headlight lens that oxidize to save a few cents on gas, but cost more to repair or replace when the light is so defused you can't see. black buttons on a black dash in the black of night. doors so high that you can't see the lines in the parking lot when you park.
i’m so tired of the tech race. they are in the self driving early stages. cars with 8 cameras and speed controls. go see demolition man or minority report etc. next thing you know, your ex calls the cops on you and you just get arrested by your own car. happy now?
only problem with my car is when i step in the transmission fluid slick. no hard to use electronics, the knobs are easy to feel out while driving, and it's just a better looking vehicle than what we have today. even an '04 or an '00 is better than modern vehicles.
solution buy an old japenise car eg. honda civic, toyota corolla etc. cheap, reliable, parts everywhere and you get that satisfaction that you arent one of those stuck-up snobby queers driving new cars that loose 75% of their value the second they leave the dealer
things that were easily inexpensively fixed. now recalls are all about the basics. transmissions, fuel injections, braking. all terribly expensive necessities. they all come from making vehicles too complex, and things break. create the problem, market the repair.
what is going to be more archaic about a screen that shows you the album art and track info of what you're playing over bluetooth than those crappy old one line led displays that show cd text. if you're lucky. this is just antitech contrarian bs for youtube views.
you make a great point about the updating on tech. i think the new features are mostly positive convenient, but having a razor flip phone for 10 years sounds a bit silly. if the manufacturers update the software on a regular basis, i think it will make more sense.
your rant about technology is also why i hate being stuck with electronic bling that i will never use. i will probably wait until the warranty runs out and then, yank the useless rear camera because it's so damn unreliable. if it jams, i'm locked out of the trunk!
1968 m35a2. push button start, direct injection, and turbocharged. no power anything. including steering. lol. 50 years of reliable service and given its current condition, i'd say another 50 should be a piece of cake. no need for a new car in my foreseeable future
american cars have been throwaway since the late 70s or early 80s. japanese and european cars have been disposable since the mid to late 90s. its sad because it seems like the only vehicles that are made to last anymore are pickup trucks, and i fucking hate trucks.
i cannot stand all of these stuff in modern cars. i don't want 'infotainment'. what i want from a car is a relationship. a car that is fun and engaging to drive. modern cars are little more than white goods. suddenly, cars from the 80's, 90's seem charming and fun.
i completely agree, also if you need drivers aid maybe you shouldnt be driving. my car is from 1988, if i need to know if someone is beside me i turn my head, we were all taught to look when driving. cant blaim your lane detection sensors when you crash its all you
oh my word, now that would be fun, for if that is what you want, you go to a very expensive custom car creator and it is tailored for you. if not, well, you are there to pay the money, make the payments, drive it until you no longer like it, and then buy a new car!
the technology is definitely useless. all the same stuff is available on your phone. the only cars i've owned have been 1996 and 2003 and have driven a rental 2016 and i don't miss it. the steering response and tip-tronic shifting is nice but i can live without it.
when i can option a car or truck the way i want it and not the way they want me to buy it i will start buying them again. as it stands today you pick a model and a very poor choice for a color and that is it. go fuck yourself gm ford dodge hyundai honda toyota etc.
cars today are low quality garbage, especially those electric cars. they won't last very long and there are so many extra and intricate little components to break down. not to mention that every possible thing that can be made out of plastic, is made out of plastic.
fuck all the unnecessary technology, they can shove all of it up their a-holes, i sure as hell am not buying into that nonsense. i'm all for technological development, but, in the words of the great scottie kilmer. technology for its own sake, is just plain stupid .
haven't driven too many, but compared to my old car the two things that i find annoying are haptics can't do things by touch alone in many newer cars, and a-pillar bloat don't care for crap blocking my view, isn't there a better place to reinforce or pack an airbag?
hyundai i30 hatch has non of these issues lol. if the lcd dies tomorrow the car is still 100% usable. its only for entertainment purposes that's it super simple design. mpi egnine, standard 6 speed auto. normal hand break. turn key start. this car will last forever!
i completely agree with the second point. buttons are more safe and more easy to use than touch screens and they cost less to repair or fix incase of any problems. like you said, whaty's the point of having a yelp app in the car when you cn just use your smartphone.
i recently bought a subaru xv crosstrek in 2018. it's a 2014. one of the last years i could get it without all the cameras, touchscreen, and the highers level fancy stuff. it has a cd player and bluetooth, i'm more than happy. that's plenty of tech in my car for me.
that's why in 2017 i bought a new 2015 nissan versa note base model for $13k. i get a average of 40mpg, manual transmission, manual windows,manual door locks,am fm radio and that's it. no bells n whistles. $25 to fill up the tank and 3 qts of oil during oil changes.
this is one the best car videos on youtube, my 20 year old car built near columbus oh runs great. its not a theft target and i don't waste money on excessive insurance. base cost to own and maintain it is well under $2,000 per year in the 2nd most expensive us city.
we’re reaching the limits of technology, henry ford with the car, the rise of pc the iphone, after that, since 2007, there have been no real technological innovation that makes a meaningful impact on people’s life therefore how do these companies keep earning money?
i drive a 98 corolla even though i could afford a brand new car. i just dont see the point. no need to insure because it has no nominal value, repairs are cheap and easy. it takes me around just the same as a 30k more expensive car. i rather spend my money elsewhere.
i know this is a little niggle but as a delivery driver i n otice alot of cars driving around without their headlights on. how hard is it to have the dashlights come on when you turn the headlights on but no. turn the key and it lights up like christmas tree, stupid.
climate systems have been the biggest scam. only 2 settings are needed. hot air. cold air. when its freezing cold or blazing hot outside, no one cares about setting the temp to 73 degrees. always a waste of time and money for junk that is worse the old standard knobs.
each item looks to be roughly around twice as expensive for the newer car, except the injector port is more like five times, and although the fuel pump is less than twice, the newer car total ought to be somewhere in hollering distance of double the older car's total.
i drive a 1966 ford galaxie 390. i can get a whole new engine for $4000, or a new gearbox for $600. i do my own old school servicing and its value is rising not going down. now lexus is pretty cheap believe it or not, campared to its euro rivals. you have been warned.
i hope they just find a balance of touchcreen and analog, i think that this will just make a big market for vehicle specific devices that tap into your current system, and if tesla keeps updating their cars other manufacturers will have no choice to compete with that.
i spent 30 years in the design and engineering side of the us auto industry. there are 2 cores areas of a vehicle that has no design limits 1 styling, 2 electronics. all other systems ans components have reached their development pinnacle. these two have not. styling?
i work for a collision shop & i can tell you that in 2013 auto body repairs were projected to decline rapidly in the 5 years following the implementation of all of the anti crash systems in modern cars. the crash rate has stayed the same because of distracted drivers.
it also depends where you live. where i live, student loans don't even exist because no one needs it here. it's not that we have a lot of money, but it is easier to get started. a normal student job is enough to pay high school or university and still have money left.
it is amazing how many people in the comments section think they are being forced to buy a new car. if you live in the usa you are free to drive whatever you want. as long as it is properly maintained and is not a hazard to other drivers on the road in their new cars!
the infotainment systems are a crock of shit uneeded and they are going to age like shit. subaru was late to the game i believe because they hoped that it was a phase?, but i believe here recently they are reluctantly putting the shit in only because everyone else is.
this is honist why i buy older cars with less tech when i look at cars i look at what it cost how to fix it and can i the more tech in a a car makes i heavy and useless i think cars should go back a little i have a 2005 ford focus it's a very basic car easy to work on
explanation these days more new cars are sold to women than men. figure it out----take it from there. they demand these socalled safety comforts. that way they can talk on their cell phones from the moment they start until they turn off their vehicles. gross, isn't it?
my 20k mazda 3 is doing just fine for me and i have no problem making the payment with 30k income a year. it's all about your expenses, control your expenses and you can afford a car and a place to live and still live happily, doesn't mean it's easy, but it can be done
that is the biggest reason why i'm fixing an almost 70 year old car up to be a daily driver. i like the lack of complex computers that control every part of a car. the only computer i'm gonna have in my car is in the efi system i'm adapting on to the car and that's it.
that is why no one should buy a car above 2000 ish year or never sell his old one. i drive a merc 1999 and it has all the stuff i need to be safe and confort. the car costs round 3k to buy and repair costs 1 time every 2 years are pocket money. compared to modern shit.
the biggest problem for me is they are taking away manual transmissions. i just purchased a honda civic sport hatchback and it's a stripped down technology wise. it's manual, and it's going to last a long time just like my 03 civic ex that i traded in at 225,000 miles.
well working for toyota we do have radio updates you own a high end brand of kia hyundai but we sell new corollas for less than 20k that are fully loaded and even camrys for 25k when you go buying the luxury brand of course it's gonna be really really expensive dumbass
ya tec needs to be limited on cars. it's really exspensive to fix and it fails. some is good like telling you if a missfire or other issues. but not all this accident avoidance crap. you should buy a car after 3 years or more for depresiation and keep for 5, 10+ years.
blaming capitalism for this is stupid. capitalism does far more good than it does harm and socialism causes much more harm than good. if you didn't have all the choices that capitalism offers, you would be complaining that you don't have enough choices available to you.
i have a 2016 nissan frontier sv that i bought new. it doesn't have any of the stuff that many of these modern cars have in them. the controls are hard dials and buttons. the nissan frontier is probably the last vehicle that you'll ever be able to get this way for 2018.
that was actually a very straightforward user interface and i adapted to it quite quickly. far less distracting than the stupid mylink display in modern gms, or that horrendous screen shown in the lexus in the video. egads, that has no business being installed in a car.
touchscreens are not only complicated but also more unsafe. after a while, you can use muscle memory to operate any switch in the cockpit without looking. not so with touchscreens, you always need to check. they say dont text while driving, but this 10 touchscreen here?
you can get a used nissan versa 2014-2015 model for about $10,000 as well. the car has great mileage, basic utilities that you find from new cars, and you can find them with very low mileage 35k below, new cars aren't the problem, it's people choice in certain vehicles.
all i want in a car is bluetooth connection to my smartphone, and an up to date navigation system. but no, the map data is proprietairy, meaning you pay for example a 2003 to 2007 ford mondeo 300€ to 400€ for updated maps from 2010 and not newer because incompatibility .
biggest problem is that for servicing one has to quit their job for the day and sit there waiting for it or use their shuttle service. their shuttle service hours were not conducive with my work hours so i had to miss work and not get paid while paying them for servicing
capitalism works one way please the buyer enough that they pay for whatever it is you're trying to sell. manufacturers don't intentionally sell problems so that later they can sell the solution. they wouldn't make any money because who the hell is going to buy a problem?
i love my older car, i have a gps but i have simple controls that are behind the steering wheel that i can use my pointer finger without ever taking my hand off the wheel. and it rises out of the dash and sits closer to the road than something that sits as low as stereo.
if 5 people bought the orig type 1 beetle for everyone buying a new vw, mexico would not stop around 2001. even in the depression, the public thinking was drive a model a or walk but not the old model t. if you study this subject honestly its more of the consumers fault.
if my remote door key dies, i pop out the switchblade like key in the fob, to physically open the door. no infotainment system to distract, just a great stereo, i can get navigation off my phone, thank you, and it talks to me so my eyes are on the road. until i get lost.
nothing wrong to aim high, but, know your limitations. aside from the $$$$, blame on the government for regulations and safety requirements to manufacturers. ultimately the costs to build and include all the idiocy gadgets and electronics are imposed on to the consumers!
too much stuff to go wrong and too much electronics. how is it i am not allowed to simply answer the cell phone while driving ie hold it to my head and talk yet these new cars have computer displays which require you to take your eyes off the road to find the right menu?
very expensive high performance cars. because they are made for driver, to be driven. most other modern cars are more like small family rooms these days. with all the entertainment devices needed to keep modern adults from snapping during a 30 minute car trip due to add.
yeah this is what worries me about my scion ia. it costs $17,500 to buy and is a cheap sub compact with a touch screen, back up camera, smart city brake system, etc. i wonder how much would it cost me later on to fix those things once it craps out after the warranty ends
i mean i totally disagree. i'm not going to go into a whole explain but to put it simply, you're an adult, you have a very wide range of new cars to choose from from low to high every suv is clearly not $40k or more, do your resesrch and choose what you want to deal with.
my problem with modern cars is electronics.way,way too much of it.all i want is base model,analog car with below 2.0 engine,around 100hp and 5 speed tranny.that's it.closest i found was hyundai accent and toyota yaris but i'm told yaris doesn't come in basic trim anymore.
plain and simple the more bullshit tech that goes into new cars, the dumber and worse people are at driving and life in general. technology has pretty well topped out and now makes everyone worse as a whole the more time goes on. i'll stick to my pre 2010 cars and trucks.
the issues that you outline extend waaaaay beyond cars in my opinion. consumerism sadly is a way of life in most developed countries. i am not hating and i’m not saying “having stuff is bad”, it’s just that we’re now addicted to buying sh*t. gives us short term happiness.
wow, half the video is actually just talking about you cant afford it that is simple math and if you cant actually afford it then dont buy it. the other half is about new technology built in. just buy an old car and watch how it errodes under your ass without maintainance
driving an ugly shit box corolla from 1999. except i had to build in a new engine bad luck with the old engine, previous owner is a dick and replace some other small parts. it's still driving pretty well. i kinda know which kind of state my car is and i can fix it my self!
i absolutely agree and thats why im putting a new engine in my old pickup truck. i did the math and it's going to pay. cost 10 grand to put new engine in my truck and fix all the miscellaneous problems and broken stuff to compare to buying a new full size truck cost 2700$!
i think the problem is that so many drivers have made it clear that they have no intention of putting down their cell phones so the manufacturers have decided to take some of the driving responsibilities away from them like breaking when getting too close to the car ahead.
if you can't own it, lease it. that simple. you aren't slammed by depreciation, and the service costs are still within warranty. at that point, sign up for a lease for the range that it turns into a certified pre-owned with some warranty benefits once the contract is over.
thank you for saying this stuff. i don't ever plan to buy a truck that isn't the most basic model if i can. that's if i buy newer than the 2000's generation. but i'm worried for when that may no longer be an option. that being said i also plan to keep my 91 running forever
they are still working out the kinks of how to set up all the electronics, both input and output. wrote that before even watching. i wasn't too far off his point 2. in fact for the first time ever, i bought the extended warranty and that was because of all the electronics.
tv's, computers, base appliances, etc have all came down through the years but car prices have risen. insurance companies and the epa has dictated that all car buyers pay through the nose for stuff we didn't choose to equip our cars with. the consumer should have a choice!
and point number one is exacerbated by bubble-worthy financing. 0 down and 1 percent air, securitized by a depreciating asset, the manufacturers can price them however they want since the vast majority of people will over leverage themselves for that sweet, sweet yolo life.
brakes are mostly disc which are easily to change. the old drum brakes in the back end often made more trouble than brakepower which gives trouble today are some elecxtronic issues but here i think the asia brands are still a bit ahead in reliability than our german brands!
i don't get why modern cars are all luxury cars no matter the brand like why would somebody pay $40,000 for a chevy, if you wanted luxury 30 or even as recently as 10 years ago you'd buy a buick or a cadillac but what's the point when all the cars are around the same price.
interior sound levels are very high at highway speeds. they put gas guzzling automatic transmissions in trucks instead of the very economical bullet proof manual transmission that will get 5 miles per gallon better mileage. manufactures just don't listen to their customers.
need tough lemon laws that punish manufactures with even long prison terms for selling shit and the death penalty for unsafe vehicles often they continue to sell vehicles that have known problems that customers end up in a fatal crash. all to make money for the manufactures
prices on used parts decrease as the car gets older. on factory parts and you have the option of aftermarket parts. wile a headlight for a 2016 civic may be $450 in 2016. it will drop to $300 in 2021. that is not even taking into account inflation. still agree with you 100%
stop complaining. you get a lot for your money in new cars, just compare them with the death trap, lead polluting cars from the 1960s. as for the complexity technology, well, most of that falls on government regulations regarding safety and emissions, not the manufacturers.
tech i agree. i hate the screens. touchscreens are a horrible user interface for distracted driving. the key you want is buried in menus, so you have to look at the screen. critics ragged on porsche for the “herringbone” button arrangement on the center console, but really?
technology is good, but we are in a society where technology and electronics exist to make us spend money more often cars, computers, cellular phones, etc, that's why car manufacturers don't make cars like old honda civic or toyota corolla or even the war tank mercedes 190d
yes, all that overpriced useless tech is outdated as soon as you buy it and it just jacks up the price of the car and the future repairs. they can't build quality anymore so they resort to gimmicks that millennials eat up. fucking retards can't even drive a stick shift ffs.
great video but it's a timeless problem, aside from touch panels my father has been expressing his concerns about the very same things in this video since the 70s. from my perspective, cars have gotten cheaper to buy and run but getting more expensive to maintain and repair.
how true it is, touch screen dies, get one from a wrecker, not likely, and even if you could, would it not require a dealer to provide the updates and whatever else to make it function, codes required etc., how do you dispose of a second hand car if there is no parts backup?
i found a 2002 mazda pick-up on line for $4200. paid cash. problem #1. solved. it has a 5-speed manual transmission, am & fm stereo, a c, heater, and full analog gauges. the damn thing looks and runs like new almost, problem #2. solved. i absolutely love my li'l green truck!
i once saw a review of the toyota scion gt86 subaru brz and the one reviewing it kept on bashing the car for the lack of equipment. but honestly you get big weels, sport seats, hifi stereo, a c, abs, a compotent engine, rwd and a good drivers position. what more do you want?
in number two. that guy talks soo passively where he does describe one thing of a problem, but puts everything like in a bowl. like in a previous video i seen where he is bashing the new ford escape saying 'this car isnt good. the things inside is not good', but what things?
touchscreens are the worst idea in a car. the whole reason the buttons and knobs on a stereo are designed the way they are is so that you can feel your way around the controls without having to take your eyes off the road. touchscreens require you to look away from the road.
well that's i'm such a fan of my 2009 nissan versa. manual transmission, no abs, no traction contol, no esp, no touch screen, no bluetooth no distractions. when you focus solely on driving it makes you safer. it has taught me more about driving safely am i'm thankful for it.
you are so right in number 1, apart from a mortgage, i have never had a debt in my life. i saved and bought all my cars with no loans. you are so right in this video, i hate heater controls that arent simple knobs, in my glc the heaters in in a row of ten identical switches.
your math is all wrong. assuming your total price for parts is correct, it's a 36% increase, not 27% on the other hand, if your price per part is correct, the total 2006 cost is $967 the newer vehicle total is correct at $1,857 -- this is a 92% increase in the cost of parts.
all the nonsense which is being put into new cars will render them unusable one day. but look at motorcycles the trend is the same tft touchscreens simulating an analog dash., keyless ignition. phone pairing, cameras instead of mirrors, cornering lights and fucking turbos!???
cars are like politicians theyre exactly like politicians the problem isn't the criminal politician. the problem isn't the insanely expensive cars. the problem is the public itself. your friends and family are very, very dangerous ppl. and i am not wrong in any way whatsoever
i drive 94' hatch. i have wheels, steering, heating, and for 20$ i installed usb radio. my phone is my navigation and does good job. only issues is that i don't have ec and cold air during summers, but my car i bought only for 350$. i saved big money for gasoline and travels.
nice vid right on the money, they are almost money pits if you would, me i get a car with nothing in terms of bells and whistles period, i did auto tech work i am old school and i beleive your right, i am on your side ,,, now there are people that have more money then brains?
tactile displays would be a great step forward. that means, not just some cheap vibration you get like from your phone but buttons that you can acutally feel on the touch screen and push without looking at them. the prototypes exist, it's just not out there for consumers yet.
that's why hyundai and kia are leaders now in new car reliability. their infosystem and car computer system is so powerful and working flawlessly. i bought a kia sedan and after almost 3 years of driving. not even single one breakdown or repair. and the infosystem is so good!
unless you piss off a motorcyclist i doubt you'll ever pay a 27% up charge. also some other things on those categories are even comparable not the mention you grabbed some of the lowest values to compare to higher ones. compare a 2004 cadillac to a freaking honda. same price?
as we know there are many other downsides to owning a modern vehicle. in new zealand i find many of the late model imports have the headlight beams set too high giving the oncoming motorists the impression the driver has the high beams on. this causes quite a bit of road rage.
great to see americans complaining about car costs, you do realise most of asia has 100-200% taxes on cars. take for example cost of hyundai elantra in india is the same as the cost of a mustang in the united states. and i'd say there are two times the number of cars in india.
hey, just found this. i think the real reason cars are so expensive is financing. the easy ability to borrow money to buy something artificially inflates consumer purchasing power. cars, houses, anything bought on credit will be more expensive simply because people use credit.
i admit. i just bought a 16000e car. it's expensive, my next 5 years are pretty much dealt with financial wise. i'm done. first time it breaks down, in addition to the montly payment, i'm paying like 500 for a part i probably dont even need. i don't like this situation at all.
i had a conversation with someone over this, i told them about the cheapest car you can buy, which is the base model chevy sonic hatchback. she was very surprised when i told her it was only $13,000, though she was more surprised there aren't more offerings in that price range
i wonder why don't they take a car from say 2008, something with good crash rating like vw passat or acura tl, and just start producing today, with no technology in it. abs and that's it. radio and cruise control. wouldn't that be a cheap way to get young people into new cars?
i'm 60yo, to preface. when i first start hearing that modern cars are impossible to work on back in the 1980s-90s, i did not agree. but now i agree. with auto-start-stop, you can't even get the engine to start without the dealer tech gear. can't bleed brakes without tech gear.
my favorite part about modern cars is how terrible the infotainment systems perform meanwhile my $400 phone any modern system away. even the expensive cars cut corners which to me is hilarious since i'm sure anyone would gladly pay the extra cost for something that isn't shit.
the reason it is this way is 1 government regulations and 2, because people demand more and more things, its the same thing with everyother modern invention, people want it faster, hotter, more showy. and companies in an effort to stau relevant answer the call of the consumer.
the worst part about the expensive family car is that they try and push a giant suv as something you need. yes, i need a car half the size of my house to get my ass and only my ass to work, or that i need that to fit the groceries that i am able to carry myself out to the car?
we just sold a 2004 lexus rx330. almost every control was thru the touchscreen. it was not a big deal. we never update the nav system since we don’t often go places that are unfamiliar and if we do, our cell phone gets it done. i don’t agree that an infotainment system is bad.
amen brother, cadillac sts touch screen failed, $4600 at dealer, went to junk yard $300 plus $50 to have unlocked. that thing is the heart of the vehicle and is now so outdated. the car runs and drives excellent, it is the technology that is failing. never buy another cadillac.
it takes something as simple as adjusting the volume impossible half the time and inconvenient the rest. you cant even adjust you fan or anything for like 10 seconds until the pos boots up. i'm glad i watched this, reading the comments makes me happy i'm not alone in this boat.
my accountant friend thinks this is the next sub prime. cars are soooo expensive, when you compare and old car price to modern price, but them see what you can buy for the modern price, you can see that cars are not like computers or tv's or videos, they are getting like houses
this is just spot on. i'm a guy that likes technology and think all these features that makes cars more like a playstation is fun. but in the end most of it is useless. i think it's ok if your passengers can get a lot of things to play with. but the driver should drive the car.
this is such a great op-ed vid. one that no one else seems to address. i wish mainstream auto journalists had the balls to call this stuff out. everything feels like it's designed and built for a 3 yr lease nowadays. on that note, what do you think of the civic hatchback sport?
you can lease a car or purchase extended warranty for up to 8 years so you wont have to pay for repairs. and if you don't like the technology, buy a basic car. it's cheaper to buy and maintain too. and probably will keep you from nagging. also why do you sound so bored talking?
god i hope 3rd party companies figure out a way to replace the bullshit touchscreen hvac controls with three knobs like in an old toyota temperature fan speed where the air goes and an ac button to disengage the compressor clutch if you've got a 4 banger like me, that shit helps
here's one solution to the deficit of money you had while you were 20 years old get in the real estate business. at least in my state you can be 18 years old to have a license. literally, properties are flying everywhere in the blink of an eye. a ged is a great qualifier for it.
i feel like this video was specifically created to trash modern cars because i'm an older person so older cars are better type of mentality, if you are investing money in a car that you can't afford maintenance sounds to me like you are just an idiot and it being a person issue.
i was never into cars or into mechanical stuff and i'm 30 now but a few months ago i decided to give my 9 yr old civic a remodel and do it myself. i have to say, i'm enjoying all i'm learning and saving a lot by doing it myself. i invested in tools and it's definitely paying off
if you don't want it, don't buy it. if it costs too much, don't buy it. if you want to complain about things costing too much money, there is a simple way to save money. buy a used canadian nissan micra manual without air conditioning. or just don't buy the stuff you don't like!
never spend more than $15,000 to at the most $20,000 on a car. a car is not like a house or a business, it doesn't create equity or networth. it looses value fast especially all these new junk plastic cars with smart everything that go dumb after two three years without updates.
same here. honda accord 2005 2.0l 3500eur last year, accord 2009 newer model 10 000eur. mechanic and accord enthusiast told me these will last, they are more simple, easier and cheaper to fix. got your points and agreed. until i am filthy rich no way i am going to buy a new car.
the reason the manufacturers are enabled to cram all that shit in to these cars is because of how popular leasing has become in the states. it's become pretty lucrative to lease and then sell a cpo car. so long as the consumer enables them they're going to just keep on doing it.
your 42,000 car type would probably cost me 200,000 in my currency or more even, since a camry cost 140,000, a typical manager in a small company takes home about 5,000 a month. not trying to bitch about it, but just putting it out there that there are shittier markets out there
buy the car a year old when someone else has taken the biggest depreciation hit, sell it at about 4 years old while it’s still worth something and is reasonably unlikely to break. about the best balance you can find with modern cars, i think, long term ownership is too risky now.
i always thought that having the touch screens would not be very safe. i thought this would be as distracting as texting while driving. i think it should be a law that you can only restaurant search or any thing else with the touch screen if you pull over to use the touch screen.
i drive a 1994 ford f-150 with a 351 small block windsor truck has 224,000 miles on it all i've done is change check the oil and put spark plugs in it. and im really ocd about it so always keep it super clean i even wax it in the summer. guys try and buy my truck it seems weekly.
in your video you said it. manufacturers don't want you to keep your vehicle long term. they want you to. upgrade every 5 years max. only a few companies chrysler included guarante parts support up to 10 years. so really going forward it will be hard to keep vehicles a long time.
there's a physical switch for that. it's not the coolest but it works and will probably continue to work for many years to come. manufacturers are commonly criticized for using parts bin controls but for the most part they work and don't require a software update to stay working.
you bought a shitty hyundai that despite costing less initially will have far more cost over the life of the car and you're crying about cost. i have a camry 2010 hybrid with 480000km and my costs have been incredibly low with only wear and tear on the suspension being a problem.
i have to agree with this video, my past two cars have so many buttons and features that i don't even use. looking up the cost of repairing everything these buttons do it is mind blowing. that is why i now drive a 2004 vauxhall astra, goes from a-b plus i can add things if i want.
seems like a ton of old boring people here. i love my car and i love all the tech in it. that's why i lease just look on youtube. there are a ton of people in their 20's having sweet rides and honestly we love this shit. we have one life, why not do things to make ourselves happy?
the biggest problem is that douchebags like you are trying to get the money for the same cars they talk about via the obnoxious stupid bias inaccurate videos hoping to get enough views,subs and whatnot to get some money for car buy off of the youtube instead of working hard for it
i'm so disappointed to only recently finding this channel. your work is brilliant. the coverage and bringing it to a shop etc is original, informative and humerus. i agree with you points here, especially the lack of support. by the way, with your voice you could be a psychiatrist.
in the 2017 ford escape, i have zero problem telling the info system to find a place to eat or a gas station because it is 'now' the top of the line when it comes to touchscreen tech. this video is for idiots who likes to listen to people complain about everything but not one thing
that is my biggest problem with new cars. the touch screen. just watching him try to change the climate controls on that touch screen and having it lag so bad. it would drive me crazy. ok a touch screen stereo is fine, but the climate control needs to be physical buttons and knobs.
you bitch about safety systems, but then admit you rear-ended someone. you're trying to play both sides of the field, and people see right through it--i've rarely seen such a disparity between likes to dislikes on the videos i watch. like, i don't even know what your angle is here.
good points. however, many of these complicated systems are now mandated such as traction control, abs, air bags. tightening fuel economy and collision standards will always evolve towards increasing technology. so which manufacturer will begin to simplify and de-content their cars?
meh. yeah the tech is expensive replacing right after its new. but the market always finds people either making replacement pieces or refurbishing components in 6 -10 years. i do agree with initial cost as being a first owner is a insane proposition. i always buy used and save 50 %.
old car always comes with low mpg which also considered a big cost. modern cars integrated technology stuff which cost a great deal labor to manufacture also have its price upgraded. however, it comes with better safety and longer endurance. how could you say it worse than old cars?
this is nothing new that's why i even when it comes to car audio the germans years ago start selling sound processors that would hook right up to your stock head unit and get a good clean signal out of it so you wouldn't have to replace the head unit and still get good quality sound
this is so true, and the part about the infotainment systems being a complete scam is even more true. most of these systems dont cost more than 3 to 400 dollars and if you get them as an option in the car they charge you fucking 1000 or more for em. get the fuck out of here will ya?
totally agree with everything you say. that’s why i have always bought the base models of newer cars because most of the time the parts used are way cheaper when it comes to repairs. come on people, sometimes what looks great isn’t really all that it’s cracked up to be. simple smart
abs gave a problem two years ago and just disabled it just to take out the control relays. later on i found the toothed ring around my drive shaft snapped. ordered a second hand drive shaft and build it in. just plugged back the relays and it worked again. try that with a modern car.
absolutely agree. an automobile should be a sacred platform free of the software trends of the day. imagine if your otherwise-usable mid-1990s vehicle was stuck with trendy mid-1990s software governing so much of the experience. the only way to win that game is to not play it at all.
as someone who drives delivery-vehicles for a living i'll accept sensors that tell me when liquid levels are getting low, that's convenient. i'll accept buttons on the steering wheel so i can safely operate the radio while driving. reversing cameras and parking sensors are fantastic!
honestly my biggest gripe with the new cars is what you were talking about with infotainment systems. even cars that are new some of their ui look outdated. thats why i think carplay is a good idea because you make the screen just that. a screen for your phone to do the infotainment.
i just went through this exercise. i purchased a new, 2018 kia soul base. it was the least expensive new car i could find save the mirage and spark. final price was $14,600 and i had a trade that was worth $2600. so 12k minus fees and taxes. the car has no extras, which is just fine.
i watched a video the other day where they were driving a bugatti veyron.it left them stranded.the computer got confused and locked up the tranny and messed up the engine timing.none of those so called super cars are reliable enough to drive through town without a car hauler on call.
i’ve had good luck with used in the past, but that’s an important question to always consider when buying used. that said. i bought a base level car prius, higher trim levels didn’t offer much bang for the buck. some of it would be awesome to have but not at almost doubling the cost.
lol. im 47 and still never buy a new car. i always get a good second hand for $3500-$4500. my cost per month over 20yrs doing this is $85-$100 not including gas or oil changes etc. just cost of car and repairs.i've gone through 5. on my 6th car. subaru outback is my preferred choice.
very seldom, and only when parked in a parking lot or driveway. problem solved. also, something i've noticed, but most of this tech crap come from higher model cars. buy the base model car instead, it has the same engine, transmission, ect. you don't need all that fancy crap anyways.
don't finance or even worse, lease a vehicle. buy what you can afford with cash. then save for a better vehicle if you wish, which should be possible because you are making no payments. your future financially secure self will thank you for having made the wise decision to avoid debt.
however, everyone wants junk with touch screens. i find it funny how the guys who review the new e-class knock it for not having a touch screen. that's probably the most absurd thing i've ever heard. hey, let's knock this car for doing something smart that keeps your eyes on the road!
i hate the concept of touchscreen in cars. it is sooo horrible. they design those integrated phone call systems in cars to keep you away from phone while driving. and so hugely contradictory to that,they put a huge ass touch screen to control 80%of the car from it. how stupid is that!
only tech i want in my car besides anything that makes it faster is a nice sound system with analog controls. if i could have everything thats electronic in my car like power windows and what not changed to its older manual counterpart i would, but like you said they wanna make money.
great review and so true. i love my toyota taco with manual roll up windows, nice dials for adjusting the temp or sound etc. i compare that to my sube where the electric switch for the seat went out and it cost me $350.00 bucks to fix. god forbid how much a car touch screen would cost.
i can think of one without even watching any of this video is they put way too much plastic as part of sensors and other computer components all throughout the motor transmission radiator power steering tires it's all around the vehicle so it's designed break right out the factory door
my wife has a 2014 rav4 xle, near top model was only $27k. i have a 2016 rs2 edition 86. msrp was $31k, and got them down to $26k. maybe its difficult to own a brand new car if you work at mcdonald's thats why you get an education. also, thats why you should be a dual income household.
the finance cost point was ridiculous. as a software engineer information security professional in my early 20s, i have no issues affording nice vehicles. please don't pollute the minds of our youth with these disillusioned thoughts. you don't even need a college degree for this field!
but i also appreciate my 2012 mustang or better yet my 2015 malibu lt full of technology. it makes life easier, and i am assured that if shit hits the fan i can pretty much with modern technology odbii dongle and a phone diagnose my problem and tell the mechanic this is what it's doing!
i liked your video until you needlessly injected politics into it. car manufacturers are putting those systems in because that is what people are wanting and expecting now. my 2005 mercedes has a wayyyyy outdated touchscreen and i still find it to be useful and elegant. you're a douche.
my mother bought this ford explorer. after about half a month the computer just died, it wouldn't even start. the simple solution is buy a saturn or some sort of car from that time period or older. there isvless crap and if they still work today then they are probably reliable long term
new cars are a mega-scam i'm so glad i have the mental resources to daily-drive and maintain a 45 yr old car while my computerized pos truck sits in disgrace. costs very little to run, insurance is all of $150 a yr. stuff your keyless wifi throwaway jellybeans where the sun don't shine!
one thing i really can't believe is that pretty much all cars with touchscreens lags like its an iphone 2. it just blows my mind how they cant implement something thats fluid like all fucking phones and tablets these days. it looks bad and it's pretty embarrassing if the car costs 50k +
phone better than navigation. more important no maintenance, brake pads, oil changes, expensive gas. most people don't drive more than 40 miles a day. $5-10k used 80 mile electric cars leaf smart spark focus do the job. quick charge map app www.plugshare.com clean, fast, domestic power.
the truth, and nothing but the truth, so help us god. i love my e class and i love my cadillac, but good thing i’ve kept my 1982 chevy caprice in perfect shape, just in case, good video, realistic, cheers. you sound like the voltaire of the 21st century and copernicus before the church.
there is no need to update software in a proprietary software eco-system like a car, if the software works flawlessly for the application it was designed for. you do not ask for a software update for your digital weather station, your microwave or a pocket calculator either, or do you?!
today's machines dwarf anything a decade ago. when i see how an old window-rattling mach i costs more than the latest automotive marvel, i marvel. those old cars are so sloppy. the only one i would put up with is the old e-type jag. enzo had it right the most beautiful car in the world.
very correct,too much gizmos and too big a price. plus long term reliability isn’t a concern for manufacturers. hell,look at the 2018 mustangs,they have tons of electronics to change suspension settings,the displays,and the manual transmissions are breaking shift forks after 1500 miles!
yeah dude it's depressing. i'm fortunate enough to afford two new vehicles and i thought they were the answer to not wanting to fix my crap anymore. but come to find out, they're going in for warranty work with less than 18,000 and 4,500 miles. my warrantyless future scares me to death.
and yeah, i just bought a used stereo head unit for $20 and it does the basics radio, cd, and aux just fine, and will always do, and for the rest i can have a phone assist me with the latest gps data, without paying thousands for a crappy outdated android tablet with a shitty skin on it.
five things i don't like about modern cars. 1 most of the vehicles have automatic transmission, now you see rarely a brand new car with manual transmission. 2 the cost of owning one. 3 costly to repair. 4 useless technology that really makes people dumber. 5 hybrid and electric vehicles.
honestly we should be pushing for laws that force manufacturers to pus sensors in passenger seats that detect whether or not ther is a passenger and if there isn't one the touchscreen should not allow you watch videos, use yelp or anything the requires a lot of focus outside of maps ofc.
i drive a fully restored 1991 mercedes 300se. this car was the last generation hand built cars by mb. it has a real wood panel interior, not plastic. real chrome on the bumpers. i must admit the ride is not that of a 2016 full size car, but with 250,000 miles and still running, i'm happy
i like technology. people sometimes forget that the tech is sometimes the greatest part about a modern car, the gtr and focus rs being prime examples. even many high power bmws have trick electronic rear diffs that give them amazing handling. now are those cars gonna be expensive to fix?
i never bough at new car all my life second hand cars. i also learned to work on my own cars. you can get so much information off the internet and you tube so you can work on your own cars. i also did not buy complicated cars with lots of gadgets. they do sell simple cars less pricey to.
really nothing major, feels like the same car. it even looks very similar. at one point in time, people used to identify themselves with their cars, and it represented their character in a way. nowadays, its just a wealth status to show everyone off. i always wonder why people buy suv's?
the biggest problem with modern cars is pretty much everything the harder to work on the more expensive there's more moving parts because everything is power nowadays everything cost more to fix all the emission control b*******sensors and everything else it's just one more thing to fail
there is no logic used in his comments, just a lot of being disgruntled that life didn't turn out in the way he mistakenly thought it would. who in their right mind goes into a car dealership with an honest intent to buy and doesn't even know the estimated price of a vehicle in question?
your hand book will say dealer only ,bollox trans fluid says mfg only bollox again ,renault want appx £60 for their fluid i checked the spec and found one for just under £30 for 5ltrs flushed the unit out [they said dont do that ] filled to the correct level and bingo drives really nice!
a lot of repairs costs can be lowered by just doing it yourself. like i recently changed out my ball joints on my old truck, it would have cost somewhere around $400 for just 2 joints on one side, but i did it myself and it was around $40 for parts $20 each, that's a stupid cost in labor!
alot of new cars now lack character or driving characteristics and are practically falling apart from the dealership they are almost made disposable all generic expensive junk riddled with electrical faults and shonky driver aids. im not paying more for aids when you can get that for free
as far as cellphone and update. that's why i rooted my galaxy s5 with lineage os. even with being able to mess with tune the cpu and gpu plus all the freedom and security options, it's starting show it's age. but i will be able to hold out till the s10 or note10, vs upgrading once a year.
it's reliable, cheap to maintain, and it's gr8 on gas. the 1 i use to have handled great on ice, could easily hit its top speed of about 120mph, got about 34mpg, and a replacement motor could be as cheap as $300 bucks. how much does it cost you to replace a coil pack in your modern car???
look how f**king bad the touch system is, ignoring touches. 10fps lag. to put ipads in to cars should be ilegal. it force you to look away from the road to look at the screen to do simple tasks like turn heat or cold on the ac. this shall be used by knobs so you can feel what youre doing.
maintenance costs. these days regular servicing is every 12 months as opposed to the 6 months of older cars, and, well, i have a 2009 ford mondeo in the us a fusion and in the 3 years that i've had it bought second hand of course i've only ever had to pay for regular servicing touch wood!
technology is great but car manufacturers should know what to make a physical button for and what to put in a display sure the gps the cd player the radio put it in a screen but some cars just take it to te next level of dangerous like tesla like why would you have the ac a center screen?
they're building for the people who buy or lease the new models and since they'll only have it during the warranty period they would rather have the fancy tech. it's a lousy situation for those of us who like to keep cars long-term and or buy second hand but i don't know how to change it.
also most support pretty decent voice control options. but by all means stay stuck in the 80ts or 70ts i am glad we have this kind of tech and options available. it's not like you have to use your infotainment system in mid cruise to do something special aside from changing a song or two!?
dont need all that shit in a car like the touch screen climate controls what the fuck. i mean cars are just supposed to be driven and not lived in and be another phone, computer, and distraction. just another reason why i will always just look for and buy decent to good bargain owned cars.
i hate new cars. all touchscreens, have to change the climate control because i have to sort through 3 pages of shit to find climate control, meanwhile on my shitty forfour, i reach for the knob and crank it 4 degrees. boom. i got cold hot air. takes 1 second. dont even have to look at it.
less that can go bust is more money in your pocket get a basic robust longlife jeep, defender, toyota landcruiser hilux, chevy blazer lada taiga, suzuki jeep and keep it up running and learn to repair it yourself you will find joy in it. my first car cost 350 euro and it drove for 4 years.
nope. not compatible with my model. but when my radio went out the gave me a new model radio and loaded the old firmware and os cause i have a 2013, they will not update it to the latest version. said, like the new stuff buy a 2015 to get the new infotainment, yeah, no. absolute bull shit!
this is stupid. its just your opinion. reason why ther3 are so many tech in a car is becuz of demand. parts cost so much because its a new car, duh. ppl are also getting payed more and are getting richer these days. many can afford new cars. just because you cant doesnt mean new car sucks.
but it seams every other week someone tries to merge without looking, or runs a stop sign, or is tailgating me when i am already in the slow lane. i'm sure it is only a matter of time before i get hit by one of them, and i'd rather have a car with airbags and proper crumple zones when i do.
issues are they are overpriced for something many don't want. i don't need a back up camera, leather heated seats, bluetoothradio. if i want that crap i will take it to a radio shop and have those things installed. not dropping more than 10k for a car. not dropping more than 30k for a truck
on the price point, i make good money and a new car costs about a year of my salary before taxes and living expenses. after those are taken away, i'm looking at a year and a half to two years for something with less power than an old fc and less carrying capacity than my dad's 1985 saab 900
so there is a point to be made. that cars built 50 years ago, like say a 66 chevy impala will still be running if there is gasoline for it, in the next 50 years. but a car built today, in 50 years will be a hopeless relic, loaded with hopelessly out of date electronics that cannot be fixed!
technology is nice while it works. but when that time comes, and things start braking. large bills come out of someone's pocket. and yes, the government should make the law that car manufacturers must keep improving and developing software for cars sold at least 8 years after the sale date!
the living standard has gone down so far in america and yet people still think america is the greatest. i can tell you europeans live so much better than americans, it's like night and day. my car is now 7 years old, still beautiful, low maintenance, no problems with my 2010 italian lancia.
i have often wondered about playing with a touch screen while trying to drive. the thing about updating software doesn't bother me really -- the only reason why i get a new cell phone is because they die some horrible death. otherwise, for calling and texting any random phone is good enough.
yes, they are. but that's not new. like every consumer product, they track inflation. but i'll argue that you can actually get cars cheaper today, after accounting for inflation, with much higher quality, than you could have in the 80's or 90's, as an example. are they expensive to maintain?
i rent a lot of cars for long trips and find the techno shit useless from the get-go. i can just imagine what a pain in the ass these cars will be when the rental company eventually sells them off to refresh their fleet. there will be a lot of really sad buyers with broken bells and whistles.
im on board with these. i really have no desire to have these safety hand holding devices in my car just to break. how about we invest more in our driving skill in america instead of relying on a fucking sensor to save our asses. pass a test and a 15 min driving exam and youre good to go, bro
my man stop you winning, get a used car the cars now last 300,000 miles when you do scheduled maintenance. why the hell you think people are driving 11 1 2 year old cars, because they last longer than they used to. anyway your generation are the ones that came up with all this high-tech crap!
okay, that was the most pointless example i've ever heard. everything you said here made little sense. and mind you, i'm huge car guy that loves old fashioned cars. yes, you have to take your hand out of your steering wheel to interact with the screen. so would you rather use a phone instead?
that is a solid family car for 15k in both us and eu. hyunday make solid cheap cars but that name is for the poor in the us i guess. so to be honest the fault is with the buyers in america. if you go for a 40k car and complain you cannot afford it don't blame the dealers. the market provides.
this is such crybaby bullshit. there are still base model cars without tons of techno bs. there is an outstanding used and pre owned market for cars. if people aren't smart enough to do research and find a good car that fits their budget and lifestyle thats their problem not the manufacturer.
you could say that the car market is the new financial bubble like the housing crisis back in 2008 except worse. at least a home is an investment, it's amazing how many people are in debt overs cars they can't afford all because these banks and car dealers approve anyone for a loan. 0 credit?
agree with you, software is still shit in 99% of the cars and will never be updated. in some point of the future, where software will dominate over the hardware, it will be updates. in the meentime, we need to hack that infotament systems to get what we need. in most of the cars, its hopeless.
either they're not going to be able to afford it, or they are going to go into debt to fix it. that is not two different things. if you borrow the money you cannot afford it. aside from that fallacy everything else you mentioned should be obvious. the sad thing is that to most people it isn't.
i'm 70 and in the trap of trading off my truck as soon as the warranty is running out because when you live on the old age pension you can't afford any nasty surprises at the repair shop so you always want your vehicle to have warranty. most practical car ever made 1982 chev impala with a 350!
living in saskatchewan. cities are so spread apart that everyone absolutely needs a vehicle as soon as they turn 16. and cars need to be expensive enough to last long trips reliably. so when you're 16 you need to drop at least 6 grand. and if you don't have rich parents this is hard to acquire
most of this tech you speak of is optional equipement on most vehicles which means the buyer chooses it. you can still buy base model cars. as far as safety features, those are mandated by federal gorverment. no different than gorverment mandated seatbelts required in all vehicles decades ago.
please don't start arguing about changes only because you dont like them. i think the viedeo should contain suggestions, how the problems could be solved. try to think further look for alternatives for your car bike, train, public transport, walking and try to make the best out of a situation.
yeah i've always question even the fancy keys. no more getting a duplicate for $10, $20 or $100. like he's stating in 5yrs u buy this pre owned car & in 2yrs when the system screws up i can imagine what it's gonna cost. computers aren't that expensive but u can bet the 1 in your car shall be@!
you said it very very well. how about this i inhearted a car from my mom. the heater controls are flat buttons. i cant feel them with my fingers. i have to look at them to use them. my gf says i need heat. i say back wait a sec i have to wait till the traffic clears so i can look at the panel.
good video, but i would like to point of a few things 1. $42,000 is a bit unrealistic for young adults barely going into society. and most of those people would probably end up getting used cars for far more cheaper than this. if one can't afford an used and old $1000 car, get a job, seriously.
i kinda agree except with the anticapitalist view. mostly manufacturers will have to compete to gain attention and most people dont consider what you discuss here when buying. for me the best era was from 80s to 2005 or so. fuel injection and tecnology where you needed it, i hate keyless entry.
steering wheel, three pedals, a manual gearbox, a gauge cluster and ac heater for warm and cold days. that's really all i need in my car. i don't even want or use the radio in my car. i drive some new upper class cars occasionally and they all have something in common they are annoying as hell!
you complain about the negative effects of capitalism and i have yet to found any good point to our modern, money based society but sill you accept capitalist without any problems and actually defend it. this is the exact reason why this world is shit, because people accept this kind of things.
buy a car without a touch screen and all the fancy tech. then if you decide you want to add a touch screen buy one aftermarket and install it. this solves one of the issues, also we all like shiny and new cars. i think people are just so brain washed into thinking new is always better. not true.
fuck out of here with this expensive bullshit. if you're struggling financially, dont buy a new car. new cars have literally always been expensive. trust me, i fucking hate push button start, digital gauges, digital replacements for interior controls, and all the bullshit plastic, but seriously?
i think the only thing you need in a car is bluetooth and backup cameras. people shouldn’t need 360 cameras, side mirrors detection, heads up display, etc. it’s all a distraction. so i say put your phone down, get rid for the extra tech and start enjoying the car you payed 10’s of thousands for.
the best things in life are free but you can't reach them without a car. sadly the new generation will have bike-share, car-share, house-share and even food-share. my parents owned 3 homes and 3 cars and a boat. i can only afford one house and two vehicles. now the new gen can't afford anything.
watching videos like this makes me hold onto my 2008 toyota corolla for as long as possible until the engine dies out fuck all this new expensive scamming bull shit only got 103,000 on her and guarentee she will last 300 to 400,000 miles so that being said i ll hold on to my wonderful 08 corolla
when i took my drivers license i drove 2017 volvo and it was so frustrating to drive it and i hated this push to start crap, the only good thing was reverse camera but that shit is easy to install on a old car so i don't get it why you want a modern car. i drive a vw golf 03 stick and i love it!
as an engineer, i figure this has a lot to do corporate interference and marketing. it seems they don't carefully design a lot of modern cars, and make maintenance harder because cars have high turnover rates. idk, i'm just guessing but engineers know these designs are pretty ridiculous at times.
i agree, with everything you said. but, i disagree, with you driving and looking to far over to your right to see the camera. at least put it in the front screen or park and talk. that is just as bad as people holding a cell phone up to their ear. otherwise, great video and great info. thanks jim
i saw that all the time doing welding in alberta. guys buy some $40,000 or more truck and then either get laid off or can't find a new site and then comes the panic selling because none of them could deal with the big purchases. made me feel smug getting around in the $1000 car i had at the time.
my car costed 38.000 euro, but i did not go to university nor have massive loans and debt. started working at the age of 19 years old, lived with my parents for a while. after a few years i already have gotten a raise or two. now i have my own house and car paid off without any debt at age of 33.
the infotainment system with every essential task built into it is a real problem. controlling the ac heat radio volume should all be completed through analog. if it’s 10 degrees outside and your interface suddenly takes a poop, you’re screwed and will be completely obligated to replace the item.
cell phone comparison is perfect example why to not update the software. constant upgrades on phones make them less and less usable as the software is expecting better cell phone hardware. i am experiencing that with my phone after 1.5 years with upgrades on key software slowly crippling my phone.
consumerism is only as bad as the consumer. if the consumer is lazy and wants instant gratification, then the market will provide him with what he wants just to make a profit, but technology itself can never keep up with their demands and needs. who in their sane mind would use apps while driving?
i would suggest early '90's japanese, '60's 'murican. these would still allow for upgrades such as brakes, etc. and it seems you could get into these for less than the price of a new car. and, at still obtain a higher residual value, whilst have a fun, decent car for day to day use. your thoughts?
my youngest car is an 07 xlr, the screen now looks old and i never use the nav i also have an 04 crossfire manual, and an 05 srx v8. i dont like the new tec and hate that most of the screens now like an afterthought sticking out of the dash. i dont see myself with a new car for many years to come.
tell me about, i've owned a chrysler lhs, 540i, 328is, and 135i. all of the bmws are constantly in the shop, the chrysler limped along with 2yr oil changes and severe crash damage and kept chugging until it was so messed up it was crushed, although it drove onto into the wrecker itself with pride!
that is mainly because the us market demands very large premium cars. look at other markets, the most common car in the uk is the ford fiesta. in japan they have their kei cars. if the us drove what the rest of the world is driving, it would be around 10-15k for a new and simple family car on avg.
wow best video i've seen on modern cars. i'll never ever buy a car without manual controls or with a gps, unless i put it there. never have, never will. oh yeah and will never spend more than $12k sticker price. capitalism is evil because the people who run it are evil, or maybe they're both evil.
i like watching the savagegeese, but this is hypocritical. the savagegeese has a bmw m3 and his mechanic buddy drives a porsche. here's my advise. buy a cpo. i have a 2013 a5. maintenance package and extended warranty came with it. don't buy a new car. period. oh by the way i am from illinois also.
i personally drive a 20 year old motor and have thought these exact thoughts for ever. the more stuff on the modern car equals the more to go wrong. i'm sure sensers etcetera are actually designed to fail for commercial gain. no i'm going to stick with the nuts and bolts of my old reliable trooper.
i'm glad someone finally made a video about this. especially the affordability or lack thereof, of todays cars. theres a huge and cruel irony, with regard to the longevity of the built in tech. people will eventually stop buying second hand cars for fear of the repair bills for the technology, but!
instead of going through 300 dollars worth of underwear shitting yourself because of the $42,000 car that your mistress wants, maybe a person should save that money for the wife's or mistresses' kids education. do american guys really expect to be able to all afford mistresses in their 20s and 30s?
ladies and gentlemen, i bought a 1988 toyota corolla hatchback, 127500 km for 1300 € and repaired it for 3000 €. that means to a full body, engine and chassis functionality. in three years it is also eligible for the museum register, where the tax is negligible and 30 driving days allowed per year.
totally agree on #1 maybe it is my age, but i find many current cars to be completely forgettable and non-descript anyway, so why not buy a 10-15 year old car and get a bit in to doing maintenance yourself. don't really agree, or maybe care about #2 though what's with all this multi-media nonsense?
we need cars that are as basic as possible with safety, economy and reliability. mechanical controls for a c,vent, & heat. crank handle windows. those power window regulators are ridiculously expensive plus the labor cost to replace them. want the simplicity of a 60's model car with today's safety.
the biggest design flaw with integrating everything into one big touchscreen is the loss of haptic feed. i've driven the t90d and when you do 60 mph, you want to touch the buttons. to feel them without taking eyes off the road. it's not happening with touchscreen design approach, and it's dangerous.
the other day my battery died in my 2014 chevy silverado. i tried to replace the battery like i've done plenty of times on other vehicles but not this time. couldn't get to the damn battery due to all the other components in the way. i'm an engineer and i'll be building my next truck. you should too
i am seeing this video by accident. quite interesting that i came up with my thoughts about opportunities of less gizmos in niche marketing for discerning car manufacturers in my just published book on amazon. under a chapter on technology. that's unnecessary gizmos in recent cars what a coincidence?
lol this comment section. have fun driving your '90s-'00s death trap car. like it or not, if you want safe you buy late model. old cars are not safe. safer relative to cars that came before them but i'll take the 2016 or 2017 over a big '90s car. anyone who would take the big car because it's bigger!
modern cars are not made to be maintained. they are made to alive warranty and make profit for those who make them. we live in i only i now world. you are supposed to get a new one after 3 years end of lease and let some sucker try to maintain it only to try to sell it with huge price loss year later
no, don't buy a diesel, no no, they're polluting the environment. buy petrol, oh, no, electric, buy electric, we'll help with the cost of purchase. scary, how could anyone buy a modern car when it will be old tech in no time at all. it's probably the worst period for forecasting car sales in history!
cars cost so much because of government regulation. emission controls, tire pressure sensors, required safety features, etc. manufacturers are forced to add features, and we are forced to buy them, and history shows that involuntary exchange is theft. what exactly is the government stealing this time?
i love my new tuscon has the 3 knob heating system. my fusion has 7 speed fan. a knob that goes up by half a degree for temp and pass temp crap. just so many buttons. i just want the heat air on or off. don't get started on the radio. i've never been a fan of steering wheel controls except for cruise.
i own a 2014 cadillac cts and it has all the tech stuff. you make a good point. it took me 25 years to be able to get a car like that, and there too, you made a good point. i hope they come out with a way to update the car without having to finance that too in the future. it is a very nice car though.
i think the biggest problem with modern cars is that there are too goddamned many of them. i can't drive anywhere anymore without getting stuck behind some slow motherfucker who i can't pass because there are other slow motherfuckers in the other lanes as well. slow motherfuckers belong on city buses.
these days if you want to drive a new car, just lease it. the benefit of lease is that the company gets the cars way cheaper than a retail buyer. this cheaper price benefits the lease company and you.you drive new, no huge downpayment, no additionalunexpected repair bills. montly costs known up front.
this is why i'm a huge hyundai kia advocate now. great new cars, competitively priced. reliable and longest standard warranty 5 60k b2b covers all that tech and 10 100k engine and transmission. used to be a korean car hater but not anymore after i bought my loaded sedona sx. it's been reliable so far.
don't know why they ever added a c. it just breaks and costs money. but seriously you're supposed to pull over to use the center console apps like yelp or have a passenger do it if you have one. it's really quite simple. my phone is 5 years old. does everything a modern phone does, but slightly slower.
i drive a 1968 volvo 122s. no electronic shit. when it doesn't run, which is very rare, i can fix it myself. people are now at the mercy of a repair shop to have their car repaired. there are way to many computer parts on cars made today. when they quit they have to be put on a machine for a diagnosis.
that's why i like the brz, the touch screen has nothing to do with the climate control, the touch screen is only for music and navigation, no apps. regular old guage clusters, sure it does have push button and keyless entry, but it is seemless and doesn't get in the way of using the car what it is for.
there's gonna be a market for bad ass bootleg software that you can load on your used car in about 5 years. you'll have to buy it from some stranger on some honda forum that calls himself $$$ but that software will be twice as fast as original and only crash when in the proximity of a bluetooth signal.
anti crash technology so people can text while they drive better. no officer i wasn't texting, i swear it was a low flying ufo or maybe a flock of geese that distracted me. really they say i have a rock solid wait wow look at the pretty squirrel, ok where were we, oh ya an extremely high attention span.
excellent points and excellent video. the cost thing i'm aware of and no matter how cool the new audis or bmw or even a focus rs is, the prices are insane. the software update thing is something i hand't thought about but it's on my radar now, specially since i'm looking to buy a car sometime next year.
i wished they made the consoles without those bloody proprietary touch screens with closed system software. just give me a place to plug in my ipad. it's a lot cheaper to buy a new ipad than to get new upgraded components for the car console. oh, and keep the mechanical buttons for the air conditioning!
i've driven nothing but older cars with no screens or sensors or anything, and i could honestly care less about all this technlogical mumbo jumbo. if you need to have thousands of dollars worth of shit to stay in your lane, change lanes, and back up your car, you shouldn't be driving in the first place.
meh. i don’t think so. in the 1990s, family haulers were expensive too. if you got an suv with 4wd and a 200+ hp engine, like a jeep grand cherokee, it was $40k. more thrifty people went with a dodge caravan. and you can do the same thing today. as for tech. why would you need it to be updated in a car?
your first point is not unreasonable. but some modern cars, such as the prius, are extremely reliable and thus worth the cost, especially if you get them after they are 2-3 years old. the technology race is often bogus. but you as consumer can certainly avoid putting in distractions such as cell phones.
all tech is great. until it breaks. especially in car. that's why i dive chevrolet s10 blazer from 1994. it's big, it's fast enough, it's unbreakable like mercedes w124 and the most high-tech electronic thing in it is the radio that's using audio tapes and it has a monochromatic display. i love this car!
buying new is just a horrible concept and waste of money. there is no upside to buying new absolutely none. buy a beater for 500 bucks and it will last ya a year sometimes 5. tech is shit everyone knows it's not suppose to be in a vehicle. the military doesn't use it, no politician does, law enforcement?
while i agree with the major point regarding this video. it’s all in what an individual wants to spend their money on. obviously the maker of this video doesn’t like spending his money on a car. fair enough. hell i paid cash for a brand new wrangler at 29. apparently he studied the wrong thing in college
as a lifetime mechanic i have driven almost every model made from the 1920's to today. to me the biggest problem is the fact that they started putting touch screens and such so that you have to take your eye off the road to make changes to the radio, a c, etc. it's no different than texting while driving.
cats are safer than ever, with or without the complex safety systems. crumple zones, better metallurgy, stronger frames, more aerodynamic, and higher belt lines. sure, your 70s car is nice and reliable. you would have a much higher likelihood of walking away from a wreck in a modern car than an older one.
i bought a 2015 mitsubishi mirage a couple years ago. it's a basic hatchback with a three-cylinder engine and a manual transmission. it gets right around 45 mpg regularly, and it cost $14k loaded, not a single problem with it in over 50k miles. why did i buy a car that professional reviewers hate so much?
i don't even know why my youtube keeps suggesting you. i don't like any of your videos, and i've seen more than i'd like to admit. you are far too negative about modern cars, but then say shit like we know technology is a good thing, we know that for a fact. do you just not think anyone should pay for it?
i'm from the uk and still run a 1997 peugeot idi turbo diesel i bought new. it's easy to service myself and never failed to start in over nineteen years. it's not quite as economical on fuel as a modern diesel car but has no drive by wire or bullshit sensor issues yet still returns over 50 mpg constantly.
savagegeese 10 year old nav. systems don't even allow you to program a destination when not at complete stop. the yelp restaurant app statement you made has to be false. i haven't looked it up yet, and this is an old video. but it would appear you just say things without knowing what you're talking about!
very good vid,new cars are no longer a cars,they are gadgets,and very complicated ones,if samething goes wrong and ownes income is low,then poor guy lady is sereously f@cked up,simple car from 90th for people like me low income is the best solution,it is ashame, what modern car production has turned into.
you might as well have titled this the biggest problem with buying a $1200 suit at barney's. take the train. take the bus. walk. bike. barely surviving. c'mon, man. i was 38 years old before i bought my first car. i biked. i walked. i took the train and the bus. i rented a car if i wanted to go somewhere.
you missed to mention how they are actually made these days. even the smallest contact with another object would lead to severe deformation of the metal parts or even the chassis which in many countries is a state beyond repair. in my work we have scrapped 3-4 months old cars because of structural damage.
i personally repair all of my cars and some of friends and i will never would buy something with computer, touch screen and other that sht, no to say about fully enclosed engine bay with 3 holes only, big no no. if it have minor problem in middle of nowhere where to look for nearest hacker to fix computer?
i think this applies most to trucks. there's a quite large used market for good quality cars like the volkswagen tiguan starts under 20 new and fiestas and stuff. trucks on the other hand are getting excruciatingly expensive and over luxurious, at the cost of eliminating lower trim levels and truck models.
let the dealer fix any issues under warranty, then get a new one when the lease is up. and if your on a budget, go certified pre-owned with a long warranty. it can sometimes be cheaper than owning some 2005 toyota with over 100k miles that keeps nickel and diming you on small repairs and cost of operation.
back in 2009 when i bought my first car ,i went to the dealership and asked how much does a sat nav entertament system cost for my behicle and they say about 1200 euros after about a month decided to install a car-pc that was more powerfull and it cost me 200euros for the lcd obd and gps module sooo get it?
did you know 10 years ago a ford f 150 takes 6 qt of oil 2018 the f 150 takes 8 qt of oil. the fu*kinh oil co tell the automotive companies how much oil the vehicle should take and if the automotive companies go by what the oil company says they get more senates that’s why i want a tesla. oil companies suck
in my country several cities are going to force us to buy more recent cars because they pollute less, all cars that are too old are not allowed in these cities, unless they pay a huge fee. so. throwing away your car and buying a new one every 3-5 years is more ecological than keeping an old one for decades?
my 2013 has a touch screen. it still works for now?, but it also has mechanical switches and dials as redundencies. i enjoy the car but it worries me. and it also has a turbo engine. wondering how that will last. my other car is a 2007 with almost no tech, no turbo. i really like cheap the simplicity of it.
the problem is no the cars, the problem is people, do not know how thing work, this guy complain of the new era of car, i like it very much, if you want nothing of this, then buy an old model, modern vehicles are like office for most people. so this is not a problem, is more like a dislike of new technology
this is why i stick with older cars. 90's, early 2000's but the simple, reliable ones. and if i want a touchscreen, camera, or remote starter then i install it myself. when that gets outdated or breaks, then i upgrade. no modules to go bad and stop your wipers, left rear tail lamp and ignition from working.
as a mechanic for 30 plus years gm tech i've made a boat load money fixing stupid things that engineers have designed into modern cars. if you want to drive space shuttle cars. you're going to pay high repair bills. mechanics have the best job today. the guy that posted this video is hundred percent correct.
i bought my 2000 camry new now 230,000 miles only scheduled service needed except i replaced the headlights $90 and a radiator $150 at 200k. it gets 27 mpg and it costs about 20 cents a mile including fuel and insurance to drive. people should read consumer reports and do some homework before they buy a car.
i keep thinking i'd be better off getting a 10 15 y o car for $5,000 $7000 more or less and putting $10k $15k into the drive train suspension with new or remanufactured parts. i know i can get a remanufactured engine and transmission for about $3k each with 7+ year warranty. am i crazy for thinking this way?
i've never been a fan of tech for the sake of tech. they wanna stick a computer chip into everything pisses me off, the biggest one to grind my gears is this idea that the steering wheel is no longer mechanically connected to the wheels, so now a computer which can and does break controls the steering lovely
my biggest problem is not the cost, even though i don't have any money. it's all the unnecessary gadgets, sensors, touchscreens and so on that i, first of all don't need, and secondly when any of that breaks, you are kind of screwed you can't usually fix it yourself and the cost of work + new parts is. yeah.
not that i agree with everything he said in this video but i totally agree with what he said about software update. it has been nearly 3 years since i bought my latest new car and it still hasn't received any software update. i guess currently tesla is the only one actively updates software in their vehicle.
since the super highway program which obviously a scam the big three proposed, the pandora's box is wide-open. of course, they will never see the success of public transportation could create other jobs and opportunities all we can do is sucking it up, it's karma. p. s. i moved to north america 20 years ago.
apple & google need to make a car, they would show other manufacturers how it’s done, and raise the bar for tech standards which include over the air updates new features. this would force other manufacturers to step their game up. right now there’s no good competition so we’re stuck with shitty tech in cars.
cars are better and safer with more features and they cost more. shame there's no cars anyone can buy new for less than half the $40k price tag you pulled outa yer ass. old cars where better, the infotainment never outdated my cell phone plugs right into a cassette adapter. when i was a kid things where good!
completely distracting. lanewatch doesn’t even activate in time for you to make your lane change, and carplay will only connect to a phone 10% of the time. waiting in a virtual line at honda to get this bullshit sorted out under warranty. only have 1,500 miles on the car so far. i like the sunroof. that’s it.
i own a 2002 saab 9-5 turbo. still faster than most cars on the road and it costs me about $250 maintenance and repairs per year, the car cost me $5,000 with only 60,000 miles on it 4 years ago. if it ever has any major problems i could afford to leave it on the side of the road and walk away with no regrets.
math is hard isn't it. $20k in 1990 i assume when you were a kid is $37k today. a cassette stereo option in 1990 cost the same as a modern nav system with dvd and sat radio. you can buy a car with manual controls for everything. they break also. but luckily in a free country, you can choose what car you want.
they did not have a bunch of gadgets that no one asked for in the first place, which ends up costing them more than they wanted when they get it back from the mechanic. sure they have are probably going to lots of miles, but as long as you are not thrashing it around 24 7, they will last you a very long time!
for out of warranty repairs, always look for salvage or rebuilt parts on ebay or from salvage businesses. a mechanic who is truly interested in helping you as a customer will search their salvage partners for costly parts. it does not make sense to put new parts on an old vehicle. you will save a lot of money.
i have never spent more than $7,000 on a car and that is my current one, which i plan on keeping until i am dead. oh sure, maybe i have to drop in a new engine in 20 years i only drive 4,000 miles a year it will still be much, much cheaper than a new car. i can live very nicely with my no loan payment vehicle.
i used to valet cars from around 2008-2010 as a second job. what i find interesting is the things that were in luxury cars at that time are in my base model carolla from 2015. i didn't want climate control, touch screens, cameras, or power anything but i didn't have a choice, it comes with the base models now.
it took until 5:30 for you to make your point that was obvious from the beginning. you're a piece of trash communist that wants others to pay for your shit. i agree cost is being driven out the roof by features, but there are enough people buying these cars for the manufactures to make money and employ people.
navigation $100 nuvi sticking on the windshield. sound system i pod feeding through a cassette adapter. accident avoidance air horn. anti theft device 6 speed manual shift with clutch. nobody can drive one stability control keep your damn foot off the gas. want something to turn heads, and catch everyones eye?
when i bought a 2015 i specifically went for something with all physical knobs, manual seats, etc. just bluetooth. mount your phone with a magnet. tada, you have music and navigation. bluetooth will be supported on phones well into the future. ever notice what a pita it is to use old touch screens on printers?
yes, a lot of tech comes default and more will over the years, if you don't want it, and want it upgraded, is afraid of it need to be repaired. see 1 you don't want it. if you don't like the functionality i.e. calculator on your smart phone. just use the phone part. you don't need upgrade for that part of it!?
and here i am. 21 years old, i had a 2001 silverado truck for about 3 years until the cost of keeping it running was going to be more than the truck itself i got it for 4k, and finally after hardwork while still in college, i was able to find a decent 1990 miata with only 67k miles on it for 6k. and guess what?
you lease the car because it's stupid to pay for something what value drops faster than you can pay for it secondly each car needs to have insurance, but if you take kasko insurance too, then each listed problem, wont be a problem anymore. secondly if you can't afford it, then you probably don't need it anyway.
i drive a 2004 civic. i drove my mom's car one time cuz my car was at the shop. the fucking break thing for the anti crash system just slammed on for no reason. i'm just sitting there like wtf stupid car, why did you break piece of shit, like, i can drive by my self. thank you car manufacturers but no thank you!
plus they all look the exactly same,imagination doesn't exist any more. all econ beans look the same. all pick ups look the same. all sedans look the same. all sports cars look the same. all super cars look the same. and lets not forget that crossovers are a thing and people actually feel good about buying them.
unfortunately, cars are emotional items to many people. and we know emotions don't write cheques instead they destroy wealth but equally provides a sense of fulfillment.worse, if you don't know what u want, everything will do and manufacturers understand this well that's how trends happen, life is about choices.
well just on what you would spend before you even pay on the actual note, you can get yourself a pretty decent car like what i drive, and just take care of things as they wear out, yea i got some things to do on mine, but when i add it all up, i will not even get to what sales taxes are going to be on a new one!
except the mute button. i just ignore them and drive the old way, like i did with my 1997 escort. #2 -- all that 'tech' stuff means you can't just go anywhere to get the vehicle serviced. there is so much wiring, digital sensors, and computerized junk, that only a microsoft-certified technician could do anything!
honestly, if you can't afford an expensive vehicle then by a cheap one, if you can afford an expensive one then buy what you want and learn to do repairs yourself to save money. i just bought my 2017 f-150 platinum and being someone that spends 9+ hours a day in my truck i do see a need to have a really nice one.
i'm better off getting a vintage car from salvage yard and have it restored. mechanic and you tuber scotty kilmer would also agree with you wholeheartedly when he did this video m5mhznjyiso about why he hates car parts made of plastic, especially in the engine. i'm sending your video to all my friends and family.
let me add some things to this. modern cars have super high sill lines and thick pillars. it may be safer in a crash, but it is much worse trying to see out of it whilst driving downtown. know how nerve racking it is to pull out of a parking space with all those blind spots, and people walking in the parking lot?
maintenance on old vehicles can be just as expensive. your issues are more economical rather than issues with the cars themselves. you spent a good 5 minutes pointing out how a young adult is expected to live and earn and how fast he she is put in debt with bills to pay. brand new cars have always been expensive.
my wife's still driving a lexus rx300 we bought new in 2003 and i've been reviewing new compact suv's to replace it with but i'm at the point now where i'm wondering if we can even deal with the tech overload, besides cameras and sensors all over the place does she really need an ipad sticking up out of the dash?
should be more worried about the fact that your countries education system is broken. tuition in america is ridiculous it costs 100 thousand plus to get a job that pays 40 thousand a year. thats why you cant afford a car. in canada i know 18 year olds that buy there own first car worth anywhere from 3-10 thousand
your infotainment breaks or is shitty, buy a pioneer with glass screen and yes can do your heating, dual zone, tire pressure. you need a 75 dollar dongle and presto. also pioneer has updates all the time also you can get the kenwood too. there are other expensive brands like clarion that offers even better sound!
respct from greece my friend in the bigining i said this guy tolk to much dut later when here your thots i said yes you have right modern cars are nice cars but lost maney. so i have a vw loupo 3litre diezel with no ac no electrik windos fucking empty i suposed i am happy oll i need is to be like scroutz mack dack
the sad thing is with reliable things the society won't accept you because you are than not modern with those things. for example beautyful girls want men with a modern mercedes-benz or bmw but the modern cars have problems and it goes deep into your pocket and if you lose anything so they will find other persons!
they still make gauges black so you can't read them in daylight. they keep making the doors smaller so even an average person has a difficult time getting in and out. they make room for engine components buy not room for the passengers inside the vehicle. the oil filter housing on toyota's is plastic, yes plastic!
and interest rates were a lot higher back then, too 15900&year1 2000&year2 2016 your example of '06 and '16 civics is bogus. a 10 yr old car has volume for replacement parts--much more than a brand new car. there are aftermarket replacements, there are junkyards. it's always been that way. and are newer cars safer?
holy crap. you just showed something from my local news. and the really screwed up thing is, i have friends that have had work done at that very shop where the stabbing happened. springdale, arkansas. and holy crap, you just hit the nail on the head about the issues with cars, i have been saying this for years now!
hon, you are so wrong. the first complaint should be levied against the economy, not the cars, and the second one is just all over the place. they don't let you look at yelp for instance while you're driving so they can add more components and ram the price up. ffs your not even supposed to use it whilst you drive!
i get only one. if i have to unlock the car manually from the passenger door, i can't. even right to this day, i'd rather drive a land rover, yes, the suv that is the british army's equivalent of the hummer. it's as simple as can possibly be and doesn't even have power door locks. unfortunately, they killed it off.
i paid 15grand for mine cash and so far it has worked out to cost me 40 grand just to run for 6 years and all i'm going to get back is 4 grand if i sell it, and thats if i'm lucky. now i'm looking at getting a ebike to save money. i worked out it should pay for itself after one year of riding if no longer own a car
if he's worried about the high cost of cars, why on earth is he looking at a brand new $30k+ suv. you can get a compact car with manual transmission for under $12k. even less if you buy used. some quick google searches on the nissan versa for example show a load of cheap parts online. $50 for a tail light, etc etc.
my biggest complaint with modern cars is the ridiculous amount of technology, most of which isn't needed. the entertainment screens, navigation, touch screens, etc., all are major failure points. none can be repaired by a home mechanic, other than possibly by replacing the entire unit such as navigation head unit .
the solution my friends is simple. don't bother to buy anything newer than about the year 2000, no, almost any modern car can be repaired, maintained assuming you don't wreck & wad it up into a ball, looking good as new for decades & half a million miles worth. if you the john q. public bothered to keep up with it.
touchscreens, autonomous driving aids, head up displays etc. etc. they can keep the lot for me. aircon, a great sounding stereo, satnav and automatic transmission and that about it. the rest is just stuff i'll never use. as regards the satnav the integrated systems are rubbish compared to good old fashioned tomtom.
capitalism can drive competitive pricing and innovation. it's government involvement that's the problem. automakers have so many regulations that they have to bow down to, that cars are now out of touch with what customers want. plus they've got to make their profit, so they've overpriced them with shiny technology.
go to a junkyard and see if they'll sell you a good board off a wrecked bonneville of the same year. no way to fix it, no way to update or replace the firmware or chipset. meanwhile, a college friend who collected old chevy ii novas and worked on them himself rarely had any problems once he got the old guys running.
i don't like infotainment screen that control everything like air conditioning, suspension, steering feel, etc. i was on holiday and i rent a peugeot 308. at some point i plugged my smartphone into the usb port and the screen just froze. i had do restart the car 4 times and after that finally the problem was solved.
i have a friend that started a car dealership at like 17, he's 18 now and we're both in college. the man makes bank out the ass but even he still looks at older cars. the car he drives now was one he and his did fixed up matter of fact. something about older cars that have a charm to them compared to today's models.
you can search for a restaurant while driving, that's not the cars problem, that's the drivers problem. this feature is meant to be used by your passenger or while you're parked, not while you're driving. an irresponsible person is gonna be irresponsible, regardles of whether or not he has a touch screen in his car.
i bought a new ish car and now all it's bells and whistles i find myself getting very distracted at inappropriate times. tech is good and bad depending on the user. i think ultimately there are a handful of actually useful tech in cars these days. the rest i agree is just an upsale on an already ridiculous price- tag
i couldn't agree with this more. i have a 1999 4runner, and i don't want a newer car. we had to replace the wifes car had a budget around $25k, looked at all the crap on the market. decided to get a 2015 subaru outback. the head unit is shit with there starlink crap but it looks like i can replace that in the future.
i have to thank you too for touching on a valid point that i've been voicing in my head and that you expressed in words millennials have the odds stacked against them with this rigged, unfair system. something needs to change. very depressing when you are just trying to make a decent living. keep pressing this issue!
perfect example. i was talking to a guy that had a 2000's hyundai manual and that costed him around 500 dollars to fix. for my 2010 nissan sentra manual it costed not double but 1300 dollars. yes cars are getting expensive. this is to fix the clutch and get the normal kit that you would get after about 100,000 miles.
well i'm on my very first car, 2002 honda civic lx, and i'm hoping that i can keep it for as long as possible. from the tone of the video, it seems we're all doomed as far as keeping cars for as long as possible. with that said, it makes me not want to buy any car post 2009 and stick to my civic for as long as i can.
yes. i have allways liked the feedback you get from physical buttons on your senter console you dont even have to look down there if you change your heater settings or when you want to adjust stereo volume etc. but in modern cars it is all touch screens so you have to look there to actually see what you are changing.
car prices are so much lower then they used to be. a nissan versa with an automatic transmission and the stuff we expect cruise, power windows and a radio all once options can be had new for $15k. there are third party high tech replacement systems for the led display unit, if that really was an issue, which it's not.
definitely agree. thanks for this video. the most annoying thing on the board are missing buttons. that's why i will be always looking for a car with real hw buttons at least for heating, fan, ac and so on. i do love my analog vw caddy petrol engine and try to keep it as long as it will be possible. - horrible response
i have 4 cars 12-14 years old and i dont plan 2 seld them. plan to keep them at least 10 years more. if i sell all 4 want buy me half off new car. and they have everything i need from car and are not expensive to repair. they dont have touch screens. so what. i dont need it. i can install for 60$ chines tablet with gps
i have a brand new car it has a stack of recalls.i can't even trade it in until i get the recalls adressed. with that said if you have excellent credit you can buy a new car without to much hassle.you should be around 3% apr. any more than that buy used. depending on your income expenses and credit a car is attainable.
i totally agree with you on this subject as i drive a citroen xm from the late 90's and it's so simple,so robust and definately the best ride for the driver and passengers. the running costs are minimal and many simple repairs i can do myself. the best part. wait for it i paid 500€ for it. which for you is around $581!
its the same mindset as well i put this safety net so that my kids don't fall off but without realising later on that one of his kid die by been stuck in it we want safer cars, its true but we don't want it at the cost of the most important part of driving which is awareness you take that away and you get into accident
touch screens suck. essential functions including all lighting, wipers, climate, cruise, and radio should be controlled with mechanical switches located so that the driver doesn't have to look away from the road. navigating through multiple screens of menus just to get to the function you need is a recipe for disaster.
was using a key to open the door or a mechanical lever to lock the door such a hardship that we needed electronic key ffobs and coded entry algorithims to save us from this energy-sapping threat to human existence. i think you will answer no to all this marketing bullshit. nevertheless, we do love our gadgets don't we?
we need more simple and cheap cars with the same build quality as any other and some basic safety but without any fancy features. we need cars that are built to last and that can be fixed easier and that won't rely on computers to work nor anything else that makes the car more expensive but not everyone needs in a car.
glad i have an 05 rav4 as a first car dirt cheap really nice. that'll probably still outlast a brand new 2018 car of any sort unless it's a truck like chevy, ford, or dodge. but when i do get myself a truck it'll most likely be a older model f-150 or silverado 1500 like the 97-03 f-150 crew cab or 06 or older silverado.
i own a 2014 bmw 116i sport and it's a good inbetween of technology and no technology. has plenty of physical buttons and dials for everything. but then it has a screen that you can watch dvds on while stationary, but can interact with physically and wonder through hundreds of menu options while driving. makes no sense!
9k millennial's that can't seem to come to grips that their era sucks including all the cars that are geared towards them. and isn't it comical that we now need all this shit to save them from themselves. just wait until these moronic manufacturers start forcing self driving cars that talk to each other down our throats!
great video. this exactly what i've been thinking. most people can't afford these overpriced cars. they're perpetuating bad financial decisions by making leasing appear affordable to sell more expensive vehicles. tech is great but think it's also a distraction when you're trying to focus on driving. love the safety tech.
i find the infotainment to be the biggest problem. toyota still uses their entune bullshit. honda and others use android auto but aa is just so half baked right and seriously needs more development. car makers still use low res shitty screens. time for them to amp shit up and give me a nice 10 display good for maps waze.
i need to get a job to be able to take care of my mom, and keep my job. i just need something cheap, reliable, and something i could fix my self. yet i know nothing about cars, today car's scare me, the financial expenses, safety, and reliability is a nightmare. i would like to buy a used, i do not know what to look for.
in regards to software updates on infotainment systems, or any car systems controlled by software for that matter, many vehicles' firmware can be updated over-the-air fota without you having to go to the dealership to get it updated. doesn't tesla and other major manufacturers do this already with proprietary technology?
low tension piston rings burns oil but good for advertising higher mpgs, lifetime sealed transmissions to save the dealership millions in both labor costs and fluid recycling costs, direct injection that raises mpg but kills it when carbon builds up on your intake valves say bye bye mpg and performance and or reliability
push button everything. battery fails nothing works. not even a neutral release. it's all push button. and if you had the push button parking brake on then thats also stuck. so it's either an extra bitch for the tow truck driver to work with. or it needs a roadside battery install just to figure out if thats the problem.
the only technology that give back your money is the fangtech technology cause you don't spend money to buy your fuel so your money is return to you, further more it is not that easy to give you trouble with your engine cause its cool. the fang can goes in the burning fuel technology, you will be satisfied with the fang.
i have a $70 000 kia sorento 2016 sx limited full house model and i'm 31. my car has automatic updates on the frimware. you just plug in a usb stick and it updates itself. have done it when i bought the car. it was on ver 1.1 and it updated to ver 3.5. i update every 6 months. so it depends on what make of car you go for.
i have a 2013 ford ranger. ford in their wisdom chose to try fuel saving by not letting the alternator charge all the time, in my first week of ownership i had to jumpstart it on several occasions. i returned to the dealership and they re programed the computer to change it back to a constant charge. no more flat battery.
if you have the money buy new, if not buy used, there is no problem with trying to make them save or that they are more expensive then used, its not some capitalist problem. for the yelp thing its your responsibility what you do with it, dont act like kids pretending that the car should police you when to use its features
just buy an nb miata. keep the oil fresh, keep wheels aligned, tires and breaks on it, change the clutch every 200k miles and you should be good. my first car is a 2000 miata. 17 year old, going on 18 year old car. to think i'm driving a car that was made when i was hardly one year of age, and it still runs, is fantastic.
or just buy a 5 speed 91 accord in great condition like i did, upgrade suspension and brakes, rebuild motor and you've got a comfortable car for 5 grand that'll last you 10 years. back up cameras and great sounding sound systems can be bought after market. there's no need to pay 40,000 for a car that'll only last 5 years.
thats why i love my bmw e46 3series no gimics no crap i can repair it on my driveway or change anythign i want on it with no problem. to me ill never buy a new car ill always go second hand oldschool. if i cant go down to the ice store and pic up a single or double din radio and do a quick swapp in my car i do not want it
whiny nonsense. cars have never been cheaper or better built. the cars i drove in the 70s were shit. compared to modern cars, they were rust buckets and absolute death traps if you crashed badly. a 10 year old car today would be safer, more reliable, and outperform and outlast the contraptions you get so misty eyed about.
and around $70 for the booth space would have been less but i they closed and i had to leave it over night so i saved almost $300 just by putting in some time. and don't say i don't know how to work on a car because i didn't know shit about ball joint replacement, so i watched a youtube video, they have them for everything
besides the infotainment systems my pet peeve is led lighting. i have no problem with led bulbs in sockets those work great, but instead clusters of leds that you have to replace as a unit. my son-in-laws 3rd brake light stopped working right. instead of a couple $1 bulbs, it cost us $70 for the part with a heavy discount!
had to subscribe after watching. can't say enough about this that is so correct. my tune up in my one recently obtained current weekend ride requires a timing light, my heater control never fails as long as my coolant is changed every 5 a years old. signed, old man driver ford small block windsor powered 92 foxbody mustang
it's like buying a bentley v12 and being surprised about the fuel consumption. if you want a low tec car, there are enough companies willing to sell you one. for example the renault dacia duster. or you can get many cars only equipped with the basics. and why do you dislike functions put into the cars infotainment so much?
most people have gotten so fooled into getting a new car in order to get 30 to 40 mpg that they don't think that even after the car or truck is paid for, the up keep on the car is totally ridiculous, and the prices this guy showed are only the little parts that it would take about 10 to 12 years to see that savings in gas!
whatever happened to just getting from point a to point b reliably and safely. too much tech in a car and you have all these people out there driving like idiots. i'll keep my car that has no touchscreen and none of the other so called safety features and driving assists that make everyone oblivious to what they are doing.
you can buy a modern car without all the sensors and stuff, or at least substantially dumb it down. no is making you buy $10,000 worth of safe and secure and led lighting packages. terrible video. you are complaining that the car buying public is not doing its homework and that it frequently makes poor financial decisions.
you know, you can still buy a pretty basic car or suv. you don't have to buy the tech packages. please stop whining. there are pulled by of sensible options out there. this video is really really really whiny. i'm trying to be polite. stop whining and make the right decisions for yourself and you won't have these problems.
100% agree, hate all the controls tied into the touch screen like with fords and a lot of other cars. i drive a toyota venza, toyota is universally bashed by all the automags for being really lacking in techology but i want to keep the car 20 years not to replace the whole car in 5-6 years when the computers are all broken.
getting a license in america is too easy. all drivers need to understand the seriousness of getting behind that wheel. driver's ed and by extension the process of being allowed to drive on the roads should be much tougher. cars today are being made to compensate for this lack of respect for the road. lane departure warning?
i own a 2016 tacoma and i would trust my 97 f350 more in 20 years then i would my tacoma. think about the single working mom 20 years from now driving a 2016 impala that cant go to work or take her kids to school because her car wont go into drive because a 250$ blind spot sensor is out that auto zone doesn't stock anymore?
main reason for bad serviceability on new cars is their assembly process comfort for the assembly worker and short assembly sequence times in the plant, to reduce cost for the car and of course to grow the profit per car, the other reason is of course all the electro-crap pile as an example even the first vw phaeton had 61!
having been employed in the car industry for 7 years, i can assure you that car industry is just another scam pulled on the gullible public, organised 'globally' by the same elite. btw, this insane technology driven approach is just the painful transition into the age of electric vehicles. the old shit has to wear out first.
i think new cars are a consumer trap unless you already have a house. do a basic accounting course and one will realise just how crazy it is to borrow money you don't have and pay interest on top of that, so you can have an asset that depreciates 20% the day you buy it and goes on to lose most of its value a few years later!
no one in the past ever bought a new car while they were trying to live on their own and go to school. this isn't a problem with modern cars. and don't get me started on school shit. there are so many ways to save money on school that there are ways to make money from it. i made $300 going to community college for two years!
seems everyone is thinking that you must buy a car with all the bells and whistles. well, you don't. you can always by a more basic car in any body size you need that doesn't have a lot of the electronics in them. the cars in the video are meant for people that can afford that stuff. you don't need to have it to drive a car.
the less tech your car have the less problems and also cheaper to maintain and cheaper when you buy a car with less options. for me as long as it has the common necessity for family safety such as back up camera i'm fine with it. another is buying used saves you a lot of money. a lot of people buy cars for the sticker price!
thoes are okay points, i don't disagree with them, my third point would be as a consumer, as someone who's investing tens of thousands of dollars into a 1.5 ton rolling controlled explosion machine on wheels is do ur research, it is not car company's responsibility to make shure u have all the facts. take some responsibility
agree with everything and another thing, the engine and the chassis, the same standard engine technology since a dawn of times, you just get different shapes on same chassis and engines, mazda, honda, hyndai, kia and so on. im owner of 12y old car and it runs perfectly without all that shit touch screen and super electronics.
i agree in some ways. haha. the tech stuff they add to cars these days is cool but i see whatcha mean about the future issues etc. i have a 2009 car and its mostly still analog kinda car. dont even have any lcd screens of any type in my car. i like the analog controls and the simpleness of not having all this high-tech stuff.
i guess the problem is not with the cars, but the people. sure the electronics are the main issue with modern cars. but most people really want it. once you are used to it, you'll not give it up. i would not want to drive around in my volkswagen golf from 1990 anymore. and the looks. my cars sure ain't pretty, but they drive.
interesting and smart. thank you. this is the reason why i've prefered to buy a 2012 miata which is light and simple no bullshit inside. all about driving. and not expensive to upkeep. every cars are now heavier, costy, and obsolets technologies after few years. in a country like switzerland, the turnover is absolutly insane.
thats why you get a horse, dont need to service it, rotate between front and rear yard and all of a sudden you dont have to cut the lawn. package the poo and resell for gardeners, and if you geta really smart horse like mr ed, it can even make you money from acting when your not using it to get around. fuck cars, horses rule.
these are reasons why i bought a sport version of the mazda mx-5, fewer electronics, at least no touch screen. it is scary when looking down the road, planned obsolescence. my audi a6 has switches on the console, dirt collects there and now the entertainment system doesn't entertain at all. my dogs didn't help that situation.
we need a new henry ford. we need someone to go ahead and build a car for the masses, cheap, reliable, bare-bones, simple, and just good enough. i don't want sensors, cameras, powered this, powered that, etc. i want cheap, i want repairable. and the smart fortwo is close, but sure as hell ain't it too tiny for a daily driver.
2 fix your own car holy shit. it's like lego pieces. you don't need to be a rocket scientist to change a $30 brake pad. 3 technology just buy an older car and don't drive like a maniac. my accidents have been other people's faults, usually rear ending me. no amount of tech can prevent other people refusing to use common sense.
a youtuber who wants to make money. vsauce in another channel. he talks about science and is pretty entertaining, but many of his videos stretch the truth and details out of proportion to seem cooler than the video is. so if you are young, and worried, it's not that bad, lol. just think for your self and the answers will come.
reminds me of how i feel watching doug demuro's car reviews. while he's showing of all this ridiculous tech, all i can think of is the next owner 10 years down the line trying to keep the damn thing running. hell, even my 2001 corvette has some over complicated features that have broken that will be difficult expensive to fix.
easy, manipulate the media to hype up about the new car, the new phones, the new laptops, etc so, in turn the sheeples get excited about the new no meaning technology, they buy them and the corporations earn more money, this cycle will keep on running if the sheeples don’t wake up and start spending their money where it’s worth
i was all about getting an sc400 once and when i found the perfect car decent mileage price, dark metallic blue, chrome factory wheels i went to test drive it and the electronic control for the climate control, etc was shot. i'm not even going to tell you how much that would have costed to replace. totally ruined the whole car.
most $40,000 dollar cars today are leased, you don't need to buy the car, its a long term rental that you get snuckered by the $599 month payment and free warranty, then you turn it in and get a new one. we don't drive any more, we just steer the dam thing to get through the traffic to get to work so we can pay the car payment.
most car companies claim that their cars are recyclable and environmentally friendly, that's the biggest bullshit i've ever header about cars, if they really care about the environment, then they shouldn't build junk that you have to throw away every 4 to 5 years. most car parts are made in china, they shouldn t cost that much.
my mazda 3 tpms valve stems were made out of nickel. they slowly rotted away from road salt. one day i had a blow out and almost lost control. the very think that was supposed to help me almost hurt me and the bill to replace all 4 was over $500. i had my mechanic put normal valve stems in there and called it a day. total joke!
as you said with part 1, fixing cars even a couple years old is prohibitively expensive and it's definitely not wrapped into a constant car payment. maybe if you live and work in an urban center, it's possible to forego cars completely, but if you have the option of driving 20 min to work or 2 hours on a bus, which would you do?
i have the same problems with my 1994 s320 but i’d rather cry my self to sleep because my car is so expensive then to own such a basic car i can fix it myself because it’d have to be so basic. it’s like i’d rather be 2 million in debt then now where i owe $0 because i could go cry about it in my private jet on the way to germany
i liked the emphasis you put on “capitalism” when you raved your incessant opinions, but the question is would you prefer a communist over-lord to force you to buy one of these at the point of a gun or do you like the capitalist ideology of having the free choice to own one of these modern contraptions at your own risk and cost?
i'm happy with my '03. no rust and it hasn't let me down yet!. it almost makes you wonder what is worse for the planet. throw away cars with marginally better fuel efficiency, or if everybody bought used, or held onto their cars to cut down on the resources and energy needed to build hundreds of thousands of new cars every year.
let me put it this way! . my car, an old merc 230te 1985 is still in almost perfect conditions, everything works as new, except for a couple of door auto airlocks easy top replace! . but i like them not working, so no one can open the car from the outside unless i open it manualy from the inside or with my key from the out side!
my 95 gmc van is considered new tech to me and i gutted all the hi tech junk airbag brake chip ect so now it has 300k on it but runs great i know how to fix everything on it cheep, i am lord willing going south to buy a early 70s to late 60s pickup and rebuilding motor trans ect for about 2k and that will be my emp proof hoopty.
probably not, but if all i have to do is put $99 down for the iphone, than sure it's only $99. that's our modern day economy in a nutshell. the banks won a long time ago, we have allowed ourselves to become dependant on them. the american dream leaves you working for tha banks, paying interest till you have nothing left to give.
technically speaking about technology more specific automotive industry technology. first there is a element of overcoming inherent risks in driving a 3000 lb plus vehicle down a given highway. alot of us are technologically and risk indifferent. reflection of one texas area and a random rainy day. you get 65.reported accident s
the biggest problem is that it is basically, simply, without a doubt, the same piece of shit, explosion, carcinogenic bullshit with a new suit on. nothing different from the first combustion egine ever built other than a new body. is this all we expect. is this really as far as we shpuld have evolved with this. i don't think so.

the concept of paying and maintaining modern cars subsystems, e.g. safety, camera,. etc, is the same concept hp printers used for ages. you need to keep paying expensive cartridges which won't last a thing. now hp is fucked at least in third world countries like mine. the much cheaper and reliable epson refill system broke them.
the front seats and driving position are often terrible on modern cars. they cheap-out on the seat and the amount of room for taller bigger people. the seats adjust in 100 ways, but they don't slide or tilt up enough. they are all built for people about 5 feet tall and 125 pounds. even big luxury cars and suvs have this problem.
buy the parts from advance auto, napa, autozone, ect. and fix it yourself. it really isn't that hard to both figure out what you're looking at and figure out how to fix it if you just open up your hood every once in a while and use google. 3 i have driven in cars that sport much of the newer tech. you know how often i may use it?
i bought my wife in 2016 a 2013 toyota 4runner sr5 with 24k miles, i was looking for the 3 row seat and limited package but then i stopped to think imagining all those components going bad like the touchscreen system the sensors etc. i told her with the money we save staying basic we can travel and do other things and activities!
i'm still waiting for a car where they put in a personal assistant like siri or google plus, but specific to the car. like i can command stuff like, turn the headlights lights on, or turn the temperature to 15 or 25 degrees etc etc. and ask the car to play a specific radio station. that would greatly help minimise road accidents.
my acura rdx 2008 all acura had a hands-free link bluetooth that drained substantial mount of power out of a battery after it failed. there are alot related issue from this hand-freaking link problem. it was okay after disconnected it. technology failure causes another potential unfavorable problem further than we expect. sighed.
so good. so damn good. feels like car journalists just dont give a shit. so happy to hear somebody genuinely address this. no way you will be able to maintain these things long term like current used cars, which are bad enough. what a disaster we're creating for poor people and young people. but whatever, gotta have more screens!
yes, what you are saying is true, but we asked for this technology. technology is the dream of man. many years ago we dreamed so much about these things and we now have them. but sadly these come at a price, literally and figuratively. you can make choices though. if you think you don't need some fancy equipment, you can skip it.
good point on cost of cars. i bought new. no regrets, but i got 0% apr no finance cost, and my research indicated it would be very reliable. repair cost would be higher but infrequent. most all required maintenance is within my skill level. my biggest issue against buying used is the question, “am i buying someone else’s problem?”
my 90 miata has plenty of creaks and sounds to it, still needs some tlc, and could really use a rebuild eventually. but hell, it sticks to the road, is super cheap and easy to fix, and i can haul ass around corners while getting 30 mpg. not to mention, you get smart about how to pack things, so it honestly is a very practical car.
they went cheap and made them out of aluminum and they are having to replace the whole transmission because they ran out of shift forks,and the new transmissions have the same forks so it’ll happen again. all to save a few pennies in production costs. used to be a nice car would set you back 20k,but now a mustang gt costs $45,000!
you cant expect manufacturers to update their old models, when they throw out a new model every 4 years. it would kill this consumerism which they achieved. they dont want to make cars that are still usable after 10 years. you could, but the amount of maintenance would be too costly so basically you can say, its nearly impossible.
the problem you're complaining about doesn't really exist. new cars are not the only option, that's the reason that certified pre-owned is a thing that exists. yeah, you probably wouldn't be able to reasonably afford a brand-spanking-new family car if you're 26, but why would you expect to or look at new cars with that expectation?
who cares anyway, when the cost of repair is not proportional to the cars value then it just gets left broken or botched up with a part from an auto wrecker thats right you wouldnt know what that is sorry i should say ebay or that car just gets sold. stop being a whinging whiney crying soft cock and have a go at fixing it yourself.
i don't know why they're even called family vehicles people don't need a nissan pathfinder, a toyota sequoia, a vw atlas, or what have you, to accommodate the average family. that being said, if you and your partner are crankin' out kid after kid after kid, and you can't afford these cars, maybe you ought to rethink your financials!
i have a e85 bmw z4 and i love it. it has all the safety tech wth a perfect 6 cil in line naturally aspirated engine. low cost maintenance and it looks and feels like new. on the other hand, i have an audi a4 2.0 turbo. it has,a lot of gadgets and computer controlled systems,. i'm always frgthened the car will fail and get me broke.
i live in place, where almost half of the year its really dark, not much sunlight. modern cars have so underpowered headlights, i mean they're bright, but you can not see a shit. also there is much snow, and that covers all lights. because of energy saving, car lights do not produce heat like older ones ,and thus snow does not melt.
solution for me keep the old car and take care of any problems myself. there's absolutely nothing wrong with a well kept 13-year-old car my current vintage if you're willing to live without all the bells and whistles and learn a little fixin', 10 years from now the question is moot anyway, since we'll all be driving driverless cars,
what struck me when i was learning to work on cars over the summer, is how far those infotainment systems have gone. i cannot remember the car, either a bmw, merc or jaguar, but it had access to live broadcast tv on the tough screen, in sight of the driver. there didn't seem to be anything stopping you from using it while driving 😐
i fully understand the point. but the world is evolving into technology because of competition. you don't have to purchase all the added tech. i have a 2016 chevrolet silverado ls, w o all the unnecessary technology, i purposely bought the ls for that very reason. the only thing it has modern is the touch screen. i'm fully satisfied.
i think one of the biggest problems with modern cars is that they are so useless for anything but transporting people. there is a big market out there for cars that can do more. just think of this one simple area, how many cars have completely fold flat rear seats cargo area with room enough for you to lay flat comfortably and sleep?
my 1997 i30 is always the oldest car on the road, but it still breathes fire and the ac works. i’ve been in it 12 years, i don’t know where the years went, it always rode and performed so well, drove smooth, great pickup, and handling, i didn’t realize it was getting long in the tooth until my mechanic said, “it’s time to let it go!”
i was in mechanical engineering wanted to design cars but it is good thing i got out of it. with all the government restrictions and all this pointless tech in cars im glad i did't finish the career and instead went into something else. useless technology bumps up the price tag the less gizmos and computer a car has the better for me.
im a mechanic by trade and alk the shit car companies are putting in cars today is because of lazy, idiotic people. no one wants to drive a manual anymore because of traffic and holding a clutch. most americans dont even know how to drive correctly or are too damn careless to pay attention to the rd. it isnt the cars, its you america!
the very innovations that manufacturers say will simplify our lives is ironically making life more complicated. there are too many fucken gadgets on new cars. most fully mechanical cars last longer. anything electronic is prone to more failure. all this technology is change merely for the sake of change. it is not progress in my view.
this is why i drive a 1989 toyota celica lx, the last toyota wihout a brain. entry is with a keyed handle, windows roll up with cranks, manual shift, etc repairs are low cost or i can maintain and fix stuff myself with inexpensive parts comfortable and cruises all day long at 80 mph. just with it was diesel instead of ethanoled gas. .
u are the first guy i heard speak the truth, and things i am tired saying its like the hospital, a doctor will not make u better because your his income, he will give u medicine to suppress one thing and start up another with its side effects and u have to go back to him to get another medicine to suppress that one to and so on and on
you did some very good insight research and you give us a very good idea about the real affair of owning a newer technological car. this is why i hold onto my 88 crxs and my older pre- 2004 vehicles. both my crxs will be outrunning all of those techno go go gadget cars and still have the tech if i need to add it when i want to add it.
i have the money to get a nice car 50k budget ish at 27 years old, and i dont think the issue is technology as repairs stay in line with them its the proprietary repairs. i cant just hook up my laptop it could be doable and run a diagnostic on my car. i need a shop, even if i am willing and able to do a lot of basic maintenance myself.
i hope there's a shift back to real controls sometime in the future when this ipad in the dash crap has run its course. if we weren't obsessed with redesigns every few years, the price of cars would come down from scale. but, it's partially driven by competition in the marketplace and partially by ever changing government requirements.
i've bought 2 cars in the last 2 years that had 105,000 on the odometer. the key is to buy quality cars that have been maintained and be able to do maintenance yourself. i've never had to replace a gauge cluster, only changed a headlight bulb a few times, and was able to perform minor maintenance. i rarely take my cars into a mechanic.
ill never buy any car past maybe 08. otherwise i'll stick with 90s. easy to work on. no fancy touchscreen or useless electronic parking aids. drop new engine,trans and boom,car lasts another 20 years. if i want to be stylish or get out of town, rent for 60 bucks for the weekend once a month if that. so $500 a year vs $5000. nice video!
just a note at of the video, the comparison totals of part repair replacements that are itemized are incorrect correspondingly, the percentage increase is incorrect. the correct total for the 2006 honda should be $967. therefore, the percentage increase by the time of the 2016 honda is 92 percent more expensive, rather than 27 percent.
and because of that i would never buy a car newer than 1993 with my own money. f*ck capitalism. i have no problems with spending 5000 oder 10000 for a car, but it has to be at least 25 years old. even if the car just costs 500 go ahead and invest a few 100 for repairs and conservation and it will run run for many years without problems.
if you looked at things like this you would be deeply depressed and not able to function. i agree about the new cars and costs. when an old car breaks weekly and monthly you end up paying a lot as well. can't watch cry baby videos like this anymore. suck it up. that's life. be a man not a poor me find a way to make the money. solutions.
my battery died on my 2007 jeep grand cherokee 5.7 hemi and the whole computer forgot what a gas pedal does and the throttle was completely useless, thankfully i have a great mechanic who came by and retaught the computer the throttle sensor system for $40 bucks, thankfully i only paid 6.5k for the thing and it hauls ass on and off road
my car has a touchscreen which requires me to take one hand off the wheel, look at the screen instead of the road, and touch a legal disclaimer box confirming that i will concentrate on my driving rather than be mesmerised by the touchscreen. it does this about twenty seconds after i turn the engine on, so that i am already on the road.
since most of the car's tech and software is proprietary, owners have to take it back to the dealership, which means more money in their pockets. the car manufacturers could give you the car for free and make money off repairs, etc. plus the car companies make money off the bloatware that is added into the sound system, navigation, etc.
awesome comments. affordable used cars stopped being made about 10 years ago. a neighbour runs a very successful spares business. he says he will sell up in 10 years as the spares market is dying. you don't but a simple mirror or wheel trim. you have buy the sensors. ultra low profile tyres on a family car are you listening gm and seat??
everything can be found on your steering wheel. without you touching a thing. i could also not help your gm rant about apple and android, i agree the mylink system lacks updates which i find shitty from gm as a company. however did it ever occur to you that maybe apple did not allow it legally yet in 2015 just speculation here but still?
having to take your eyes off the road to look at the screen puts you and others in danger. before the era of touch screens you use to blindly adjust things using your muscle memory. everything had its own nobs and buttons. now you have to dig though menus taking your attention off the road. you can't tell me this hasn't caused accidents.
i love my extremely reliable 2010 mazda3 hatchback that has all the modern comforts. hid headlights, led lamps all around, heated seats, dual zone climate control. but none of the fancy touch screen tech. sure. new vehicles are enamoring, but i just can't let this car go because it's done me so well and it's so cheap to own and maintain.
i really don't think i'm ever going to buy a new car it's just garbage plastic and computers buy an old car and you'll be happy forever easy as fuck maintenance, reliability, style, plus cheap as fuck. buying a new car is for idiots who think or pretend to have more money than they actually do. i would take a bmw e30 over any new shitbox
if you have the capacity to own a new modern car would you not have the basic commonsense to research its features before you enter into ownership of such a machine, or at lest have the commonsense to realise that as outdated as its features will be in the future it will still do what it was designed to do when you agreed upon ownership?
it gets especially frustrating when some tech gizmos are connected that shouldn't be, like the gearbox and tire pressure monitoring. imagine not being able to put your car into d because you stopped on the top of a mountain pass for lunch and now your tire pressure is out of bounds because you're at a high altitude and the tires got cold
problem with modern cars is lots of unnecessary complicated electronics and making them bad on purpose so they will break down and need repairs. my 1991 mercedes 190e only needed changing of shock absorbers and other parts of normal wear, same 20 years i had that car other people i know did buy 3-6 new cars that all needed major repairs.
there are advantages, granted. but, i cannot exchange a lightbulb. everything is hidden, packed and tucked away. there is so much added to the cars, which means there is more to break down. from extra sensors inside in the engine to electric windows. added weight and added items to break down. and -you need a laptop to diagnose your car.
first video of yours i have seen. and i am very impressed. i see a fair number of car reviews. and you are the first person who ever mentioned how pricey they are to buy fix and the down-the-line system updates. i had not even thought of the system updates on these newer cars. great, great video, imo. i am now a subscriber to you channel.
i didn't buy my first new car until i was 38. i didn't die. it was cheap, too, with barely a radio. it lasted me for 150k miles with some major maintenance, now cars are expensive to fix, but are far more reliable than even the basic '70s or '80s cars. as much as i am ambivalent about the amount of tech in new cars, they work pretty well.
crank windows, regular keys that cost $3 bucks for a copy, manual transmission. no frikin screens anywhere. i hate the screens everywhere modern lifestyle. it only adds frustration and annoyance. i prefer to use my brain and muscles, and save money. proud flip phone owner too. never bought into the smartphone myth. it really is not smart .
the car is a joke,nikola tesla already found out how to transfer subject and human beings and puppies and chocolates to another place through electricity wires. and the electricity is the free energy in our world, you can pick up anywhere,we don't need to pay anything to dp&l,we don't need to pay gas,but we are ants,they want us work hard.
the whole part about american culture that makes it so appealing is the constant turn over of getting the latest and greatest. this to me seems to be more about anti-capitalism anti consumerism, which is fine but what is the alternative that will simulate the economy in the same way while providing a platform for technological progression?
heater and radio controls should never be in the touch screen, they should always be analog. people shouldn't have to go scrolling through a touch screen to find their heater and radio controls. a gps or some of the other things are different, no other way really around but having them in the touch screen, but heater and radio controls, no.
i have been hearing reading the same comments for over 30 years. in the old days it was more like “you can’t repair simple things by yourself. bigger motors without room to move around then”. mechanics weren’t complaining back then, as it was bringing more revenue. now things are more complex and cars aren’t just mechanical devices anymore.
i totally agree, with everything you mentioned, but you dint mention the design. all new cars, look more or less the same to me. like bubbles with fancy sporty lines also i would like to mention, that the tail lights of newer audi models, are capable of destroying the eyes. has anybody else notice how annoyingly bright these red lights are?
haha, you complain about cars being 20-30-40.000 usd for a brand new family car. lets try this for a comparison. subaru crosstrek 2.0i 21.695usd on subaru.com usa in denmark where i live subaru crosstrek 2.0i 344.900 dkr 48.520 usd same car, more than twice as expensive in denmark. and you are talking about new cars are to expensive for you?
i am never buying a new car. they build them to have problems so you trade in for a new one. buy a honda or toyota. until gm takes tech out and put performance in. we stuck with finding and older car to rebuild. my 2015 colorado. ignition lock broke. with key in it. it won't turn. 50k on odometer. eats front brakes. tpsm rear pass. stays lit
i don't have a car. or license and i know a lo about technology also when i get me a car i'm getting a vehicle without a infotainment system and matter fact i'd rather have aftermarket infotainment system but, no. just a double din stereo with buttons cause i know what the side effects are and i'm smart not to text and drive unlike my sister
i don't have to watch this and tell you it's all the modern computer junk all in the car. navigation, cameras, t.v.s, and many other junk gadgets. i'll just take an older 1970's f-150 with no power windows, locks, heated seats, power mirrors, navigation or any of that. all that junk just distract the drivers making the road no where as safe.
it is for these precise reasons that i love my little '93 toyota. it has so little to go wrong, and even when it does, it's not too expensive to fix. the thing is 25 years old, and the frame is pristine. last state inspection, i needed brakes. the inspection the year before that, i needed a light bulb. simplicity and quality are a great mix.
ok, at with this comparison. 2016 headlights are much brighter and last much longer, being leds. a side view mirror, with a blind spot camera. i'll ignore the obvious improvements in the gauge cluster because they might not be neccesary according to you. direct injection is more efficient and cleaner burning why would both fuel pumps go bad?
software should be open source, especially for modern vehicles. if only consumers realized this we could demand these software be updated and maintained by the open source community preventing many issues with new technologies in these vehicles. issues like volkswagen's diesel emission testing scam software and proprietary whatever bullshit.
wow, a lot of social commentary in relation to modern cars. you are absolutely correct about the cost of modern cars, both to buy and to own. i’ve also noticed that some millennials are not interested in buying a car or even driving for that matter. my generation has a hard time understanding that, since we looked at cars as “freeduuuuuuhm!”
yep totally agree, i myself am in the process of buying a brand new car after passing my 13' honda insight to my son and i would love to get the honda fit which is perfect for my needs and of course the base model has very little of that tech crap which i hate and the best part is that it has an old fashion manually operated climate control.
$1800. decide you will forgo the most important service of all. the 100,000km major service. this service costs a grand but its actually worth it because it includes replacement of the cam drive belt. if you don't and the old one snaps its a $22,000 new engine after the pistons have smashed up all the valves and the engine self destructs. me?
i have 16 civic and i totally regret my purchase. mostly because it’s almost impossible to get the transmission fluid changed by myself but it’s already having electrical issues. my stereo makes a buzzing noise every once in awhile which startles me when driving. i’ve been making double payments and i’m planning on getting rid of it next year
it’s all about how you budget and how you spend. i’m 21 and have a $28,000 fiesta st. granted it’s not a 60k bmw but still. if you have your priorities right you can do anything. like seriously, not all good jobs need schooling, i’ve been higher over college graduates. but for me it’s in a kitchen, where experience is preferred over a degree.
just one other thing you can really see what hes talking about if you look at say a 2000 model 7 series. some love the design and some hate it. i like it and think that its somewhat timeless but that first i drive system is an absolute nightmare. now you can pick a car like that up cheap because those systems look so dated by todays standards
my problem with new cars is that they are making people who don't care about driving worse drivers by giving them all these driver aids and is also why i hate the braking systems to avoid accidents because people abuse this by not paying attention and text and drive and they not care and really on the tech the cars have it is really care less
problem no.1 toyota, honda are ur homie choices. problem no.2 all i need in modern vehicles about tech are bluetooth, back up camera, side mirror camera, good speakers. all other gimmicks head up display, onboard gps, pre collision warning, lane departure warning, auto parallel parking. arent necessary. the smarter ur devices, the dumber u r.
this dude talking about modern cars and he's driving one of the worst car you can own but he is right. i will not buy a brand new car unless i know i can afford to traded it in every year or so. i'll stick to my mid 90's pick up. rich people are spoiled anyway they want everything if the steering wheel has a suck me feature they get that too.
too physically big heavy, too technically complicated, too many useless systems crammed into one vehicle. i swear the manufacturers should just offer the drivetrain and chassis body and let you build up the car on top of that as you please, just like in the good ol' days, as the engines and bodywork is mostly very solid, reliable & efficient.
what a load of garbage. cars are cheaper now than they've ever been, and you get a whole lot more car for your money than you did 50 years ago. if you can't afford it, then there's something wrong with you and you need to get a proper job. america is the cheapest place in the world for cars. and you have cheap gas, cheap repairs, cheap parts.
cars suck. they pollute, they make noise. they make cities less livable due to congestion. they cause urban planners to design cities around cars at the expense of every other form of transportation. they eat money and put people in debt. i say walk, ride a bike and use public transit. they make more sense for rural areas, but suck for cities.
peple who lease their cars and change them every 3 years don't have to worry about the technology breaking, it's the 2nd, 3rd or 4th etc user that will have to pay the big bills when it fucks up, and it will. how could anyone buy a tesla model 3 with no physical buttons and no gauges, having everthing operating through the central touchscreen?
completely agree. problem #3 features or options have to be had with packages especially with trucks. example you want $150 rear locking differential well sorry you can't have that unless you get z71, fx4 suspension plus this interior plus this wheel choice plus this stereo so that $150 differential is now only available with $4500 package wtf!
dude, my first car was a 1966 ford, any car after that was more modern and cost more to repair and thats always been the case. 1989 holden calais power window motor $112 power windows door switch $28 vs 1966 ford falcon windows winder $19. the increase from the 60's to the mid 80's was a far bigger jump than what you are complaining about??????
i have and drive a 1945 willys mb, going on 75 years old and it is so fun, reliable and simple. there is not a single car made today that will be around in another seventy years. they are throw away garbage full of planned obsolescence. every year they go up in price to keep up with all the bs safety mandates and useless tech that nobody needs.
i really wanted to like this video and agree with you, but while speaking consumerism like an anti-conformist you're calling suvs family vehicles and have an obsolete view of evs, just doesn't make sense. the future will be car sharing, not buying cars at all. but only when the the people like you in the western countries understand that fully.
the tesla model 3, which starts at $35k, is the best car you can buy today. updates itself, drives itself. it's also the cheapest car to run, being all electric not only means that the fuel is cheaper, but also means that it hasn't got any moving parts apart from the motor itself, so no maintenance costs. with tesla, you're argument is invalid.
with good credit you can buy cars at $50,000 for $667 a month but the insurance is what kills me at 16 years old my insurance is $740 a month and if i didnt have my parents their to provide shelter and food i would not be able to afford the truck that i have i am very lucky and i appreciate my parents so much for not kicking me out of the house
and its just going to get worse. for example, the recent mandate that all vehicles must have a rear-view video camera and viewscreen by the driver so that we won't back over our precious children. because parents are too lazy to tell their children not to play behind a parked car. or the parents being a friend to their child than being a parent.
bad news car enthusiasts. you are part of a smaller crowd which car manufacturers who want to make a profit won't target entirely. sure theres pocket rockets like scion fr or a honda s2000 or even a ford focus rs for special occasions, but for everyday cars we need apple car play and android auto. btw i smell a tin foil wearing rat in the video.
car are made for the stupidest dumbest drivers on the planet and i am not talking about the ricers for german fan boys racing they are not the ones i worry about it is the female drivers who do not accelerate to appropriate speed merging, texting and driving, applying make up and driving, and basically not being situationally aware while driving
i have an 1600 dollar car im 26 i live whit my parents i have a job that considered ''well payd'' in hungary i can't afford a better car whit 7years of putting most of my money to the bank just to put it on perspective for you american folks the internet is dirt cheap tho so im here watching videos about cars i never gonna have the money to buy.
the two words modern cars. they're not modern. they don't fit into our lives at the present moment. every single one of them are built for the future. we don't need all these gimmicks at the present time. manufacturers should give its customers what it needs now, instead of what we will need in 10 years. bring back 90s cars, bring back the risk!
this has to start with the consumer. the reason that automakers cram so much tech stuff is because consumers demand it and therefore a market for same. i'm all for technology, but automakers should concentrate on getting back to basics and leaving the tech to the aftermarket. this would help keep cars affordable and hopefully people out of debt.
easy way to get around this problem. do you research, learn the basics of fixing and maintaining your own car and buy a cheap but very reliable used car from the 90s and early 2000s and you'll have a very reliable and easy to work on daily until you get your life together and afford the finer things in life such as a good home and brand new cars.
i wouldn't entirely blame capitalism. safety, security and cars, amongst other things, is highly regulated by the government, so it's no surprise that car companies cartelise in order to stay afloat. you simply can't create a driver experience today for normies. it's illegal, so they bombard you with meaningless stuff instead. talk to eric peters
i'm a technician and that's the biggest thing i see with modern vehicles way too much un needed tech and gadgets to go wrong so many times we have to send a vehicle to the dealership for certain things because it's something only the manufacturer is able to correct hence jacking the repair bill up which is probably why i won't buy a new car again
some valid points here, but do also think about how many people are buying cars that are actually within their means. my car is 14 years old, and it should make 20 years, given my projected income for the next 10 years. when i truly have to replace it, i will do so with a 1980's era mercedes w124. hopefully after that i will just uber everywhere.
well your last point about companies not being committed to updating software, that's really been an issue for 15-16 years you could argue. in my opinion it's a non-issue. it's part of the car. you don't buy a 2005 car and expect it to have a 2018 infotainment system. it's just part of the car being dated, just like every other aspect of the car.
100% on point. i don't want the technology but we really can't go backwards. like scott, i never want to see a touch screen in a car, ever. i can't avoid it. also, my dad said i could be whatever i want to be so i chose to be a disappointment. that's why i don't own a $42,000 car $60k in canada and instead, i drive a rusted out 2002 mazda protege.
couldn’t agree more, and to a large extent i blame the rental leasing culture. hiding the real cost of ownership while making a bundle off folks “buying” more than they can afford. all the gadgets are cool, as long as the car can last a lease term. then it’s next to worthless for someone who tends to buy long-term. welcome to consumer enslavement.
i can only imagine the next generation of electrical gremlins and mystery issues you have to chase down and all the plastic in innapropiate places a lot of this crap is designed to fail and if the average consumer doesnt pay attention and catch something in time over a flawed design choice made by the companies technicians will have a to repair it
i work in it and even i agree computers have no place in cars. personally, i drive 4 vehicles all of which are no newer than 1997. in fact my favorite is my 1956 chevy. for a vehicle, give me mechanical, analog and vacuum inputs and components all day long. i'll play with my super advanced computers during the workday and at home thanks very much.
one of my biggest complaints about modern cars was perfectly demonstrated as he was trying to swipe around the infotainment screens, and that is the inexcusable amount of lag with most of these systems. pretty sad when you can more quickly and more easily change basic functions on a car from the freaking 1950s than a car from nearly 70 years later.
they are more distracting, i mean in a older car you could adjust the heating controls with just touch you didn't even have to look you had a nob to turn you knew where it was it was a split second glance, now you have to look a lot more at what you are doing, more time with your eyes off the road, pressing up or down or looking for a certain temp.
they turned our once prized freedom machines into our ever-renewing indentured servitude. in california, annual registration fees are based on blue-book value. a 2017 pick-up truck can easily cost $1,500 to renew. 4yrs from now you'll be paying less, but most if not all your warranty will have expired on crazy expensive to repair replace gimmickry.
when i turned 40, i decided to buy my first and only new car. i knew even when i was young buying a new car is one of the worst financial decisions one could make so when i was to get one i knew it had to be one i was going to keep forever and didn’t care about resale value. i did it. don’t regret it. but i’m sure as hell paying for it. for 7 years
honda civic from 1995 can make 50 miles per gallon or more if you add an electric water pump today's cars you lucky to get 40 miles per gallon with all electronics weighing you down making the car heavier the simple cars from the past are more elegant because they get better efficiency without having to do so much to get it to the perfect sweet spot
i always tell poeple the best car is a paid off one. regarding the repairs, it's also bound to happen. everything modern day is made to only last a few years. like look at appliances, our fridge was brand new a couple years back and after 2 years it's just like falling apart. but the fridge in our basement from the early 90s is still running strong.
i couldn't agree with you more except to say that it's not manufacturers driving this shit it's consumers. if a manufacturer today dared to make a car without all that inbuilt shit they wouldn't sell. the one point i would add to what you say is that, eventually when shit does break down, there's no one skilled enough to fix it, even if you can pay.
i had just the opposite thought about the cost of cars. my cost of housing keeps going up and up and up. i live in an extremely high cost city, which high housing costs and high salaries. car lease deals seem pretty cheap. the finance rates are at zero percent. i plan on just leasing a car, and then after three years it's the manufacturer's problem.
if a car does not have traditional heater controls ie ials knobs, sliders, i'm not buying it. you need to keep your eyes on the road, not on a fucking tablet display stuck to your dashboard. stick your digital controls right up your arse. forgot to mention. cars are the other way the government love to drag you into debt, the main one being property.
the automobile prior to 1908 before ford came out with the model t was something only the rich can really afford. seems like we're heading to square one again. so when is another company or perhaps ford themselves realize that henry's idea of simplistic design, 4 wheels, decent power and prices $15000 and maximum out-the-door $20k will make a return?
the only tech i'd like in a car is a hud, so my eyes don't really have to leave the road. i don't give two shits about touch screens, video, gps, cameras, etc. okay, i do like a dash cam to cover my ass in the event some asshole is running an insurance scam. just give me a manual gearbox, a functioning engine, and maybe that hud. i rarely use my a c.
definitely agree with that touch screen controls are unsafe for drivers. but i think the best way to avoid them is simply not buying them. there are still numbers of manufacturers equipping nobs and buttons on their cars and those controls are safe and precise. when other manufacturers realize that people dont buy touch screens theyll get rid of them.
touch screen must go, or at least keep key functions as physical buttons. i also hate the fact that steering wheels are not mechanicaly connected to the wheel. i'm all about tech, since i work in it, but when it comes to cars, it is a big no. new cars does not have anything useful what old did not have other than fancier interior and nicer headlights.
i concur 100% with your sentiments. too much technology, built in obsolescence, it has to end sometime. that's why i drive dependable, no frills cars and keep them as long as i can. i have never paid more than $2000 for a vehicle. if you know what to look for, you can get wheels low cost, cheap to maintain and cheap to insure too. sheeple buy new cars.
i guess that is why i love my 2015 bmw, it doesn't have a touch screen monitor, but just a normal monitor with a spin controller. it offers basic utilities such as music using bluetooth or cds, vehicle servicing check engine light, oil, etc, and that's basically it. heating ac is old school. mileage is great and my favorite thing about it is the drive.
i think the problem is that consumers have become more resistant to maintenence and repairs and refuse to own a car out of warranty so change cars more frequently or purchased extended warranties they don't need. i think modern cars are just as reliable and maintenance isn't a bid deal you just have to get past the fear of owning a car out of warranty.
most car guys i know would rather have an older car with less bullshit on it, and most people who advocate for the new stuff use the same old if you dont like it its because you are poor argument. its like ok i can not afford other stuff but drive a new car where simple fixes are gonna cost $500 or i can dirve a kia from 2004 where most fixes cost $30.
never buy a car on credit. never buy a car that is not made in japan or korea. this includes nissan & toyota's. investigate the origin of manufacture. try to keep things simple but, look for 6 airbags, abs, stability control, cruise control. try not to spend over 10k. factor in gas milage part prices. f@#k keeping up with the jones's. most are in debt!
that is why i drive a base model 2000 bmw 320i. it doesnt even have a cd player, just a cassette player. but its such a sweet car to drive. especially because i paid only 1200 dollars for it, even though it had only 20k miles on it when i bought it a year and a half ago. oh yeh, of course it has m sport wheels. those base model rims were much too ugly.
utter sensationalist conspiracy bollocks at the expense of the engineer's reputation. noone out there is designing things into a car to deliberately offset the safety features. moral implications aside, the capitalist model you propose is flawed. do you have any idea how much income is lost when a person can claim that an accident was caused by design?
a major topic with old gear heads like myself. talking socially. how many middle class white guys can even change their oil of do very simple start troubleshooting. very few. most customers in auto parts and pick part junkyards are those that can't afford otherwise. the days of waking up satuday morning and saying, i'll rering my car this weekend, true!
fuck crash detection, fuck abs, fuck parking sensors, fuck 460 airbags and modern crumple xone technology, fuck all of that shit. i want a 1970 lada vaz-2101. good stronk russian engineering, no electronics, no safety, no power, no emissions regulation because fuck the planet too, because no equipment means no problems, ohh shit comrad, it still breaks!
great video. i mean he's a bit depressing, but right consumer capitalism, make shiny shit and then its next years legacy tech. people buy the latest to keep up with the neighbours or colleagues, like buying a tesla for $100k when its basically a battery, electric motors and a body that looks like a ford mondeo. who cares about how fast it gets to 60mph?
honestly, i think the main problem is cars are not made to ride them. modern car is every other thing it will save you if you crash, it will entertain you in a traffic jam, it will open it's trunk and do other things that not so much related with the purpose of driving. that's why cars used to have souls up untill the this single-use era, in my opinion.
i always buy a base model. no power options, no driver aids gadgets, simple knobs for radio and heat. less to go wrong. many new vehicles now have a design change every 2-3 years. finding spare drivetrain body parts for them will be next to impossible to find. cars before had no changes for 10 years. parts for those cars are everywhere in wrecker yards.
i remember cooking my 1985 pontiac fiero's engine back in 2003. in 2004 i had a mechanic install a 2.5l chevy celebrity engine in it & with labour is was ~$2,500. think about it a whole new engine plus installation for less than $3k. today, if the cvt craps out on my current car a 2007 jeep patriot, i think the cvt alone will be more than $2,500. crazy.
idea a car that encompasses technology in a smart way. take the most reliable old car, and redesign it and miniaturize the tech. while at the same time adding features mostly for safety. fuck comfort. gotta keep costs down. use a lot of standard connectors to make modding and repairs easy. a car for the working man. who the fuck needs heated cupholders?
no. in modern technology updates usually decrease performance not make them better on older hardware, also, vehicles aren't becoming more expensive, the top ranges maybe, but cars are cheaper now than ever taking inflation into account in na, interest rates can swing that though. overall, this video is an opinion without proper thought or fact checking.
what i don't like about cars in general is that they are stuffed with technology that i maybe use 10 to 20 minutes a day. that's why i would never buy a car with integrated navigation system. i've got a perfectly functional smart phone which i can take with me whereever i go. the horrible utilization ratio of an average person's car is absolutely crazy.
when i was young, i figured cars would get cheaper and cheaper to own because as technology moves forward, manufacturing costs decrease. then i realized that they keep putting newer and better technology into cars so the price stays high. now, i'm disappointed to realize that the technology manufactured into vehicles does not move forward with updates .
buy that same car after the 2 year lease is up. all of a sudden you have the same car but it costs $25k. assume 30000 miles as that is the standard and you get a nice car only 2 years old with an extended warranty that can go another 70000 miles or 7 years in many cases. why are you standing next to a suv which have the biggest make up in the car market?
i have my deawoo lanos from 1997, i don't give a shit what anyone thinks. maintainance is cheap and easy, car is reliable whiteout stupid modern electronics and computers systems. when i see a modern expensive vehicle on the road, i always think look, another money pit machine with a computer error code underway to the stealership to get ripped of again.
for one thing, this is a cuv or suv. why try to buy a vehicle you can't afford. if you never open and read the owners manual to learn the features and functions of the tech and systems and simple service and care of your vehicle over time. if you never get it serviced in 5 or 7 years expect major damage and parts worn out. this video is stupid and simple.
i disabled destroyed the chime on a 2007 focus i had because ford's shit is especially irritating. not as bad as honda's quad-beep, though. i currently drive a saab 900 that does so much annoying crap, but one of the most irritating is it immediately harps at me to check the brake lights the moment i start it up. give me a fuckin' second, you needy bitch!
i have been driving my i30 since 2013 and it is still great today and running costs have been cheap as chips. i can see how other modern cars can be a pain after 5 years, my dads vw gti had an issue in its engine and his only option was to replace it so he auctioned it for parts. if you get the staples, toyota, hyundai, mazda, you can have them long term.
most of the coolest technology that goes on a car built today, requires you to stop the fucking car pull to the side of the road and set whatever it is you need. the worst are the self parking cars, i have tested 3 of course none of the dealers have the time to spend with you having a car self park. now wanna have a useless and totally cumbersome feature?
the newer cars have too much high tech features that distract the drivers from concentrating on their driving like the gps, touch screens, apple car play, menus, etc. i recently bought a new mercedes-benz c300 and its loaded with all kinds of high tech “bells and whistles” that i don’t even care about using them because they are too complicated to operate!
this is why i drive an '87 jetta diesel, no electronics, to give numerous expensive problems. albeit slow, it does 60 miles to the gallon, having said that the last car i would buy today would be a vw group car, or any european car for that matter, i' ve seen the amount of expensive electronic faults they give. the humble toyota corolla would be my choice.
you forget who was the idiot that wanted to get all the old used cars off the road. he had a law passed which he signed, that brought all the older used cars off the road to be destroyed so they could go thousands of dollars deeper in debt. now we don’t have any newer used cars for young people that would like transportation at a lower price. thanks obama.
i am a mechanic and people are so disgusted when i tell then that they have to take their vehicles back to the stealer-ship for a key that may cost more than $100.00 when they want to go to walmart to get a $1.99 key. by the way they have to get the vehicle towed because the vehicle's computer doesn't recognize the key anymore so the vehicle will not start.
i still drive my 2003 chevy avalanche 1500 pickup truck as my personal vehicle. i really like how the technology is very practically applied, with limited led displays. i hope to get 300k miles from it, and i will be very griped when i must trade it for a modern vehicle. here are a couple of personal finance tips concerning vehicles. learn from my mistakes.
ill keep my 02 7.3l diesel with 209k miles on it, just the right amount of technology none of this touch screen bluetooth junk. if i wanted it i would just upgrade my headunit, it is cheaper than a new car. i also enjoy metal bumpers, i can work on it if need be, and its as reliable as any new car out there, because lets face it even new cars have problems.
it happened to my friends grand cherokee, engine kept running but fans did not turn on and it overheated damaging cooling system components. to shut it down the battery needed to be disconnected but required tools to access it under front seat. this is why industrial equipment has and emo button. why don't cars that don't have a key switch to cut off power.
one of the things i hate most about modern vehicles are the massive fucking pillars. sure, great if you rollover i suppose, but i'd rather avoid a rollover to begin with. and they cut down visibility so goddamned much it makes accidents much more likely, so they add on a bunch of blind spot monitoring systems and cameras and shit and charge you more for it!
parts are a total scam courtesy of the manufacturers cartel. they make parts way too expensive so that you decide to get rid of the vehicle because economically speaking maintenance will cost you the same as buying new. that's one issue with modern cars, but the truth is that vehicles have gone a long way in efficiency, security and confort. it's undeniable
second point with technology is moot if you just buy an older used car and that without having to compromise too much on safety. besides, safe motoring starts with the driver, not the car. stop blaming society, technological progress, [enter your favorite scapegoat here] etc. for your rich world problems and start taking responsibility for your own choices.
the ability to collect cars has also died with the more modern infotainment systems. look at how well robust tech from the 70's and 80's has held up and tell me that we will have collectors cars of the first gen of pure garbage that is on the road now. the era of collectors cars is over. even jeeps suffer from this now. oh look we can be modern too! -- jeep
they make modern vehicles so expensive that you have to finance or lease and trade it in before repairs kick in. its by design. housing is the same, raise the price so high that you cannot afford to pay cash or save up as rent cleans out what you might save towards a house. you can own a 500,000 home for only $1500 a month at 2% interest. over 30 years. lol
for me the biggest problem is paying for shit i absolutely don't need. panoramic roof, parking sensors, steering wheel and seat heating, chrome handles that do absolutely nothing but make me cost shitload of money. all the while they can't seem to make a clutch that would last more than 30k miles. i will continue to drive my p206 for as long as it will move.
i see the same thing with cars ans suvs you have to step up a whole trim level just to get one option you want, that one option might only be a few hundred dollars but the next trim level just the price up 3,4,5k its just ridiculous. what happened to the day where you could build the exact vehicle you want with out all the added bullshit that you don't want?
i worked in the motor trade and no one salesman had a modern car as his own unless it was supplied by the company. in fact they were more into bikes than cars. i drive a very low tech car because the tech makes no difference to the cars driving entertainment. in fact the radio is hardly ever on because i'd rather listen to the engine exhaust noise. electric!
shame you guys don't have dacias. a base model dacia sandero is $8k new. everything except safety features is old tech, so you have crank windows, physical knobs and switches, no touchscreens etc. unfortunately to have ac you need to buy the higher trim $9.5k oh woes me. by modern standards it's a shit car, but this shittyness makes it surprisingly reliable.
try a year 2000 or later bmw. or any older car. technology now is better packaged and much more durable. in fact cars last much longer now than they did 15 or 20 years ago there for used cars now last as long as new cars did in the 80s. compared to inflation cars are still the same price as are parts i don't know what the heck this guy is even talking about.
when it comes to infotainment systems all i want is a nice screen with open hardware behind it and an os like i android so i can install what i want and how i want it. all the car infortainment systems i've used are slow clunky pieces of garbage. why is this so hard for car manufacturers when even the cheapest phone these days gives a better user experience?
and that's the reason why a shitty used toyota fortuner shitty and unsafe but simple and reliable costs more in my country than newer used ford explorer or jeep grand cherokee models specially the 2011-present models, also an used 2006-2009 toyota 4runner cost the same as a 2011 jeep grand cherokee or ford explorer because it proved to be a very reliable suv.
car makers are assholes. cars do not need 80% of the shit they currently have. that shit weighs a ton, costs a fortune, and just makes a car bad. my best car is a 1969 911s the car has 4 electric motors in it one to start the car. one to run the clock. one to wipe the windows, and one to pump water onto the windshield. that's it. the seats don't even recline!
this is dumb. point 1, yeah no shit new stuff is expensive, buy used, you can still buy used with a warranty if you want. point 2, this is not a problem unique to modern cars, my 13 year old vehicle has a tape deck which is entirely pointless now. it also has climate control which is broken because the blower resistor has gone. ancillaries lose compatibility.
totally true about cars becoming throw away items. i work for a major automotive supplier, and the brakes that i design will be fitted to million of car, millions of cars i will never buy i know damn well that shit aint serviceable, and if it were to go bad, it will cost over 1400 dollars to replace it. the conventional system it replaces costs 140 brand new.
you can get a very decent family car for a lot less than 40k. also, despite the addition of new technology cars are getting on average more reliable and long lasting. active safety technologies have provably contributed to reduced accidents. most of your points are really weak but i do agree on touch screens, they are just a poor interface choice for driving.
you guys suck. because you are right. i was on the fence on getting a 2019 ford f-150 or ram. jeez di problems from hell or touch scree computer gadget problems from hell in the future. so yeah went with something i can fix, a modular almost a lego car 2006 subaru forester xt. god damn simple, the new way of the future buy old simple. here in so cali no rust!
new cars are ridiculously expensive because of all of this tech. it’s keeping us all in debt so we can have infotainment and lane departure assist. the only reason you need lane departure is to prevent you from crashing from playing with your infotainment. however, i will say that cars are the ultimate consumer item. they are designed to be used and discarded.
not only that it is very expensive to have it people developing systems, but also the hardware physically needs to be replaced in some cases. you were complaining about the cost of modern vehicles before, well, this would be contrary to that because manufacturers will have to increase the cost of the vehicle in order to be able to justify the price of updating
that's the way it should be. inventing producing selling delivering upgrading and then repeat the loop again. some of the new features are total shit, some of them are superb. going forward requires patience, persistence and going on through a lot of unnecessary shits. the sad thing is, that the market is the main stimulation for all that advancing technology.
you're awesome savage. brutally honest reviews consistently without being bought by manufacturers or products. some of these people don't understand that you're not clearing six figures a year making videos, this is done on your time and on your dime. you're on to something powerful with what you are doing. keep it up my friend. you've got a subscribe from me!
get a fucking job and stop trying to make a living off of silly youtube videos. then maybe you can afford to buy and maintain a modern car. and btw, the car industry isn't a big conspiracy theory. car manufacturers build cars with features that buyers demand. it's really as simple as that, so blame society if you don't like how things have progressed over time.
i like the way they are going. a few more years and we can have disposable cars. the safety and efficiency keep getting better i think its worth it. the cost to properly maintain a 10+ yr old car is not usually worth it. all the grumpy people who want their 98 camry or 87 pickup can still drive them if they want, no one is forcing people to buy these cars. yet!
l agree 100% with what hes saying.anyone that buys a new car is either rich or is simply asking for trouble.lve got an old 1989 patrol with 600000 km on it doesn't use any oil and is the original motor untouched.the clutch has been replaced once and gear box has had bearing overhaul.original diiff which still winds from day one.would l buy a new car.never ever.
one way to look at it is that car manufacturers are building a product that combines something that should last for 20 years drivetrain, chassis, body with something that will be obsolete in 5 electronics content, it's like when they used to build tvs with built-in vcrs. i'm looking forward to when car replacement parts start getting obsoleted at a faster rate.
sounds like you're hooked on the latest technology, wanting constant upgrades etc. that kind of thinking is why the car companies are piling more and more on all the time with obsolescence guaranteed. maybe we should be asking for basic simplicity in the gadget department and keeping it familiar, easy to use, and less costly, with far safer highways guaranteed.
bought my tesla model 3 six-months ago, and already have had 3 over the air software updates to the car that have in various ways, improved performance, improved safety e.g., shorter braking distances, and mostly introduced and improved driving features each time making the car simply more and more fun to drive. tell me another car company that even comes close.
repairing cars is even harder when the car hits the 15-20 year old mark where the unusual parts that are starting to break theres no stock for. things like steering wheel clock spring, seat belt gear mechs, sensors, gearbox synchros gears bearings, even simple shit like indicator stalks and door handles. so where's the sweet spot for someone who's an average jo?
the first problem is is that schools don't teach simple principles like budgeting, saving money and investing. cars are not an investment. they will not save you money or hold their value. don't get me wrong they can get you from point a-to-b and in some cases faster, but that's it. cars are a hole in the wallet. this is coming from a guy that loves racing cars.
the more a car becomes modular, computer like, the less of a second problem you will have. currently, the change is not even yearly, it's much quicker. the more companies like tesla appear, the bigger chance of other huge it brands joining the playground is. i think second option is almost a history even today. one or two years we will probably forget it at all.
go to school, get good grades, work hard the one thing you didn't figure out is you also have to be smart. get a job you can grow in. that's how you make good money. you say that's the fall of capitalism, yes and no. capitalism does allow companies to make some shitty stuff, but, it also allows you to not buy any of it. don't want all the fancy stuff in your car?
this is why i lease. you've always got the latest tech, the car is always under warranty, and you can always get out of it if you have to. sure you always have a car payment, but it seems to me that most people who buy end up trading the car in before they're finished paying it off anyways. it's hassle free and you never have to worry about long term maintenance.
best part of my jeep is the esp i can turn off, i know a lot of people find tech scary, but really there are very old analog examples of almost everything we have on modern vehicles. i think really people are uneducated and lack any kind of insight into what is in their day to day vehicles or even appliances do or how they do it. this leads to misinformed choices.
modern cars are the worst in history because of greed everything on modern cars is only done for one reason because it's the cheapest way from plastic parts and electronics designed to fail to third world made components builr with the worst material and the worst quality control and as long as people are stupid enough to keep buying them, they will only get worse
not sure i'm buying all of this. my daughter survived perfectly by riding in normal cars, which cost almost nothing. her own 2013 fit was $16k total new. i can see someone wanting a van when they have 4 kids, but not before. now the 2nd half may have a kernel of truth in it. the state of infotainment is horrendous, and nobody seems to realize it except elon musk .
simple buy a reliable used or certified pre-owned car. my parents are not too old, they both have decent jobs, and they are both able to afford all the stuff we need with them, me, and my grandmother. away from me though, pre-owned and used cars are almost as good as new cars. you can still find a few years old car with modern technology for almost half the price.
that's why i bought a jeep tj. they last forever, parts are very cheap, very easy to work on, very reliable and durable, very customization, little complex electronics, and very good looking in my opinion. only downside is that it lacks safety features abs,sensors,etc, and has no luxury features power windows, electric door locks,etc which i personally don't mind.
i have had the same concerns as well. i think the ‘90’s and early 2000’s cars will be considered the golden era of used cars to buy. modern enough to be reliable and comfortable but still simple and not bogged down with tech. the cell phone analogy is perfect. i think the only good modern cars for the long term might be the base models with the least amount of tech
if it goes off on a vehicle that's out of warranty, the car is usually considered totaled when the speed controller fails for the fan you are out 250.00 when the 10.00 chinese brake lines rot out n your 50k vehicle and cause catastrophic failure. catalytic converter sets your car on fire. why do you have to remove the entire intake system to replace a knock sensor?
it's good to see someone condemning our electronic dependency. too bad he had to rely on more high tech devices to do it. i'll bet that if some auto maker could make a really low tech, fix it yourself kind of car, they could sell millions of them. that's one reason why i own a model a ford, to show you how really low tech a car can be and still get you from a-to-b.
not including gas. i bought a used 1985 1 ton chevy truck for 2 grand. had the motor rebuilt and fixed some other things as well like water pump, heater core and brakes. the drive train was fine. manual trans. i spent 4 grand for the repairs. in the same 4 year span for insurance and tags i spent about 1,500 bucks. so after all that, i spent a total of 7,500 bucks!
so this has nothing to do with actual problems. there are a few issues which get addressed but then we get editorial opinion. if he thinks no one is going to come up with software update he is missing how the secondary market works. also assume you keep a modern car for 7 years. that means everything he notes is accounted for in the used car price. nav is outdated?
there is always the option of choice. find a basic car, without options. no gadgets, no airco, no satnav, no electric adjustable mirrors and windows. you will be cool. i think there is a market for these car. call it back to basic or retro, the porsche 911r is the 1st small step. meanwhile buy 2nd, 3rd or 4th hand cars. i have a 20 year old passat and it is superb.
your reasons and more are why, after my 1987 toyota pick up was stolen, i bought a 2002, first generation, tacoma. love it. i work on it myself, does have a lot of electrical gadgets, but fairly simple and was only ten thousand dollars it had carfax verified seventy five thousand miles, my truck has no touch screens, no distractions, just a simple radio. that's it.
yup modern cars suck. overly complicated and unreliable electronics, lcd screens that are just cheap and nasty,abs that is forever going wrong. then dual-mass flywheels that break in no time at all and cost a fortune. sumps with no drain plugs, sunroofs that don't slide open because the manufacturer deems it dangerous and no ashtrays. it's just communism on wheels.
auto manufacturers are currently being forced into a very uncomfortable place. most of them are milking consumers knowing the upcoming years will be challenging. with millennials being completely disinterested in cars, car sharing services popping like mushrooms and the advent of the elusive but inevitable autonomous car, personal cars are undoubtedly a dying breed.
back then i was making about $30,000 per year, today i'm at about $35,000 per year, so not a significantly higher wage. the thing that changed vastly is my maturity level, my ability to manage my money, and four years from now i will be, again, debt free and driving a five year old car. plenty of time to save up for my next car, perhaps a corvette next or a porsche.
i bought a 1996 honda accord and drove it for 3 years before some fuckwit texting and driving in a semi smashed it into the back right into a pickup bent the hood back and broke the radiator fan. i drove that shit 75 miles back home from my grind. same thing happened to my friends 2009 civic and it died right there. new cars are shit. semis don't drive well in cali.
i fully agree with you. also, to your #2 point, the technology is physically tied to the car in such a way that aftermarket is being squeezed out, and giving consumers less choices, and also less power in the ownership of their own vehicle. the early 2000's was the peak of products designed for the consumer to now products designed to keep the consumer wanting more.
it's these car reviewers who are constantly asking for all these things to put one cars which make manufacturers think that's what consumers want. these technologies don't belong in a car that demands the driver to be 100% focus. look these days people on their phones driving because they relying on these electronics. who needs blindspot warning or lane keep assist?
technology today is a fast moving money pit. auto mfg's today offer cars that last 200k + miles that's good, but their value runs-out well before the note is paid. that's because 40% of a cars value is tied to computer electronics. don't worry about that sticker price, the car salesman says. we'll make your monthly payments so low, you'll be embarrassed to pay them.
that touchscreen demo is what is wrong with cars these days. fresh from factory they are slow and unresponsive. fresh from factory today. how the fuck do people put up with that shit, and forget 5 years from now, it's outdated when they make the damn things today. mazda screens suck too. you can be driving down the road by the time they boot up and are ready to use.
this is a bit bias. for the younger generation the older cars are perfect for them to learn and to experiment, however when you are 60 and 70 years old you need the technology in the cars to help perform your tasks better and you don't need to know what's in the car. it goes hand in hand with your debt problem, a debt at 70 isn't a problem but a debt in your 20s is.
this is why i always buy a stripped down car. i want a car to have knobs and not screens. i always crawl under the car and see how easy it is work on. i prefer a manual if i can get one, as i have more control especially in the mountains and know how to get more mpg than the rated value. if i lived in la then i would get a cvt. i look at the total cost of ownership.
i agree about the software issue. also, the software and hardware is usually quite poor. it's slow, touch screens are unresponsive, and the interfaces are often really poor. i don't understand why manufacturers can't just stick a high-end smartphone chip inside and put a skinned version of android in there. leave it to people that actually know tech rather than cars!
ok modern gas cars break a lot and mechanical problems are expensive to fix now compare that to an modern electric car like the tesla model 3 with a price staring at 35k the car is very reliable and doesn’t break a lot it’s expensive to repair but they barely break so it ends up being cheaper then a gas car and you don’t have to oil changes and that other maintenance
the part about software updates is what bothers me the most. hope more car manufacturers will adopt apple car play and android auto and ditch the slow and ugly infotainment systems they have now. if i have a smartphone with apps for everything, why would i want to pay for another system which is slower, has less features and costs more than a regular phone or tablet?
what is nice is when you have to take the whole front end off a 2011 malibu just to install a $10 headlight bulb and older cars you could just reach in behind and do it in 5 minutes. i heard this is one of the latest gimmicks that different mans. are doing so you either spend 4 hours or pay the mechs. crazy. planned obsolescence after it gets through warranty period.
1990s rwd lexus vehicles were probably the best built cars with a mix of low tech modern stuff and reliability. they kind of went wrong in 1998 when they added touch screen nav in us models. none of them had smart keys, radar laser cruise control, apps, etc. they did have stuff like cooling fins on the diff, precision auto hvac, high power for stock audio systems, etc
diarrhea tips, lol. i want to get mid 90's accord or some other similar car that was very solid during the time. parts for any of those high selling, popular cars are so cheap now that you can just replace everything a few times over before ever coming close to the cost of a new car. i'm able to do most of the work myself so i don't spend nearly as much as some might.
jeep liberty 2012. bought lifetime warranty from factory. i wasn't making much, it was brand new with. 01 miles when i test drove it. it was $350 per month. the lifetime limited warranty cost almost 10k and i was making the lowest payments to the credit card company. i also traded my 2007 jeep liberty and i just paid it off. alot of this stuff is thinking waaaay ahead
part of the reason that i'm planning on switching to just owning a motorcycle initial cost of 8 grand brand new is easy to afford. maintenance costs are typically what i save in gas so that ends up being about the same. i don't need so much technology. give me a dash with the basic info like most manufacturers do on their mid-range bikes and a sena, i'm all good to go
the lack of computer updates for cars can also create some huge exploits. especially if the os is not updated. i’m sure it’ll take an epidemic of cars getting hacked and data stolen from phones through bluetooth. or even potential control of the car depending on how tied together the console and driving computer are before a public outcry to fix the problems come out.
they talk about car sharing and lack of private purchase. it's because they know that in 15 years, an entry level car will not exist. crash protection will be more about pedestrians than occupants. our grandchildren likely won't know what it is to drive, the midset is about to change. it's not that far away. imagine a world without racing. because we are headed there.
touchscreens in a car are just pure evil. you cannot use them without looking at them, which means you have to take your eyes of the road. which means you should not use them while driving. ok, but who waits for the next exit or the next resting area and then pulls off the autobahn, when wants to adjust dashbord brigtness or even just the heating ventilation settings?
hello, i am a fan of driving, like everyone, and follow your points. a few weeks ago i found on you tube a documentary about the history of transportation in america. i love, a streetcar named desire, marlon brando and so forth it was gm who ripped up the tramways in us cities, according to this film, thus creating a market post ww2 in the us for privater car ownership
i have an 09 civic that was built before the all the electronic junk went into the civic. now you can't get any car without all that stuff. i'm a honda guy because their stuff doesn't suffer from the trash factor of other brands so my next car will be a honda and i'll keep it for seven or eight years just like my civic and then i'll trade it for ,probably, another one!
i've been very into electronics and cars my whole life. my dad was a programmer with an rx7. as much as i love these 2 things, they don't go together. driver assistance is great, but any controls that absolutely require you to look at them to use them while driving should not be there in my opinion. i'll stick to project cars. i don't like the way new cars look anyway.
so i was in my brother's 06 scion tc that survived harvey water reached the door step and entered the car, everything still worked. all it had in the center console was ac and audio controls. nothing fancy, it still runs great, has a funny smell, but still runs. if that had been a 2018 335i that thing would have been totalled because the car's safety systems would fry.
all these things you mention are optional and cost money. you don't get all these fancy tech upgrades for free so i'm not exactly sure why you're scoffing at the price of cars that have been kitted out with technology. a no frills new car by most major manufacturers can still be had for a perfectly reasonable price but you choose not to acknowledge their existence. why?
fuck that. i want a car with roll down windows, no power locks, no power steering, manual transmission and analog gauges. which is nearly impossible to find these days. i don't even care about air bags or abs. also, learn to fix stuff yourself it will save thousands of dollars. i bought a obd ii scanner and it paid for itself 10 times over by diagnosing problems myself.
in the past 24 years i've bought 4 acura's and one toyota. sure i had to do brakes and timing belts but other than bulbs and batteries i never had anything break on either one of them.i'd like to have something cool like a mercedes or alfa romeo but i'm into buying and not leasing so unless i win the lotto i'm sticking with the honda or toyota for the next machine also.
manufacture does not want these cars to last longer then 4 to 5 years so one can go back and buy another one, i do transmissions for a living and the average cost for a transmission repair rebuild is around 3500 to 4500 dollars so that is not cheap by any means the reason is because of the technology in side the transmission consist of solenoids and all so the computer.
most of the tech in these modern cars are consumer driven we have become obsessed with always being connected via the internet, phone or laptop and the car has just become an extension of this. but i agree when this modern tech goes wrong a few years down the line, and it will, i am sure it will write off a lot of cars before they have a catastrophic mechanical failure.
and if you do insurance covers it. so there is no cost, so thats confusing. and a guage cluster for a 2016 honda civic costs $60 not $374 and when the fuck does a guage cluster go out, ive never even heard of that problem, and a 2016 fuel pump costs about $100 not $408 so this whole video makes absolutely no sense. unless someone can explain it to me, that would be great
driver distraction fiddling with the center console isn't new, safety has always been in the hands and judgement of the driver period. manufacturers can aid or hinder us with their tech, and some are better than others. but i'd wager modern systems are far less distracting once set up in fact some won't even allow you to do certain things unless the vehicle is in 'park'.
i just bought a 1997 lexus ls 400 with 97,000 miles for $3500. every single thing works. it was a $55,000 car when new. i try and fix everything mechanical myself with a basic set of hand tools, a set of ramps, and a floor jack. go ahead and buy or lease your new cars i'm putting all the money i'm not spending on cars into an ira. good luck to you when you lose your job…
ok savagegeese, make a video about how many buttons controls there are in different cars. and how many different screens. our prius has over 80 different buttons, and three different screens. what an absolute chaotic mess. then there’s the “beep, beep, beep. ” on the prius that doesn’t tell you there’s something you’re reversing into, it tells you you’re in reverse gear.
right. it's capitalism's fault. sigh. you people need to man up, choke the red-pill, watch some aaron clarey and terrence popp videos, whatever it takes. 1 don't buy a new car if you can't afford it, *ya dumbfucks*. buy a beater with blemishes for $800. 2, open the fuse-box and yank the sucker for the eyesore display. 3 this one is important learn how to left-foot brake.
you don't have to have a lexus. if you can't afford it, just buy something which is in your capabilities. that lexus costs 150,000 us$ in my country because of 130% takes, so i just drive a 25,000 us$ renault clio, and it's enough. same goes for all the techology. if you buy a lexus, that shit will bother you. but if you buy a simpler, cheaper car, it won't be a problem.
buy a used car. there's tons of good ones out there. also, don't buy a luxury car if you don't want to deal with the downsides that come with it. they're not meant to be timeless or a good value, they're meant to be a comfortable af. why would you even think a car with a turbocharger, a supercharger, and a hybrid system on a tiny engine will last as long as a simpler one?
i agree with your statement about that's how capitalism works, but you can't blame capitalism on why technology overload has infested cars. if people didn't buy these cars, manufactures wouldn't build them. obviously, technology sells. people want the latest electronics, and they want them in their cars, which is probably why my next car might be a used clunker pre 2000s.
no problem with 3d tv or led light bulbs though i would like to have the option for the tungsten but it is worrying that the tech industry next big thing is autonomous vehicles. something which has so many nasty legal implications is ridiculous to even be considered. say if a car has to decide between crashing on a wall or hitting a pedestrian. let's say, a child or a dog?
a car is the number one social status object. people want to belong to certain social circles and a car is their ticket. for me it's a tool. it takes me to work and back home with low consumption, low maintenance and reliability. it's not fast but it's fast enough and it's safe. i can still fix some mechanical problems without a degree in electronics. a 2000 opel corsa 1.2!
accept that it costs $500 per month to own a car. i have several old cars 1972, 1974, 1987, 1988, 1995, 2002, three of them are tagged & insured. some months i buy parts, other months i don't. i am diy do it yourself so my expenses are up to me. if you aren't prepared to own an old car and fix it yourself then accept that $500 per month is what transportation will cost you.
that's is so true about today's infotainment systems. if they break then you won't be able to control alot of the basic controls of you car because they are built in the infotainment. i do like how dodge does it on my challenger. you can control things in the infotainment system but they still include physical controls for everything incase the infotainment system goes out.
buy used, not enough car company competition, too many government regulations makes less competition, and research maintenance and repair issues costs. it sucks because i guarantee there would be more manufactures making basic cars that work and are cheap, but the government regulation makes that impossible. giving up freedom and better car options for safety is the problem.
capitalism means the market dictates what products and successful. in the case of both of these complaints, consumer demand is the driving factor. lower cost, less featured vehicles don't sell. if they did, car companies would make more of them. the auto industry is highly competitve that way. this video is just a whiny nerd without a good job making millenials a dirty word.
it's a little too modern for me. once upon a time, you could buy points, plugs, plug wires, condenser, rotor, distributor cap and be completely ready to do a tune-up. you could do the work yourself with nothing more complex than a set of socket wrenches andy maybe a dwell meter to set your points gap and a timing light to set your timing. if you didn't want to do it by ear .
new cars all look too bloody similar too and are bulbous and obsessed with safety this safety that, stupid pointless high profile tyres that blowout every 5 minutes and the cheapest, nastiest fabrics and plastics that make all 80s cars look totally upmarket inside and 99.99% of new car interiors are black. another boring cost cutting exercise. i weep for the future pathetic!
no need for programming with computers etc. only luxury i have is rc door locks, hvac and abs and everything is controlled by old fashion switches. my door lock remote control died when i left the keys in the rain. ordered second hand one and found a way on the internet to teach the car the new key by closing and opening the doors ignition on off etc. and in 5 min it worked!
unless you have a built in gps and most of them have and sd card slow for updating maps. idiotic point. i used to have an old nokia phone actually several before the smart phone era and none of them needed any updates an one i had for 4 years. its only apple that made phone software updates a nightmare. microsoft and android dont push as many update because there is no need!
you either hold the button in until the you reach the desired degrees, but it takes forever so you instead tap tap tap tap the button until you get the temp where you want it then you hit a bump in the road and your finger moves off the button so you then have to look down at what you're doing. remember when you could just turn a knob to cold or turn it the other way to hot?
all this unnecessary multimedia. i was so happy when i got back in my 95 2.0l ford escort. i dont need to look away from the road to turn the heat down, just reach over for the knob and turn it. simple. and the cost of repairs, oh boy, i know a lot of people who buy used new cars, and then cry in the corner when they find out that two front struts cost their whole pay check.!
and an indicator that manufacturers aren't selling these expensive vehicles is the introduction of longer and longer financing terms. such as 84 month financing on full-size pickup trucks now. because the only crowd who buys those vehicles are typically blue collar workers. whose income is slowly shrinking as inflation continually creeps up. thank you for covering this topic.
i was thinking of getting a 2015 or newer mustang when i can afford upgrading to one, but this kind of stuff crossed my mind lately. i might just get a bare bones 05-12 gt or maybe even an 07 gt500 with a 6 cd player with aux. most of the shit on the touchscreens on new cars i can do with an ok google on my phone lol. it looks cool, but i always thought it was bound to break.
why i prefer 90s cars. i recently bought a 97 accord in immaculate mechanical interior exterior condition, no leaks, no nothing. with only 108k miles on it. that's right only 108k. and i only paid $1800. literally found a gem and i'm so glad because the car is very nice and fun to drive. definitely gonna keep it until it dies on me which would be like in 20 years or more lol.
you no longer have a real choice when it comes to buying cars today. the manufacturers all seem to be more interested in who can piss the farthest than making the cars we want and need. it's a game to them. i like cars like the l-fa and sesto elemento, but if i was offered a free car under the condition i couldn't sell it, i would chose a car like the escort zx2. why you ask?
easy. i made a stupid choice. back when i didn't have much expendable cash, i bought cars typically under $2000. but then i got tired of the constant repairs and dumping repair money into a car that had already reached rock bottom value. so i thought, hey, instead of $400 per month in repairs and maintenance, i'll spent $400 on a car payment for a reliable car with a warranty!
i have been thinking of perhaps charging people $20 to $25 an hour to teach people to fix their own car. they would do the work, and i would look at it and tell them what screws to take out etc, and where to buy the parts etc. i know that a bunch of us could be doing this to help out and for us that have a bad back, but know how to fix things it would allow us both to survive.
this could be another advert for the perfectly progressing post-apocalypse agenda of blamethrower whingers who are trained to decry their own existence and build the mood of discontent about nothing in particular except for everything that is not centrally controlled and smooshable into one of the smart gulag metropolises, but i doubt a million eye-modules actually watched it.
approved. it's insane, and the deprecation of these new cars is just as crazy losing 40-50% value within the first year of purchase. also like you stated the cost to maintain most of these vehicles after the warranty ends is in the thousands when something breaks. there are lot of cars out on the market and many of them are really nice but only a handful of brands are reliable.
you won't have to do absolutely anything to accomplish this, and, in fact, ca help you reduce your stress levels as well. the simple answer is don't have a fucking family. kids are just a financial burden for you and your wallet. without kids you would have much more money to spend on things you like, or at the very least, you wouldn't be drowning in debt just to maintain them.
cars aren't more than they used to be. if you account for inflation then new cars today are maybe a few thousand more than they were a decade ago. run the numbers, i did for my wrangler rubicon, i paid about 2k more than i would have for the first model year of the rubicon. a new car will always have the cutting edge tech for its time, and you will be charged for that. and tech?
i got solutions 1- buy a used car. i bought my last one for 2500$ and it purrs like a cat. if i can run it 2 years with minimal repair, i'm in business. 2- avoid stupid tech like touchscreen. that stupid fad is done anyways car manufacturers just realized they can make more profits by creating an app for your phone or tablet. 3- buy an obd2 tool to reset your check engine codes.
some of it is nice to have, but you want to know what other owners think of it. the manufacturer’s plan to keep the tech updated particularly nav systems that need map and poi database updates, in my case the entune package from toyota was regarded as a joke. the nav component was somewhat okay, but not impressive compared to a budget priced garmin gps with lifetime map updates.
there's no reason someone in their 20's can't take out a $2500 loan and buy a perfectly decent car that will get them through school and their first few years of married life. people just need to learn to how to buy a good used car, and to learn how to maintain and repair it themselves. buy a toyota. watch a lot of chris fix videos. buy used tools on craigs list. it can be done.
all my life i've driven 80's gm b body cars. one time i acquired a 2003 honda and i think after this one i'll go back to big old carburetors. my previous 86' cadillac was very easy to fix and all the parts i needed were at my local scrap yard. for 5 thousand, you really can get a long lasting car with school level mechanics. if it fails, what's 3-5 thousand going to set you back?
cars. a necessary evil. my newest car is a 2012. no worries, no issues. i am keeping it and when the darn technology takes a crap- so be it. my other car is a 2004 my wife's and my second car is a 1997 piece of junk i drive back and forth to work everyday. i even have a cassette player in the car. before that, i had a 1976 car for over 17 years. i have no intention of buying new.
i can dig it. people need to have a plan with their money. they don't have to sign for that 80 month loan for a car. they can have an emergency fund for not if, but when their car needs repairs. i agree with you. it's rather strange that the things that distract us are being installed in our cars, not solving the problem, but making it worse. just got to make the right decisions.
i'm not agree with the cost problem you said. at the old days it was really difficult to buy or afford even a small simple vehicle, today almost anyone over some age can buy a car and maintain it with a simple job. also there are companies which are give you oportunities to buy or rent cars really easy. there are cars with small litre engines with nice equipment with good prices.
my grandma just passed away this summer. she left about $600,000 because everything she owned was paid for with cash. i got the 1991 explorer that granpa bought new and it is still like new, garaged it's whole life. point is, she never took on debt, never, and now everyone in the fam is a letter wealthier because of it. i'm the only one in the fam that doesn't take on debt though.
my rouge sport doesn't allow me to use the nav while i drive, which i thought was cool, until i had the passenger try to input the address while i drove an we had to pull over on the highway. if it can disable an enable the passenger seat airbag when someone is sitting there, it would've been nice to enable that feature for the nav so a passenger can input an address while u drive
probably won't be a problem if schools hadn't replaced auto shop class with cultural studies or economics class with you name the sensitivity classes. i have no problems with fixing, repairing, updating modern vehicles. i drive modern vehicles 2016 2017. teach your children those things that schools do not. like how to shop for a car they can afford. teach yourself how fix things.
thank goodness my 2015 mazda 6 sport doesn't have most of these things. it has no touch screen, no navigation system, no automatic climate control, no blind spot monitoring systems, no automatic transmission. the only real modern features the car has is stability control, advanced airbags, and pushbutton start. compared to a lot of other cars on sale today it is a very simple car.
tldr caveat emptor. capitalism isn't a conspiracy. auto makers make the kinds of cars people want the kind of cars the gov forces them to make. if you want cheaper cars a better place to start it repealing all the useless bs regulations that the industry is forced to comply with that result in more complicated and more expensive cars with little or no real benefit to the consumer.
i live in europe, with seriously high vat and registration costs compared to the usa, and for $40,000 i either buy a rather luxury large saloon sedan, or a hot hatch that does 0-100 km h 0-62mph in 5 seconds. new, that is. second hand, you'd be looking at a mercedes, bmw or audi. i've never liked large cars, and i don't understand why you'd need a car big enough to transport a cow.
i was all ready to purchase a genesis v8 a year or two ago until your review of it made me consider the cost to maintain some of their overly complicated components. instead i held onto the car i had, it’s now paid off and still super reliable. if i hadn’t thought about what you said, today i’d probably still be paying on a $50k loan, and as much as i drive, nearly out of warranty.
no matter what the car is, how fast it goes, how much power it has, i hate every new car steering wheel. maybe it's just me and i'm nitpicking, but i hate the big bulky ass steering wheels in cars these days. i like the smaller wheels that you can actually grip from the early 2000s down. they always say that it's for added bolstering and what not, but it just gets in the way to me.
big whop. i even managed to buy a bunch of spare-parts just before cash-for-clunkers made sure to force salvage yards to destroy them all. 150k miles later, she's finnally blown a push rod and ive spent only about additional 3-4grand on keep it running minus tires gas etc, consider the cost-of-running per mile there vs. a new vehicle so yeah, do the math of you dont belieber me. oh!
i felt the same way about number one for years now, but still wanted a toy. bought a used c6 z06 after it hit its depreciation two years ago and for a daily, i absolutely love my new hyundai elantra. can see why anyone would really need anything more as a daily commuter. not expensive, and even cheaper to lease at $159 month and then don't even have to worry about maintenance costs.
base models hondas are still relatively simple. no touchscreen infotainment systems. so giant knobs and buttons and the only technology really is bluetooth which is still the standard and probably going to be the wireless standard for years to come. if just avoid those touchscreen infotainment systems. you can still get a pretty basic vehicle and just avoid the tech laden trim levels
certain french auto trans has a hidden program it counts up to 32000 miles and then puts you into limp mode, un less you are a mech you dont know so take it to the dealer ,a diagnostic will tell them the fluid needs changing so you get a bill for £100 and odd, you can change the fluid your self but unless you have access to the special [clip] software and the right scanner your fked.
most people just lease a car instead purchasing out right. if you don't drive long distances and just use it as a daily driver with local commutes that's the way to go. though since i'm a mechanic i will never buy new when a much cheaper good used car will do the same job. even when using extra money for upgrades, replacement parts, and mods i'm still way under budget vs any new car.
my first car, a 1992 subaru loyale, i crashed it twice in 3 months within the first 4 months of owning it. both times, it was straightend, fixed, and moded to make it safer, not more dangerous as my parents saw. it's a tough car. and still brand new in a way. while my mom's new jeep wrangler, is starting to become less desirable by the month, even with no mechanical damage whatsoever
i like this video, but 1. that cars are too expensive. well, for what you get, the amazing machines that they are, the low end of the market are actually not bad value. i think we've become so blase and spoiled that we don't appreciate how good cars are these days. and then there's second hand there's really no reason to buy new, and a good late model used car is way cheaper than new.
i'll add third and fourth problems with modern cars. the crumple zones designed to protect us in a crash also make cars that can't be repaired from simple collisions anymore. then the damn sheet metal and windshield glass are so thin to save weight that they barely survive hail storms and road debris. yes, the modern materials are better but you still need enough of them to be sturdy.
if it were all voice controls then it might be a bit safer. and thanks for bringing up this relevant info on car waste and resources, but you fail to mention that car manufacturers have been conning us since day one with built in opsolescence along with most other types of modern day manufacturing from radios, tv's to most gadgets and white goods. thats why i call it all 'crapatalism'
the biggest problems with most new cars is the fact the engines are so compact, they're impossible to work on. plus the fact cars with front wheel drive completely suck because the spark plugs are in the front and rear of the engine. at least a rear wheel drive vehicle has the spark plugs available on the left and right hand sides of the engine. that's what makes new cars suck so bad.
the truth about modern cars is there is far too much control given to the creators of the machines and too much control of bullshit unnecessary optional entertainment crap given and not enough responsibiliy taken by lazy assed newer generations of people who equate convenience with deferred responsibility to technology, that is the problem with all new cars and trucks and motorcycles.
or that’s how irresponsibility works. people not maintaining their car, waiting till it becomes worse and more expensive, keep it simple stupid fewer options means less likely to go wrong. planned obsolescence. like the lightbulb business don’t want to sell you something once, they want to make money so of course the next version will be “better” ie. iphone. etc, welcome to capitalism.
right now i drive a 1982 mb 300 sd turbo diesel, for what you are actually going to spend for that 40 k car, taxes registration, insurance, and interest on the note, it's doubtful that you will actually save to buy it, but finance the whole thing, along with taking bs courses in college and borrow money for that too and then bitch you can't get that 120k a year job right out of school!
tech in cars is not about to go away, it's only going to increase. we're just at the beginning of the phase though, so of course things break and are expensive to fix. with time, however, the tech will improve, malfunction less, become cheaper to buy or replace, and be found in more and more cars. this is just the awkward beginning phase that is frustrating, expensive and a big hassle.
this guy is spot on in his appraisal of modern cars, they are a big rip off and a bottomless pit to maintain in the long run. i've had a 1971 rover for the past 10 years and it starts on the button, never breaks down and i reckon i've spent about 1,000 pounds maintaining it in this time. buy an old car, not only do you get a cool head turner but it won't break the bank in the long run.
what is disheartening is that cars are scored on the wiz bang features of the infotainment system rather than the car’s handling, operating costs etc. this happens from the car sites and the youtube car review channels alike. it seems that a majority of consumers would be swayed to the vehicle with the more infotainment features over a vehicle that was designed for long term ownership.
cars are made to be driven, some driven harder than others if you want a juke box then buy one. there's too much infotainment in these modern cars and not enough durability or reliability so, you end up with a disposable vehicle with a better than average radio. my dd is a mint condition, all original, 26 year old vehicle with 500,000 miles on it and i wouldn't trade it for 10 new cars.
in the seventies and eighties, i would buy a car for fifty dollars and drive it for a year and sell it for several times more than i had paid for it. i did this for decades. things are different now. then, when a car had 100k miles on it, it was worn out, regardless of the condition. people would get a new car at 100k miles. now a car can have 300k miles and is to some a viable vehicle.
we bought a new car but went with the base no tech model. also have the same motor in it as our last 5 year old vehicle, i sat in the luxury version of our base model and came away from it worried. climate system tied into touch, all digital dash, safety systems for blind spot and auto stop avoidance. these systems will break down sadly and i just hope i made a wise long term investment.
hm, im also a bit an oldschool and and old mechanic too. yes modern shit could be pretty expensive when it brokes and especially all thesenew fancy lights costs a fortune and you often cant fix it by yourself anymore. these popular dct trannys can went into a money grave when worn out. i stay with old torque automatic and beside a oil change after 100000km there is nothing to worry about!
i agree with the goose. my wife and i do have a genesis coupe that we really like but we also have a pristine1969 ford falcon station wagon. the coupe goes into the shop for everything while 99% of the repairs + oil changes are done at home. in 10 years i won't be able to get parts for the genesis but most auto parts stores can get any mechanical parts overnight for the 47 year old wagon.
until mid last year, we were allowed to do all available updates under warranty as we ran across them. now, there must be a provable, related complaint related to the update or they won't pay us. basically you have to wait until it screws up before we can update it now. i have to watch multiple cars every day week roll out the door with sometimes up to 9 software updates that can be done.
the car model now is set up to lease new, then they sell second hand for a reason price. very few buy new now in the uk. as you said, they are just too expensive. a normal family car is about £27k that same car in 4 years time is 10k. so lease if to u want new, 4 year old if you want to own. however if i was buying a 4 year old car, i'd be looking at one with the least tech on it to break.
the very moment a car manufacturer releases a car that has good mileage better so, electric, huge aftermarket opportunity for spare parts that work as well as original ones, good price, hardware overrides to all vital systems that are usually operated from the center console, and software updates to the computers, people will realize just about how far they're being coerced to buy e-waste.
this was a huge factor in my choosing the 2014 vw jetta i just purchased. after test driving a couple other cars that had far fancier features, the controls in the vw seemed to be much more traditional and utilitarian, which i think will transfer into withstanding the test of time much better. whatever infotainment system you were demoing during this video looked like a complete nightmare.
i love technology and advancement but the manufacturers need to give us incentive to purchase these high technology vehicles. especially when my cell phone quickly surpasses the technology in my vehicle honda wanted over $200 for a map update, why would i purchase that when my phone gps is no additional cost over my wireless plan and keeps its maps updated without asking for a ridiculous fee
i've done some thinking and talked to some peeps. and one of my peeps pointed out that car brands do update they'er software. and as for hardware. one word aftermarket there's always been a better aftermarket for electronics then factory electronics. when it comes to vehicle dashes for sure. and now with all the compatible software for apple and android i don't think it's gonna be a problem.
the tech is not the problem it's the manufactures use of insane ip laws to lock out third party repair and diy. the tech is fine but it's the ip that's the problem and lack of open standards. as for repair. well i gotta say. part of living in the 21st century is knowing how to wrench on and hack your own stuff. you have to be half grease monkey and half hacker or you'll get taken for a ride.
there is a lot more on the car that just tears down along time and there is not much sense in updating software when hardware is going to be way too old and unreliable by that time. as well as the style. yes, cars are expensive, but don't blame the manufacturers, that's the way we are. and it's not necessarily a bad thing. we will always find a way to build something better and crave for it.
completely agree with the point of infotainment systems, when you're driving and need to adjust your a c you want a knob you can feel and handle without looking. also the point of updates on those systems. not only are there security issues to be addressed, but also satnav that's build in. when you can't update the maps that are embedded in there, whitin a few years the maps will be outdated.
i am all for the safety in regards to car crashes, i love airco and heating and i like a comfortable seat with good seat belt and a reliable engine and maybe abs. really, all the other crap i do not even want. i would not even mind manual windows. also heated and like electronic things in my seat. sure i would buy them if i was a millionaire, but why is all that crap lately mandatory in cars?
i cannot find a basic new car, i don't want the gee whizzes, the blue tooth, the built-in gps. power windows ok, power driver's seat ok, but an am fm radio which 90% of the time i don't even listen too. that is why i drive a 14-year-old basic honda pilot. i have gps on my smartphone, i have a bluetooth device on my visor, i never use. give me basically a simple car that comfortable to drive.
my wife leased a brand new car she works for the manufacturer with an intelligent key, two months later the car won't start, we got sucked several times in parking lots, apparently the key sensor was faulty. they ended up giving us another car because they weren't able to repair it. i told the guys of the dealership that my 25 year old honda motorcycle has a stupid key that starts every time.
well with all the crap the dealer ads on its 3000 plus dollars on the sticker cost. who the fuck wants to pay that on top of insurance and your loan rate. went to buy a dodge minivan not too long ago sat down with the van costing around $17.000 when all said and done worked out to be around $22.000 i wondered how they jumped up so much he pointed it all out, i told him to stick it up his ass.
it has an engine, automatic gearbox, two pedals, shifter, steering wheel, five seating positions, four doors. basically it is as basic as a bash over the head and i like it. so you can keep your infotainment, i'll just open the window for shits and giggles. and if i need to know what the oil level is, then i'll pull the dipstick out of the sump and have a look at it. fucken radical, isn't it?!
the people here knocking newer cars saying oh more technology, more things to break, buy something older and it'll be cheaper to fix, it's a simple car are the ones that know they can't afford modern luxury, so they have to bash others that can. i enjoy driving something more tech worthy, and safer, and more efficient than those old unsafe dinosaurs that those people are still dragging around.
this video is stupid im sorry dude. cars are wayyyy more reliable than they used to be. you dont have to buy a new fucking car dude by a 7 year old civic and enjoy a dirt cheap car that gets the job done. technology saves lives and really isnt that bad to fix. the modt expensive things to fix are still suspension, engine, and transmissions. no one repkaces a gauge cluster on a civic cmon dude.
i want a 4x4 pickup with a v8. i can't get a new one in a base model. i don't want 4 door, carpet, stereo, sun roof, leather, dual climate control, or automatic. i will be using it for work and trail riding. if i want a v8, i have to get the upgraded packages and the cost adds up real quick. so for now, i will stick with my 99 ram. its cheaper fix what breaks than buy new. thanks for the video.
if i can't pay cash, i don't buy it. my first car 1954 was a 39 ford coupe. it was 15 years old and cost $100. my present vehicle is a 2001 blazer. no touch screen, no push button start, runs great and cost me $3000 3 years ago. it has 100,000 miles and will last forever. i agree that there is so much distraction on the dash that it is worse than people driving while talking on their cel phone.
it's true. the things are made to break and become totaled by repair bills now, catching up the germans this way. outside tesla, car companies are just garbage at integrating tech, best to avoid it all together with, but its been this way for the longest time, the integrated gps systems were always the biggest scams, expensive updates, and you are trapped with an outdated nav system in no time.
lease for the number of miles per year you actually drive and put money down only to cover the fees and 1st months payment,, sell the lease to a dealer during it's last month on the lease. repeat. avoid all of the bs. old tech, longer term maintenance, lease inspection, problems, out of warranty issues. i see bumper to bumper warranties going beyond 3 36 in the near future for more manufactures.
love this video. you are right. but there is a lot of people with money out there, for them is just easy to get another car and get rid of the car, or just lease the car and change it next year, but for people with low income i wouldn't recommend this kind of cars especially for the long run. less technology less problems. i'm talking about keyless cars, touch screens, auto parking systems, etc.
really didn't know what i was gonna think of your vid, really enjoyed it and as a gen x'er i'm very much on board with your comments. i'm a very techie guy, but increasingly i have become jaded by so much of the infotainment and camera tech in not on cars but also class 8 truck's. it's to the point that i'm even considering restoring a 2003 honda pilot. just because we can doesn't mean we should
this is why i like my old toyota. the only electric thing is the windows. manual seats, locks they are power too but if the actuator goes out big deal manual heater controls if i adjust the temperature i’m actually moving a wire connected to something. new cars are pay to play. there are still good ones out there. a 20k brand new toyota corolla will still last 200k and have minimal repair bills.
and then there's the fact that only three manufacturers offer heavy duty { 3 4 ton and 1 ton civilian trucks, while none of them have all the or quality people like. dodge and chevy don't have the right bed and cab sizes, and ford has other problems with their lineup. add this to the countless problems around the world and it makes me feel really hopeless and pessimistic. like, really, wtf world?
i raised this question with teslas where almost every major interior function is through the touch screen. what's owning a tesla look like in 10 years. had a lot of tesla owners jump on me online saying that updates will resolve any issues, but you can update all you want but things still slow down and get sluggish. no ones on a gen 1 iphone saying all i have to do is update it and it works great
i worked at a toyota dealer for almost 8 years. the most reliable cars were the cheapest. yaris, corolla, xb, base model tacoma, etc. the fancy pants $40,000+ cars were always coming back for display units. some dipshit bumped a barrier at. 005 mph in his loaded avalon and broke a $400 proximity sensor. i could go on and on. i'll never buy a higher end model exactly because of this type of stuff.
i would like to see them go back to knobs and analog buttons that you can feel for rather then take your eyes off the road to change the radio station, i see on some newer models they are moving the screen higher,acknowledging that there is a problem.i would love to see the stats of how many accidents are happening due to this issue,please when you get time can you do an update on this situation?
my 2012 car is even struggling with lack of firmware updates. it used to have avrcp bluetooth metadata support to show what song i'm listening to etc on the info screen. android has updated, outmoding avrcp 1.2, and suddenly my car has forever lost that function. what if in two years' time, android forces an update to a brand new version of bluetooth which breaks my car's audio system completely?
of watching. thanks for the intellect & you're so right. i only buy cars with knobs & buttons, no matter how new they may be. touchscreen nonsense will kill drivers in future. everything's a menu this or that & you just cannot function without taking eyes from the road ahead. the new porsche panamera has removed dozens of buttons in favour of a huge screen with hundreds of menus. it's terrifying.
only good thing that comes from all of this is that while the millennials are buying, buying, and buying newer products the old stuff are getting cheaper and more affordable. cars that still have oil dipsticks, obd2 ports, repairable parts are becoming more available to those who still appreciate it and can work on it and won’t have to go poor trying pay a monthly mortgage’s worth of repair cost.
they will keep making it, until we stop buying it. purchased new audi. no base model available. had to settle. technology package, includes advance key, and fancy automatic transmission with 4 drive mode programs. paddle shifters for manual mode. i wanted manual transmission, no technology package. but, they don't make it for the u market 4 year 50 thousand mile warranty. after that trade it in.?
work hard. live within your means. a car is a depreciating asset. save your money when young and invest in appreciating assets like shares and property. your future self will thank you. sorry but young people want it all now. i gad to sacrifice a hell of a lot when young because i wanted a better future than my parents had. now i can enjoy the good things in life and i still live wighin my means.
i have a new car, and i was literally forced by the sales rep to option satnav, multimedia etc, because he says everybody wants that and i not gonna be able to sell it again without it bla-bla, but i don't really care. i basically haven't touched any of it. and why would you miss an update to all that crap in 5 years, if you think all these toys already don't belong in to a car in the first place?
something worth bringing up, my new vehicle has a warranty that runs until it's paid off. some of the comments here might make one assume all older cars are more reliable. definitely not the case. i'm willing to pay extra for the peace of mind knowing if something breaks it's covered. i wouldn't call this video wrong, but really it was just presenting facts that backed up an individual's opinions.
this man is absolutely right in everything that he has mentioned. today's average family see's themselves forced to trade in their $40,000 vehicle for a newer one because their older one is not functioning the way it's supposed to anymore with all that push start and keyless entry and touch screen for everything. that leaves the families in a never ending debt with their dealership and their bank.
i think the touch screen is better with more knobs equals more likely to fail. i have a touch screen aftermarket stereo there's less chances of it breaking. had it for 4 years an no problems so far and it mechanical with the screen popping out for cds. my a c knob snapped had to replace the entire unit. less knobs and buttons might be better. but i still wouldn't spend 40-50k on a car i'm not dumb.
my 2016 iphone 7 connects just fine to a 2006 bmw 3 series head unit, for both music and for phonecalls. the software updates are available via the dealers when a car goes in for its service. it seems you are just insistent on being negative, used cars are always a higher risk, but any car that modern, will carry some degree of warranty and is likely to continue to be useful for many years to come.
this is why i drive a 20 year old volvo estate. it is reliable, practical and cheap to repair not that it breaks down, it easily keeps up with modern cars, has no fancy electronic brains to go wrong. also, it is paid for. as it is the last true volvo, it is an appreciating asset, rather than a depreciating one. i love it's comfort and the fact that i can go camping and sleep in the back. goodnight.
you are just cheap, sad, bald, old man with no life. yes, cars cost a lot of money. yes, they use more tech now than ever. that is why you can get 5year warranty on most cars these days. then you can keep it couple more years, sell it, buy a new one. buy a bike, ride a bus, or whatever you want. just don't complain if you are too cheap to buy something expensive. makes you look like a fckin looser.
and yet, a person that has a modicum of mechancal skills can save hundreds of dollars doing basic stuff like changing their own wipers, air filter, cabin filter, even oil to some extend if you have a place to do itetc etc etcand you can get an odbii dongle and app for your smart phone that will diagnose any dash lights you see, and tell you what the problem is and about how much it will cost to fix.
it all true what you said. but people have choices if they would give it a bit of thought. i bought a new hyundai elantra manual 6 speed and the end of the model year 10,000 canadian dollars 35 dollars a week no interest no money down buy out 4000 at the end of the lease. change oil every 500 km. i have 125000km and have never had one issue i still have the original brakes. it like driving for free.
thank you. i'm with you where there's just too much shit going on in cars, and it's baffling because of the distractions it causes. i loathe a future where simple cars are phased out and i'd eventually be forced to pilot one of these nanny-riffic irritations. i've always hated how cars will bong at you for everything. like, motherfucker, i know my keys are in the ignition, i fucking left them there!
i agree to an extent. we had endless issues with our out of warranty bmw and costs were just adding up. nothing more frustrating than faulty sensors and computers telling you you have an issue when you know whats going on with your car. in the end i sold the bm and bought a 20 year old mercedes w202 with as little tech as possible bought the car cash and never looked back. most comfortable drive too.
i generally feel like i agree with the video, but the cost breakdown between the 06 and 16 civic parts left me a bit suspicious of at least the example provided. if we take 1364 and multiply it by 1.03 to account for inflation, and repeat the process 9 more times for a total of 10 years inflation adjustment, we arrive at 1833. nearly exactly the cost of the new parts. am i doing something wrong here?
i have to agree with you. we just bought a passat as a family car. the car is full with everything thats possible at vw. technology is great but also dangerous. e.g. the big navigation, while driving you should not use it as it offers too many optins and lot of infomation, on the other had, the integration of the infotainment with the digital cockpit is a good thing that keeps you hands to the wheel.
the best car video i have seen so far. rest of the videos are just cosmetic review videos. nobody tells you that what matters is after market support the manufacturer gives you locally. so if gm doesn't have a strong network in my area i should never buy one. no support means repairs expensive and rock bottom resale value. also he is right about modern cars difficult to repair and no software update.
and there i am liking my three knobs for climate control, and separate knobs and preset-buttons on the stereo. the main thing is what's called haptics, and a lot of new cars completely lack it. a big step backwards in my opinion on an older car you can just do things by memorizing position of things and by touch most buttons have different shapes, so you don't ever need to take your eyes off the road.
i bought a $12,500 truck in the early 90's. i had a $250 mo payment. today you can buy a $18k vehicle with a modest down payment, and at today's rates the payment is still $250 month. because you can make it 5 years of payments instead of 3 and still be under warranty and the car lasts longer now. cars are cheaper, a lot cheaper, unless you start piling on features and options that did not exist then.
idk man my parents are middle class, i'm middle class and in 5 years of work i have been able to afford to buy a ford mustang gt without loans. just saved up. you must've really messed up your finances if you can't afford a 4000$ 2nd hand car without a loan, also who the fuck gets married & has children with bad financial status, that's just dumb. no wonder banks are earning so much money from idiots.
listen it's the drivers responsibility on how safe they want to drive, wether they want to pull over to go on yelp your dumb ass complained about yelp too or if they want use it while driving. overall, terrible video, now i see why you have so many dislikes, you bitch too much. if you can't afford it, don't buy it, if you're complaining that technology is getting too advanced, lol at you and go amish.
this is the reason i have a 1994 holden berlina vr. i have space its good on fuel parts are just so cheap i replaced my bumpers for $200 because i find a lot of wrecked ones. no computer or aircon or traction control or anything a modern car would come with as standard however thats a good thing because i dont have to fix anything because nothing except ware and tare on old parts goes wrong on my car.
yes but the $450 headlight led usually will outlast the filament burner by 5-15 years, some do burn out earlier but most last a lot longer, not to mention it keeps down your alternator battery drain. as well the manufacturers aren't trying to put in stuff that makes it do less so you can pay more or whatever, they do what they do on account of consumer demand over top of government regulation. etc etc
great video. you have a new subscriber here. i have driven old and new alike over that past 40 years. i like old cars because of the their simplicity. they broke down more, but were much cheaper and easier to fix and maintain. new cars are more reliable and definitely safer, but are impossibly expensive to repair when they break. the electronics are really cool but are a huge weak point in reliability.
my first and current car is a 1997 vw jetta with a manual transmission. i paid 1500 up front for it and i expect to pay about another thousand getting a few problems fixed on it. i put in a bluetooth radio, it has new struts, a new axle shaft, and now snow tires. i still have to get the exhaust manifold fixed, but after that it should be good to go. it already drives nicely even if it's a little noisy.
the “wear and tear” of the machines modern instruments is the price you pay for modern comforts and this is completely consumer driven, and requested development as the market will dictate how arcane a design should be. if there was more people fed up with modernised design then manufacturers would still build “billycarts” for people like you, but once again the market is dictating this direction also!
it is sad that many car manufacturers build their cars only for the money. they should build the cars to last and people should stop selling their cars every 3-5 years. and the cars should not be produced on such a massive scale. there are too many of them, and many are just a dissapointment, badly made, only to be sold and to take someone's money. i like my car and plan to keep it for a very long time.
now thanks to technology we can see a little light pop up, telling you that it needs attention. and you're still able to drive it, it's amazing to me how stupid your argument is in the video. this is 2016, it's no longer the 70ts were you have a brick of a car slurping 14 to 1 to get from a-to-b and rattled your ass along on a smooth asphalt road. i love old cars, hell i drive my 1996 s10 4.3l everyday!
absolutely agree with you. thats why i'll never be interested in buying a tesla with those huge infotainment screens. that infotainment system goes dead & the car is useless. i always make sure i can control basic functions like stereo, heating ac, etc. with buttons knobs. my '17 brz is a good example. knobs & buttons for all the stuff i need. i don't ever touch the multimedia screen unit, don't need it.
i buy my cars for less than 3k and run them for 3 years. it's worked out for me financially. plus i fix my own shit. i've done the math and buying a new car is way more expensive than how i do it. car manufacturers should adopt the model of old head units. make an obd2 port and power supply available in the center console, make the hole for it standard, and let 3rd party manufacturers make the head unit.
my thoughts exactly on infotainment systems. they get old fast, and like you said you cannot just switch them out because climate control, camera's are all integrated on some of these infotainment systems. though there might be some hope on the horizon with manufacturers coming out with android auto and apple car play. atleast those 2 companies will be committed in some respects on updating the software.
also, i you did make some really solid points. but you just can't compare a phone to a cars entertainment system. there's a simple solution, don't use the system while driving, and i think you don't like change because it's scary and can't accept the fact that this is new stuff for cars, so of course it's going to be expensive until we can find better and cheaper ways to produce it and have it accessible.
i'm so happy that i bought a used vauxhall astra from 2004 as my first car, cost me 2500 euro's, it's easy to fix, oem parts and aftermarket parts for this car are cheap and easy to find. it has an anti-lock braking system and a simple onboard computer that calculates maximum range and stuff but thats where the electronic gizmo's stop. i'm a young and simple guy, i dont need all that electronic non-sense.
let us highlight that quality has taken a drastic nose dive. consumers are less inclined to keep a car and manufacturers ablige by user cheaper, low quality material and selling for roughly the same cost they would place on a moderate quality vehicle. the sad part people are so whipped into shape by the industry that this and other videos will be agreed upon yet nothing will be done about it by consumers.
paying a lot for repairs to complex technology is irritating, but can be understood due to it's complexity it's the money they charge for the simple things that is an insult to the customer, i have an 09 grande punto that's worth less than £1500. it needs a new under engine cover. i was told i would need to import it from italy at a cost of £250.00 that's just the part, no fitting, for a piece of plastic!
but really, modern cars are a reflection of the degeneration of society feeling safe, comfortable and hip over feeling achievement and fun, or taking risks. the best security is your god damn brain governments literally make it illegal through insane regulations for smart middle-class citizens to own a reliable, small and light fun car. where are the modern equivalents of cars such as 1990s supras or nsxs?
from 1996 till 2016 i drove a 93 ford festiva sub-compact. from 70k to 270k miles. all repairs done myself. engine -- only the alternator went out tho i'd never do that again as was barebones --no ac-cruise-auto-p seat-p mirror-etc i might of had $4,500 into total car maintenance repairs ….now still have 2000 ford f150 new to 57k miles $26k. and replaced festiva with used 2002 ford taurus wagon 145k $2,500
all of this is part of the vast left-wing conspiracy to make cars unaffordable to the vast majority of people and force them into riding the bus or whatever mass transit is out there. of course the political and upper class will have access to cars, you'll note that this is the way it was in hitler's germany, stalin's russia, and maio's china. and my fellow amerikans, it's coming to the town where you live.
if you are buying a 'new' fully loaded family vehicle in your 20-30's that is 40k+, your are either an idiot or have 80k+ income. this video is bunk. young families should be buying 'used' vehicles till you can afford this kind expense. this dude is complaining about 'technology' and 'modern car cost' as though that is the problem. the problem is he doesn't understand economics and basic financial planning.
its hilarious how fucking stupid we all are. i mean the amount of pollution it took to create one prius is probably greater than the amount of pollution my 70 barracuda has created since 1970 and that doesn't include the hazardous wast the prius and that tesla become after there smashed but we want electric cars. we want and demand these newfangled pos cars and now here we are complaining about em. lol, wow
cars are cheap compared to college. you can spend $40k in one year or less at a college. the multiply that out by 4 or even longer with no guarantee that you’ll get a job to pay all that back. buy a used car. you can’t buy a used college education for a fraction of the cost. having said that, i agree cars have a lot of gizmos. driving a tesla is like driving an ipad. i miss driving a manual transmission car.
i love my tech as much as and probably more so than the next guy and i totally agree with you about the screens. it's just nuts how you have to take your eyes off the road to find the right icon or menu. as you say, it's no different than using a cell phone. i'm surprised there isn't more being made about this because it's obviously an issue and is only getting worse. i guess, as you say, it's all by design.
i will not buy a car that does not have a double din cavity for a standard gps cd radio receiver. i always put in a remote controlled hopefully remote-start alarm system with a jamming stereo system with amps, subs and component speakers. you can jam your internet of things spying technologies up your asses. i will keep driving my old 2008 car as long as i can. it is a basic car without the new technologies.
i wish cars were easier for us drivers to repair on our own. if a tire goes flat, i would probably watch a youtube video to figure out how to change the tire or call aaa. it would be nice if replacing a flat was a 1-2 step process. it would be cool if you didn't need any extra tools to do it and the tire just snapped in place like an extremely durable toy. it should be an easy, intuitive, fool-proof process.
just buy a basic car, i have two nissans, one a sentra the other a versa. one has roll up windows, bluetooth phone, aux, and a cd player. the other has automatic windows, bluetooth phone, aux, cd player, and sport and economic modes. no touch screens, and basic sensors for the engine. i knew i wouldn't want to pay a ton of money to fix either of them, and that i can work on them without messing something up.
the problem with the capitalism?!, if you want you can become socialist, go and live in a socialist country and see if you can get half of the things that you've got. you're not happy with the system, so i invite you to try and live in a socialist country and you'll get mad not for all of this, but for not having how to buy a car. at least you've got things that people in socialist countries will never have.
ughhhhh, i can afford a 45k no problem and i'm 21. i just started working at an early age and saved. i could buy 2 of them if i wanted to without obtaining any debt. but i wouldn't buy a family car because theyre far too big and the only way i would get a car that big is if i had 6+ kids, a small simple 4 seater suffices for family who have as many as 3-4 kids and a larger 4 seater suffices for up to 5 kids.
voice control, so you don't have to remove your hands. the tech in the car isn't going to be an issue. they give a few features, but the core stuff backup camera, radio, bluetooth, ac control dosn't need to be updated, most people are using their phones as the brains for everything they are doing. i'm not even a car guy. but i did just had to buy a car because some idiot rear-ended me and totaled my old one.
you whinny ass entitled little piece of shit. you and your useless generation of self pity lazy millennials are what’s wrong with this country. if you can’t afford the car you want get off your ass and work harder. if you can’t afford the place you “deserve” to live in get off your ass and work harder. i fire idiots like you every day and it makes me sad that your generation is as fucking useless as you are.
another thing is before the 2000's, auto makers used many of the same parts for many of their vehicles. same headlights, switches, shifters, etc, etc. almost all the same parts across their line-up, for like a decade before moving on to another style. mass producing these parts made them cheap cheap cheap. now, every car seems to have unique parts. which makes them limited in quantity and much more expensive.
safety and technology costs money. there are plenty of perfectly safe and functional family vehicles that cost under $30k, even under $25k, but you have to be willing to accept fewer luxury options. properly maintain and don't abuse your vehicles and you can avoid costly repair bills. if you're not satisfied with the current offerings from auto manufacturers try using public transport. convenience isn't free.
supply and demand. if people didn't want this crap, car companies wouldn't be trying to sell it. there are plenty of cars out there with traditional console setups with regular knobs and buttons. people can still buy those and if they bought drastically more of them than these ones with screens for everything, the cars with screens would sit on lots and rust and cost them money and they would stop making them.
especially the electrical its crazy im learning it little by little i have a 2000 model suburban 17 years old and still has quite a bit of computerized things i had an issue and lost spark on all cylinders insted of checking for a bad distributer its all computerized so finding the problem becomes much more complicated and complex checking voltage and sensors and things like that lots of time with a multimeter.
glass cockpits are great for airplanes where there's not much to hit up there in the sky. i mean, collisions between aircraft happen, but not that often. glass cockpits have no place in cars. give me the old style radio with the knobs and buttons that i can control by feel while keeping my eyes on the road. having the radio controls and everything else on a screen that you have to look at makes no sense at all.
he's exactly right. they keep putting new untested electronics in cars and no way to update them or even fix them. never keep a car past it's warranty period. especially german, italian and english cars. someone should be working on how to by pass these systems when they fail and are to expensive to fix. and just wait until these 4cyl cars with dual turbos putting out 350 hp start to blow up. it's gonna happen.
hey man, i agree. i have a 2011 bmw e92 335i. so wile the car is getting old, i m thinking about upgrading to 435i 640i 2016 but like you have said. for the about same amount of power to get the newer model after selling mine, i still have to come up with 20.000. and all of the sistems are getting more and more electronically interconnected with a probably lower lifespan. please do a follow up of this video tnx
i have a 2000 model ford fairlane from australia, was a$73000 new, i bought it with 180,000km in 2014 for a$3000, v8, leather interior, cruise, climate control, i have an external gps, bluetooth stereo, it has never missed a beat and cost $124 for a service and about $180 for tune up, entire exhaust $600, and you can still feel the road when driving, 8l 100km. i will never buy a new car, hired a few, hated them
progress. society can keep their modern cars, i only want old restored cars. some people who drive these modern cars look down on me for driving an old analog car even without abs, electric windows and power steering but i can fix it all myself, they can do nothing but pay a fortune to get their cars fixed without learning anything. car manufactures today don´t want us to understand or learn anything, only pay.
that's why you get a car with as little tech. as possible. hell i want a stinger gt or wrx. i know they have a lot of tech, but when that shit starts to fault i will just take it out. the car will be paid off and it'll be mine. so might as well do whatever i want with it. hell replace the stupid push button start with a turn key ignition. a couple of grand worth putting down up front. touch screen doesn't work?
the worst part about modern appliances, whether they are in our homes or the ones we drive, is the fact that no matter how expensive the appliance is most manufacturers choose to use the cheapest tactile switches they can get. you know. the kind of switches that when you peel off the plastic top layer on an appliance's printed circuit boards you find those small triangular clicky switches made of stamped metal?
the software updates are a big deal, and one of the reason's tesla's are so attractive. tesla actively works to make the car you already own, better. they even make updates to the system that controls the motor, giving car owners more driving features. nissan in contrast, doesn't update anything. it's bullshit. at the very least they should open source the code in their head units so people can make them better.
we need a new people's car. no fancy gadgets, not tcs, no blindspot shit, no self-driving junk, no screen with 50,000,000 different functions and as little power whatever as possible. just an engine, four wheels, only basic safety stuff like abs and airbags and manual everything. keep it under $10,000 so that poor people can buy a new car and not a second hand one thats full of the previous owners bodily fluids.
friend of mine has a 2015 toyota tacoma. that tough off road monster was taken out because the heated seats malfunctioned and the computer wouldn't let the car start unless all features including the heated sets were working, with a fuse. this is how manufacturers kill your vehicle. could you imagine being stuck with the choice of tossing the brand new car or fixing thousands of dollars worth of useless features?
these are the main reasons ill never buy a new car again. why spend 40k on a new car that you cant even do basic maintenance on yourself anymore, when you can buy a totally redone 60s car that you can actually work on yourself and if you decide to sell it, you will likely get back more than you paid for it. plus im hard pressed to think of any new cars now-a-days that havent had some sort of a recall. no-brainer.
excellent video and so true. why are things allowed to be manufactured and integrated into the automobiles that are against the law and more importantly creates a potentially life threatening situation. you'll get a ticket for holding your phone in front of you and using it, which i agree with. but it's ok to look down and to your right and change the radio or ac on a touch screen. makes absolutely no sense to me.
1st if you can't afford a new car, then you buy used. 2nd as much as you feel like you need an suv, 90% of the people don't. 3rd don't feel so entitled. the problem with modern cars isn't that the price is too high for you to buy one, it's your expectation that you should be able to buy a car like that. if you can't buy a car worth 42 thousand, then buy one used for 15 thousand or even less. most will do just fine.
savagegeese, great review and a solid critical analysis of the car industry. don't let those dogmatic folks like thomas rock stop you from this badly needed commentary. they are so ideologically committed with their stop blaming society rhetoric that they become nothing more than cheerleaders for the industry. really, to show how the car industry keeps us locked into perpetually buying new cars is to blame society?
this is why i love my 2007 honda accord last model year of 7th generation and its simplicity compared to modern cars. there isn't much technology ex-l without navigation, but there are still a hint of creature comforts heated leather seats, dual climate control, led taillights, xm satellite radio, but no touchscreen or gps. no backup camera, parking and lane keep assist sensors. not much to distract me from driving
u should visit singapore sometimes in the future u will realise you could buy 1 x mx-5 nd here but u could buy 4-5 in other countries. or even buy 3 and make it faster than super car + full carbon exterior interior + cf rims + tons of oils for the car to be service till u die. the best part u could keep your car till u die in singapore u can only keep it for 5-10yrs or else u gonna pay another sum of money 50k-????
have a 2015 bmw f20 lci and my scren doesnt have touch but it has voice control which is so nice for navigation and pretty intuitive buttons for media control so i dont really have to look on the screen and the climate control is automatic so i dont have to bother about that neither. the only thing that will make a problem for me is the climate if it breaks but the rest is no issue since i can fix electronics myself
i've never understood why they don't just have a car with a lightening microusb port where the infotainment system should be and just have people put their iphones android phones in there to power the car. i would be hard pressed to find anybody who would not prefer such an easy solution instead of the crap infotainment systems the put into these cars. literally i have never seen one that works better than my phone.
in case of a frontal collision at 30mph with an old car you replace the bumper and maybe the lights and the front grid with recent car everything is dead bumpers lights radiators hood fenders and all the interior airbags destroy dashboard, roof and seats. seat belts pretension need to replace all of them usually a recent car in this condition is not economically repairable it will cost more than the price of the car
this is probably why all my cars are 15 years old or older. that said, you really don't seem to understand the basics of economics. car companies put all that stuff into cars because customers want it, not to create problems just to sell solutions. that doesn't many economic sense. you are hanging all of the responsibility on auto manufactures and none of it on the people who ask for this stuff with their checkbook.
he's actually bang on with his explanation. my father owns a garage and confirms his statements. too much technology and too many compromises at too high a cost. fuel prices are so high now as well. the build quality just isn't there and neither is qc these days it seems. it's the reason why i never tried to go into mechanics. the ever going tussle between dealerships and independent mechanics does not take my fancy.
its great for mechanics, they will either get your money to repair it or buy it at a huge discount, fix it and resale it back to you or your children. modern cars are designed for the warranty period, 3 years max, after which, they become a money pit. if you're buying used, just remember that less is more. there is a reason why that 80,000 bmw is now selling for 12,000. go ahead and buy it, and you will find out why.
one other thing is the brake and gas are too close together leading to accidents. if you can't fix it and you are not wealthy you should not buy it. school is a bigger scam than cars, at least with a car you can see if you look closely the mess that you are getting into before spending money on it. most of the stuff itemized at 3 minutes is not needed for the car to run, and can be substituted with lower cost things.
you basically couldn't drive the car. it'd randomly rev itself, shut itself off. you'd think the computer was bad. or someone put something in the motor. but just that little sensor past the catalitic converter, did that. you can get a nice family vehicle, without spending top dollar. base model subaru crosstrek, very fancy ride in my eyes, that'll do all you'd ever need. 21,600$ for a brand new all wheel drive ride.
don't blame capitalism. blame steve jobs and elon musk. they have made the touch screen and all this modern design to be cool and hip and the manufacturers are scared tesla will take their sales so they imitate them. their plan is to eventually have all cars owned by third parties like uber and then we'll just pay them to use it. i don't want that at all. i will keep my own car and drive it myself as long as possible.
i’m not gonna disagree with the points made but to say “modern cars” which when i first saw implied to me all modern cars, is a bit misleading. not all modern cars are full of technology, you can still get a cheap new car that doesn’t have all of the technology. and to be fair if i was to be sold a car for $40,000 i would expect it, if it didn’t have it i would just say it was a rip off. good video nonetheless though.
it doesnt help that mechanics dont fix cars anymore. they just replace parts. not saying that is easy but back in the day they use to actually fix broken things with minimal or no new parts. i had an ac problem and after getting a 1500 dollar quote to fix it i went with out for a while then i looked on line to see if it was something i could do my self. it was. it took me 2 hours and 20 bucks worth of tools and parts.
my toyota is ok with the tech. regular power options, infotainment is just for nav, audio, and bluetooth. climate control is separate. does have push button start which i'm not sure if i like. no crazy sensors around the vehicle. i don't feel i am that incapable of driving that i need all that safety tech shit. backup camera is a good simple technology. the tech will become old yes, but if is functions well who cares?
the elephant in the room is that they want your car to die outside of the warranty time limit so that you have no choice but to replace it with another new car, the keyword obsolescence bad for the biosphere good for the manufacturers
with every new model year car manufacturers have always put new gadgets in and made changes to keep the public coming back to buy more. all the gingerbread electronics you see now in cars is just a continuation of that practice. although some of it does not make sense, this kind of marketing does work and so it will continue until the price of a car becomes so expensive people simply cannot afford to buy them anymore.
your best bet is to buy something 7-10 years old for sum 5k. get a pre-purchase inspection always. if the car needs a few thousand in repairs include that in your purchase budget. even if you drop another 5k in repairs you are sitting at 10k invested with a solid running car vs 40k on a new car. i think people buy new for a few reasons they want to impress somebody. they think they won't need to fix it for 7 years lol
i've said for years with engine technology not changing much in 20 plus years there should definitely be a bare bones car option out there. there's really no reason for a car to cost 30 grand if you exclude all the dumb features cars come with these days. i'm imagining a band new car with everything you need to drive safely as the base model that could start in the 
maybe the problem is that it's so gimmicky and software dependent that it might need updates. transportation doesn't need an update. comfort doesn't need an update. utility and convenience never change. ergonomics, safety, tactile feedback, and a classy, durable, holistic design that doesn't involve yelp get thrown out the window when we're adding electric motors we don't need, digital menus in moving vehicles. *yawn *
car reviewers, who shall not be named, constantly bitch and moan if a car still uses a key or doesnt have key less entry that is one of my biggest tick i've seen watching multiple reviewers on different vehicles that don't have that feature or something like a 12 in ipad like radio system in the car. yeah no wonder there's like + 80,000 cars and trucks that are not even close to being super trucks or cars what have you.
i live in germany and drive a lada niva, these cars are around for ages now but since this is a 2009 model its has to have certain electronics packed into it due to specific laws we have over here. fixing those electronics cost nearly 1000€ when they stoped working. apart from that regular parts for it are realy cheap and since its a russian built car you can work on everything by yourself in the garage with some tools.
i love my young audi 80 b4 from 1992. it is so great just to drive a semi carburettor. it has a lot of problems but it just drives and works even with them. i do a lot on it myself, because i can. i hated sitting in modern honda, hyundai, fiat. all of it. there is nothing i like. i'm 23 and i just don't like a lot of modern things. even smartphones are more in my disliked list. i use it but only around 10-20 min. a day.
i would say most couples have between 1 and 3 kids, all of which a sedan can hold if you had to carry all 5 people at once for dinner night. if you can't avoid the advancements in technology, at least stop letting them sell you products by making you think you need them. only go to a dealership or sales website with what you know you need your car to have, and you'll find yourself a lot harder to get cheated in the end.
it's not the technology in general that's a killer specifically it's the electronics technology that is out of control. i'm rocking an 06 azera and have no intentions of getting anything newer. as an automotive technician i am completely uninterested in electronics taking over my vehicle. the first gen azera has enough bells and whistles while keeping electronic tech to a minimum which in my opinion is how it should be.
modern cars are more reliable than cars have ever been. you are looking at the past through rose coloured glasses. car maintenance and repair costs, especially for critical functions needed to drive the car, are really cheap. cars seem expensive because wages have been flat for the last 3 decades. adjusted for inflation, they are a much better value today. they do cost a bit more, but they run reliable for a lot longer.
big problem in cars i m from europe bosnia and herzegovina if aanyone know where is it is that 90% ppl that i know had problem in turbochargers, fuel injectors and clutch set, its to expensive indeed, before they make headlights from glass and now from plastic and its more expensive, wtf from when is plastic expensive then glass, they just making car with more tehnology to take more money from ppl even if u dont want it.
i agree i was a master toyota master tech also ase master tech since 1982 modern cars have been building in distractions into the cars for the most part you have to have to have to have blind spot monitors because you can not see any thing around you total garbage i live in upstae ny and have a 1999 toyota camera plus two jaguars 1987 xjs coup and a 2003 xi8 and have had no problems i would not buy a car built after 2010
i like new cars but love my 99 plymouth breeze. it's modern enough and isn't horrible to fix. i do my own oil changes and brake replacements at home anyway. all this new tech and people still can't don't drive properly. of course new cars are efficient but all the computer tech is more to fix and expensive costs. also all new cars seem to look the same and borrow designs. another reason for older cars. anyway end of rant
i too have issues with touch displays in cars especially with dreadful performance like this. it baffles me how huge car manufacturers build those car with incredibly complicated mechanical electrical electronic systems yet they don't seem to think twice about shitty infotainment systems, which easily distracts any kind of driver, truly strange. can't make a proper touch interface, keep the physical buttons and switches.
people who love new cars and adore technology deep don't really like cars they look at cars as nothing more than a whitegood, a kettle or microwave on wheels that is disposable. they fall for the marketing gimmicks and useless technology masquerading as useful features. new cars are not durable nor last long at all, and people accept this now. car last 4 years oh you got a good run out of it people think no. that's crap!
well some manufacturers ofer 5, 6 or even 7 years worenty. some cars selers even give you 8 years waranty if you servise car regulary in thers car shops. so ther is a option for people who are woried about that. ther is smal print to read in contracts but ther is a lot of opcions ford 5 years, kia 7 years, opel 5 to 8 years, vw, škoda 6 years. so you can get a nice car up to 22.000€ and it will serv you for 6 to 8 years.
i have a 2011 camry, the last year production before they started adding infotainment systems. just turned 113k with no problems. it has a non interference engine with a timing chain. if i were to buy a car today i think it might be a kia rio. kia is a sister to hyundai. the rio has 6 speed tran no cvt. high quality steel for safety and minimal electronics. basic transportation and upkeep. if not that, a base model civic.
lease. on a 40,000$ car you can easily find a lease for 350$ a month for 36 months therefore in one second you can solve both his first 2 problems 1- monthly cost is half of what he says for a lease instead of a 60 month finance 2- you get a brand new car in 3 years for the same 350 approx payment generally you don’t need to fix a car in first 3 years. why anyone finances a car today is beyond me this video is very stupid
modern vehicles are not only overpriced but they look hideous and ugly as well. i have a 96 ford f150 with 5.0l windsor v8 with 203,393 miles on it and it's still going strong. the only thing i replaced on my truck was the starter but other than that most of every thing else was simple maintenance and cleaned out the transmission fluid just to get rid of the shuttering it was making and it hasn't had a problem ever since.
most new car are based on fwd technology. even many awd 4×4 cars are built like fwd cars. replacing the clutch often means lifting the entire engine out of the car just because the transmission is placed in a difficult location. 8-12hour work to replace a cheap clutch isn't economical. on many old rwd cars you could replace the clutch in less than 1 hour, without removing the engine or the gearbox completely from the car.
most of the stuff people are complaining about is the government mandated crap that the feds demand the auto industry puts into modern cars. plastic dashboard, huge steering wheel, a dozen explosive airbags, complex computer controls for emissions and braking are all things that the government forces unto the industry. the touchscreens and crap are just marketing wank, just put in so the sales guy can say this car has it.
they're of poor quality and loaded down with electronics that will fail within the first 4 years and are designed to last only 8-10 years. while they are markedly safer than my older hunks of iron i usually buy, they rarely last 100,000 miles without some major malfunction. i've owned cars built in the early 70s-mid 80s that had better build quality and less problems and i beat the living shit out of them. $40k for a car?
two words reliability abd standards. the first speaks for itself. the volvo is notorious for software issues. you shouldn't have to reboot your touch screen to get the climate control to work. next, standardization. right now there're only two major choices in phone o s, android and apple. pick up any phone, and you'll know how to use it. why are drivers required to swipe through screens while driving to turn the heat on?
another thing is that, with all of those wonderful newfangled 'lectronical doohickeys al being built these days as a single unit, it's almost cheaper to buy a brand new car if your stereo cuts out. since your stereo is now completely integrated with multiple completely unrelated systems like heating and a c, gps, backup cameras, etc., when anything goes, it all goes. remember when the a c blew, you could still get to work?
i am acutely aware that i have purchased my last internal combustion engine. besides this the car i have has been altered to meet euro emissions standards that it is i think now false advertising, as i have a 2.0 diesel tdi audi that has poor throttle response it behaves and drives like a 1.6 tdi. sadly and it pains me to say this most of us are now being swindled if you are purchasing a diesel car manufactured after 2014.
i drive a beat up 91 dodge d150 its first gen. so fun working on it and getting it mint. but all those fancy things in a car that even my own family lose their shit for. when im in the car it just doesnt feel like a car anymore. they are so hyped on the electronics and nonsense they cant even see themselves without it. id rather have my beat up truck making 0 payments on. than 1000 dollars a month car+insurance in some a b
manufacturers haven't decided to bloat their car with that shit, the us government has. no one wants half the bullshit all cars are now required by law to have. safety laws are why you have so much less visibility in modern cars, since they are now have to be able to support the entire car's weight if it's upside down. i think it's by 2018 that every new car in the us is going to be required by law to have a backup camera.
personally, i won't waste my money on something with gimmicky, distracting, unnecessary, and unreliable technology built so deeply into the car that i cannot change, replace, or repair it without taking it to their guy and paying out the ass even more for something i hate. i want a car, not an ugly computer on wheels. unfortunately, that all means i can't be happy owning almost any car that is younger than i am 1984, btw .
some people need to reevaluate life. im 21 and i currently lease a brand new e300 and yea it's expensive but i can easily afford it given my job. and i also dropped out of high school. so no you don't need college to get a good job. remember life isn't what you know it's who you know. as long as you've got good work ethic and you aren't lazy you'll make it anywhere in life. just my two cents. thanks for reading if you did.
the biggest problem with modern cars is you feel so disconnected from the road when driving. not only sound insulation making the world outside the car feel completely distant, but electronic driver aids coming between you and the actual mechanical physics of what the car is doing. my '95 celica may lack the performance of many newer cars, but it is so much more fun to drive although i would love a little less turbo lag! .
so long story short, the less tech i have in my car right now the happier i get. i also recently fell in love again with a dinausor, and there's so little tech in it that i still even have to turn the key to start it. nothing but the essential manual transmission, billstein suspension, brembo brakes, awd, a good old engine delivering 305 hp, comfortable seats, nothing else, makes me smile every single time i take the wheel.
yes, it is called planned obsolescence. that's how capitalism works. make it shiny, and blind them with the latest in must have gadgets, but above all, make sure it will fail within a certain time frame. it must either be repaired at a hugely inflated cost, or replaced with another unit designed to do exactly the same thing. it's not just cars though, it seems that most of the things we buy, are designed in the same manner.
most of the technology in the car is for used before putting in drive and to help you before you get yourself get on the road. people chose to illegally use this stuff on the road to distract themselves because they don't give a crap about anyone, but themselves when on the road. especially when they use their touch screens and talk on their cellphones, but don't use turn signals when switching lanes and cutting someone off.
this is the dumbest video i've seen about cars to date. #1 reason cars are getting more expensive compared to years prior is not because of the stuff being put into it. it's because what cars we being sold in the 80's 90's and early 2000's we're matched income of an average consumer. also its competition you idiot. also up keep is dirt cheap if you doing stupid retarded crap in your car. repair of mirror who breaks mirrors?!
3 regulations regulations about lights and bumpers etc, help determine the shape of vehicles taking away creativity from designers. regulations about mandatory safety equipment that isn't guaranteed to be safe, makes cars very heavy. regulations about emissions ruin horsepower and fuel economy. all of these make cars more expensive, more bland, less efficient, and sometimes less reliable and more expensive to repair maintain.
correct so true, excellent video, you've read my mind. and they lobby the government as well to ban old cars based on noble missions, on the surface, like reducing pollution, when in fact a lot of the electrical energy comes from coal burning. and they let miners get their job on no problem. so sad that this video will change nothing, but at least there are people out there to acknowledge the sad state of affairs we are into.
every single car you see was bought new by somebody. i'm nearing retirement age and have bought new since 1977 when i got out of college, they may appear to cost more but if you keep your new car new and maintain it well then the slight increase in overall cost is always worth it. if everybody bought used then the world's automakers would all fold. it's funny that we buy about 15 million new cars a year if it is so illogical.
i honestly think touchscreens and all that infotainment is going to be banned from being put in new cars soon. deaths from distracted driving are way up because of them and stuff like that tends to not be ignored by safety regulators having to look at a touchscreen to turn up the heat even because you can't feel it vs moving a knob or slider that you can feel without taking eyes off the road for example is a huge distraction.
my car is from 1987, and i've been laughed at so many times by people that were still in the rush of having just bought a new car, but i've seen this rush flip to a negative one sometimes as fast as a few weeks. my father in law had two complete disasters of new cars, and told me he wished for something as reliable as my old banger. i can't understand people are so stupid to fall for the most options trap over and over again.
please, at least pull over, when using the touchscreen of your your car. everything else that you touched on, in this vid, i agree with. also, in my beat chevy prizm, i can put my gps under my viewing area of the windshield, and it's nice to just glance at the screen for my next turn, even before the gps narrates the turn. in a modern car, a glance to the gps screen, and potentially take your eyes off of the road, completely.
a point i'd like to throw out there are these engines. and the push to direct injection turbo. i have one and love the punch of acceleration, but there isnt enough knowledge on how to deal with these engines, especially at the dealership. they maintain service intervals that are for na engines. and i think this puts alot of owners at risk of testing their warranties or worse, finding themselves with issues outside of warranty.
car longevity. it depends on how long you define as long term investment, this is why people do research on reliable cars. you don't buy a bmw or audi expecting the car will last you for years. the well known japanese brands, however, produce really great cars that will faithfully get you from a-to-b for quite some time i have had mine for 10 years, and most of those cars have pretty good resale values due to their reputation.
my car is a 1996 vs commodore wagon, i have put on nuvo 850 which has lane departure, crash mitigation, front rear cameras with gps, i have a rear view mirror clip on with 2 reversing cameras, tyre pressure sensors gps, new carpet, usb charger in centre console, led lights all around except headlights, touch screen android radio with wifi built in gps etc and more, i put them all on in myself and it didnt cost me $45000 ¡¡¡¡¡¡
america has started a roller coaster for her people and the world. it is unbridled capitalism. the high cost of commodities and services only makes wealthy wealthier and ordinary people poorer. most modern technology is beyond the use and understanding of ordinary people. most of it is frivolous and wasteful. look at the shelves of supermarkets shit multiplied by shit ad infinitum. how many shelves are filled with potato chips?
if and i stress if i could option a car the way i wanted instead of the way they want you to buy it i would buy one more often than every 19 years or so. i would option it with an auto transmission, power steering, manual controls, crank up windows and a radio period and fuck all the touch screen crap and auto everything i do not want and should not come in cars as it is making the roads a very unsafe place. fuck car companies!
of course, but you don't need to. and the new corolla is a far, far better, safer, cleaner and more feature-rich car than that one from 1985. stick to complaining about infotainment options for cars, but you are off-base if you are complaining about car prices today because no one is forcing people these days to live above their means. they've just been brainwashed by the media including your channel into thinking they have to.
meh. most of your points i agree with, but using yelp on your car while driving is up to you as the driver not the car or manufacturer. i mean, people ran into other people tuning their am fm radios in 1990. also, most of the cars i've seen my own vehicle included have many analog controls to coincide with the touch screen controls. i think auto makers are realizing people still want analog for a lot of the more basic functions.
i warned of ever increasing technology and the associated costs back in the ‘80s as an electronics engineer for oldsmobile. they practically ran me out of the department. they do it because it’s cheap. soft controls and digital interfaces save the manufacturer huge amounts of money in production and offer perceived value in the consumer’s mind. in addition, engineering obsolecence is much easier to implement now than ever before.
international banksters have been screwing the american tax payer for 100 years now. they control the money, debt, and inflation and rob us at every turn. my dad built our family a very nice 3 br 2 bath custom home in a nice neighborhood in 1960 for $35,000. we had 2 cars and mom stayed home and raise me and my sister. modern cars are electronic crap built to last about 2 years before they start to disintegrate. technology sucks.
you have to factor in the buying power of the us dollar. it's gone down tremendously. if you take the sticker price of cars from the 1970s-1990s and adjust them for inflation. you'll find most of the 70s-90s prices would be the same if not higher than if you were to buy the same car today new. the one thing i do agree with you is the more electronics in the car makes it distracting, harder to learn, and more expensive to maintain.
comprehensive analysis around those two issues. for the second, just like for any technology, a lot of effort is to be done to improve the quality. the issues like no updates to software are being changed now. thanks to tesla and the fact that the autonomous vehicles will remove the humans from the equation will mean that these problems would change. bigger problem then would be similar more tech introducing it's share of problems.
dude i totally agree. i work at a mercedes bmw volvo porsche volkswagen dealership shop. the technology is so imbedded and once it fails that’s it. the volvos are the worst. like you said everything is hubbed in the giant screen and you wouldn’t believe the cost to replace it. they only work half the time. at least mercedes and bmw have control knobs and buttons but even those wear out. mercedes does offer software updates however.
the biggest problem is the technology and expense that's essentially mandated by governments. this makes what could be an affordable vehicle hideously expensive. fortunately, i drive a car that's relatively simple, having been built in 2002 with cost-of-ownership in mind. i feel like i'm screwed when it goes to hell, because i can't buy a new one just like it. i wasn't expecting to like this video, but it was a breath of fresh air.
this video is pretty much whinning. i agree with the parts that cars are expensive. on the other hand, you can buy cars under 20k. that's what i do. i just need something to take me from point a to point b. on top of that, i've been driving my own cars since 2007 and i never ever had any problems with them. outside basic maintenance that i don't even do at the right times, i haven't spend a single dime. the rest of the video is bs.
but i digress. if the populace didn't want to buy such vehicles, then they wouldn't buy them, look how long the edsel sold for. 17 years i've been in the car business, and i see plenty of people that choose not to buy something due to cost. so blame the fed, their mandates for safety and the manufacturers for loading up vehicles with useless shit and brainwashing their clients that they must have 309 cameras to watch whilst driving.
that's why i bought a 1998 subaru forester. it's right at the threshold of having many modern features. but all mechanical controls. which don't really go bad on you. 280k miles and 16 years later. i'm still driving the same car. sure i've had to replace the wheel bearings and c v joints. the catalyst system failed on me. and my radiator needed replacing. but i did all the repairs at my house because it was easy to do on older cars.
basically anywhere in the work, except in usa, west-eu, 90% of cars are older than 15 years. that's the sweet spot. cheap, easy to repair, not much to break, good consumption, comfortable, fast. why on earth you need better can than a 2002 5 series bmw. it cost next to nothing, fix it up for 2000$ and you can drive it for 2-3 years without touching it and it's 100x more comfortable, quest, nicer than any new kia that cost 10x as much.
this is why i've only bought bare bones vehicles. previous vehicle 1996 dodge dakota, 4-cylinder, 5-speed manual. current vehicle 2006 ford f-150, v6, 5-speed manual. neither vehicle had cruise control. and i don't need cameras, my eyes and mirrors work fine. i don't need gps, my phone has that. i don't need an automatic, both my legs and arms work fine. all of these new features are just making people more lazy and dangerous drivers.
total bullshit how much unneeded shit is them anymore. and yes, no software support from the manufacturer in the way of periodic updates. hundreds of pounds of wiring to go with shit too. and in my opinion, all of this is designed to distance frpm the facts that it averages only 17 mpg and your loan payment is $1000 month. i have a '67 plymouth barracuda, 100% pure stock, with a 225ci 6-cyl, and it averages 18mpg and its 5p years old!
idk man. i disagree. sure the technology makes it expensive but even then, it’s cheap compared to how much people in the past paid for the basics newer cars have. was just watching a video with doug demuro, and he reviewed this old aston martin that today would cost over 300,000 adjusted for inflation. it had nothing on my chevrolet cruze that i paid 20,000 for out of pocket. no payments. precisely cause i don’t want long term payments
its against all common sense to have certain touch screen functions operational while the car is driving. you would think the manufacturer would make it like that. the cars focus should remain a means of getting around from point a-to-b safely instead of trying to turn them into an entertainment center to distract the driver. the next thing you know, they will try to integrate social media into your car so everyone knows where you are.
after watching this, i was concerned that my newer modern car would have an expensive infotainment system. no worries, the 2015 honda civic touch screen stock stereo touchscreen is only $300, and the install takes about an hour. also, my local auto mechanic just updated the software for me for free, it works much better now. if it fails one day, i may even get a better aftermarket one on cruchfield, and install using some youtube help.
i agree that cars can be expensive. but this lost of yours, and the reasons you give are pretty mediocre. a big reason for adding intuative apps to a touch screen in a car is so you can find your location and navigate to it without using multiple devices. it's not designed to be used while driving, no stereo is. sensors and back up camera are all options on most vehicles, and if you really don't like them. don't fix them when they fail.
i've said to many people that vehicles are the downfall of the middle class. add up how much you spend in vehicles and maintaining, insuring, storing, etc. said vehicles over the course of a lifetime. the lost investment income is easily in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. there's where all your money went. i see single family-sized homes with 5 or more cars out front and i just shake my head. hey, it's your money. just my 2 cents.
if that happened to me in the dealer's lot before a test drive, i'd open the door and get out in disgust. new test drive plan let me figure out the radio and hvac before putting the car into gear. if i can't do it the first time by myself in less than five minutes i'll be generous here, i'm not buying the car. gonna watch your 2017 civic video next because i'm nearly in the market again. i'm a little nervous about what i'll see, though.
when i am forect to replace my 2007 vehicle when it become more expensive to repair than the car is worth then i will begin searching for a car built back in the 70s. i don't give a fuck about gas. the money i save on repairs and upkeep will more than pay for the extra gas and i will also learn how to fix a lot of problems myself. cars from the 70s were actually possible to fix in your garage. i do not need a fucking computer in my car!
whilst you have certainly a point about costs. it seems to me you dont have a clue what the reality is for. as an example the average european., when talking about car costs. if all taken into consideration. including buying power after taxation. purchase, insurance, maintenance costs, fuel costs. the total cost is at least the double for europeans vs. american's. i.e. lets consider ourselves lucky and privileged instead of complaining.
buying car in japan is not expensive but majority of people who own car only drive during holiday. i'm not saying they don't have traffic jam and accident, they do. however i can guarantee the casualties due to car accident is far less than in north america. however, if american public transportation is efficient enough to move, say, 1 3 of population ditching their cars, can you imagine how much gas tax the government will receive less?
however, i was forced to sell it because i had just started two new jobs, didn't have the time to fix it rather than the lack of money, and i had to be able to move to and from places. you could say i purchased a newer car under necessity. i was always reluctant in getting into a newer vehicle because of what this guy just said and what i had seen and heard from my friend's newer cars. the technology and cost of newer vehicles is insane!
right on both counts. my suzuki grand vitara is 15 years old & is perfect, does everything well including 4x4 off-road which i do a lot. there is no software or fancy technology, no cameras, proximity alarms, cruise control, start stop, touchscreen, lane assist or any of that consumer duping bullshit. it is safe, comfortable, rugged, reliable and cheap to maintain. i'm dreading the idea of having to give it up for a modern piece of shit.
that’s why leasing is so popular. payment is lower than buying, and you’re always in warranty. the tech problem is mostly the consumers fault. if mfgs don’t constantly update, then they don’t sell cars. go all the way back to ford and the model t. they went from first to last because henry ford refused to let go of the model t, then they were forced to come out with the model a after losing a huge chunk of market share to gm and chrysler
i agree it's the 3rd world war been going on for a while. why do you need all that junk yeap,it will all become junk. soon. sometimes after the first breakdown,or the first fenderbender just to go get some groceries, is beyond me get a life people of your own do not think by herd mentality. buy used,fixable cars. do not auto-enslave yourself to exceed the need cars give them a lesson i let the nazis eat all them new soon old bms,mercs etc
my problem, which you addressed, is that i want a brand new car with all the luxuries of maybe a 77 chrysler imperial, but i can't find any. all the new luxury cars are basically rolling computers. i can't change the radio station, or the hvac without having to look at the on screen controls. in my crown vic, i can just reach for whatever control i want without having to look. i can keep scanning the road. whatever happened to ergonomics?
the problem is not the the manufacturers making these crazy expensive tech cars. the real problem is us the consumers. everyone wants the latest and greatest. no one is humble. everyone is materialistic as fuck. we are literally ruining the planet with the amount of waste we produce and all so we can show off our iphones and our new shiny cars. society is fucked and there is no going back. we will destroy ourselves. only a matter of time.
why do you get hate comments for sharing basic shit that people overlook this makes a great point, just got new car and that infotainment is a joke i had to take an extended warranty on it as well. now im just thinking,wow my nav needs an update and no they dont cover these things. the heat is tied into it. ive been renewing my cars about every two years just to avoid buying new 20inch all seasons let alone the 2k quote i got for winters.
at any rate you'd have to take your hands off the wheel to operate a tape player 20 years ago just as much as you do with a screen. even then, you have a keypad on your steering wheel so that you no longer have to do that. if you had any experience of the work that goes into these you'd know that the cost increase from 10 years ago comes from a tenfold increase in environmental, safety, reliability and quality requirements. and rightly so.
screw that, how about the $150 an hour labor mechanics charge, rounding up to nearest half hour even if job took 10 min. let’s not mention the markup that’s put on parts they acquire at wholesale. i’ve had plenty cars full of “technology” which never failed to work. yeah nav can be glitchy once in a blue moon, but car still drives, and everything works just fine after restart. mechanical items are much more prone to fail than digital once.
you are the man i am a huge volvo cars fan, owned several and plan on continue buying them, but man oh man, i had a bad moment when i saw that focking screen when they launched the new xc90, i knew it spot on that that piece of tesla crap will be the worst problem that car will face, and all the 90s series and later the 60s series when they will be launched. at least they could have let some of the nobs on so can have a backup or something
you get a ticket for driving while using your phone, and now they say even drinking coffee or soda or eating wile driving is distracted driving, and you can be fined for it. but they still allow car companies to put touch screens in cars. you can't reach over and turn a knob to turn on the heat or the radio like you used to, you have to take your eyes off the road and look at a screen to do those things. how is that not distracted driving?
your cost figures are absurd, using badly driven and maintained examples. aside from the fact than inflation over that 10 year period was more than 27%, more than half are based upon replacing parts that do not normally fail unless a vehicle is in a collision or not properly maintained. comparing a led headlamp assembly that is maintenance-free for the average expectaed vehicle life expectancy to a halogen ones that need lamp replacements?
dude, you are comparing a car that was built 10 years ago, to a 2016 car which u cant because a newer car will always have higher expense. it depends how and what car brand you drive. electronics in a car have been installed since the 1990's and i dont ever remember anybody complaining. a car depends on its maintence, not on if its electric or not. look at mercedes, runs bunch of electronics but the car can last well over 500 thousand miles
gone are the days of sleek designs with subtle details. now they are all over the top aggressive looking with styling 'add on's it seems all over the place. your section on technology is totally correct. most of it we don't need, car makers simply use clever marketing to hook people in to buying it all. as for replacement parts. don't get me started. todays prices are simply ludicrous, offensive and it is how car makers make the real money!
hmmm. i just got a letter from my car dealer that my software needs to be updated which doesn't support your statement. perhaps since i'm in my 40s i should not be participating in this discussion since these problems are relegated to those in their 20s and 30s. software updates eventually will be automatic. i essentially agree with you and give you a thumbs up, however technology is imperfect and costs money for everyone regardless of age.
i have to disagree with some of the reasons with this being the biggest problem of modern cars. you really don't need to take your hands off the wheel. your wheel has a lot of the buttons to do what is needed while driving. i would guess while there is an option to change your climate settings in the touch screen, there's probably another way to do it right under it. this isn't the case for every car and that's when it's a definite problem.
my 1988 corolla liftback has 13 steel wheels with mudcaps, and i asked around about their fuel economy. steel wheels are said to be more fuel efficient than alloy wheels on the highway due to the higher momentum. city driving might be a little cheaper, but since i bought the thing for 1300 and bought repairs for the machinery and chassis, the alloy wheels are simply waste of money. so is paint job. it gets at max 43 mpg at 50 mph. show less
one thing you left out cars are also becoming more interconnected. and if you cannot update say the infotainment system that's a big old security hole. but then look at chrysler's jeep division and i'd be willing to be nearly ever fca product has a secret telephone number. pretty easy to get that number and you can do things like screw with the hvac, brakes, even shut the car down while it's moving. that's why i'll never buy an fca product.
i think buy honda or toyota new, drive it long and service it well is the cheapest way of owning a vehicle. i personally bought a new accord back in 2002, switched to full synthetic early on and serviced it well all the years myself. changed the timing belt and water pump after watched a ton of youtube videos. now, it still runs more or less like new. plan to keep it as long as it runs and will teach kids how to drive with it in a few years.
tesla addresses most of these problems. they already have the top safety ratings and features, and soon-to-be fully autonomous driving which will dramatically reduce accidents. the low fuel costs and simpler motor make cost of ownership way lower. and their regular updates are one of the best qualities of the brand- people always say it's like getting a new car. this is why tesla is going to blow the old auto makers out over the next decade.
i didnt notice the screen in my mazda 3 is a touchpad because it works only standing still^^ saw in on yb, so not all brands are to deep in this. but hey, you are damn right. less is more and big screens in cars arent a improvement. many systems need a software, developing a new working software for komplex interfaces is kinda expensive or buggy^^ a car needs to perform, if i want entertaiment i get a android or apple. there are the car apps?
i'm impressed that people can't seem to keep up with rudimentary technological evolutions and resolve to using stuff that was up to date 30 years ago. i mean, if you enjoy driving a rust bucket with 0 security systems in a world where every modern car outperforms yours then go on. keep in mind though, the only reason you are able to drive some blast from the past is because somebody bought this thing, and it was probably pretty new back then.
they are putting this crap into work vehicles too. i drive a van for a courier company and only useful tech on the screen is the back up camera and that's it. to add, the a pillars are so large on new vans that they obscure the view of pedestrians when you turn. there are literally blind spots in front of you. a-pillar should stay thin yet strong, that means better materials. but they give you this cheap oversize crap that obscures your view.
while there are plenty of issues with cars, one of the biggest problems in the us, is that our country is completely car dependent. in other countries, people have choices whether to walk, bike, ride public transit or drive. that's not the case here. our communities are extremely sprawled making any option other than a personal vehicle nearly impossible. i think we need to stop subsidizing sprawl and bring competition to the personal vehicle.
all new cars and trucks are built using cheap plastic parts built to fail. even the wheels are built to be destroyed on impact. since the gullible public are still willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for junk, manufacturers make no effort to make them more durable. ford even puts plastic oil pans on $60,000 dollar trucks!. trucks advertised and designed to go off road!. so one trip off road might be the last your truck will ever take!.
i know a guy in singapore who does the injection moulding for suppliers of parts for bmw and other major car manufacturers. he swears that we are just getting ripped off on parts. he says that an average gauge cluster with all the wiring and electronics costs less than $100 to produce but is sold as a replacement part to the consumer for over $1000. ask any car dealership and they'll tell you the real money is in after sales service and parts.
soon or later. self driving cars are going to take over the world and at that time, you no longer have to own a vehicle because you can always use an app on your phone to summon the nearest available car to you and it will take you to your destination and you will be automatically charged for a fee when using this service. its going to be super convenient that people will never think about owning cars again. i see it coming, believe it or not.
the price of cars hasn't changed much a golf gti is about the same vs 1992 but i totally agree that the price of parts is crazy expensive and it's become harder to be a home mechanic. manufacturers seem to be pushing more people to lease in the uk because. people's disposible income is being spent on houses 7 times average salary, other monthly items cable, amazon prime, spotify, gym membership, credit cards and wages haven't grown in 8 years.
driverless cars. the amount of money it'll cost to maintain those shitbags, the money spent on map updates, the software upgrades, the risk you take, the fact that you will still have to have a drivers license and be positioned behind the steering wheel ready to take over in case of malfunction, who will die in case the computers are left to that decision, etc, these are too difficult factors to allow for such technology to ever fully take off.
i agree but at the same time these companies are fitting all these features in and cutting costs to meet the middle class buyer. so it's not exactly a win-win situation. we need to go back to styling vehicles with basic amenities whilst being at the forefront of reliability and not heavily promoting technological features that you don't need to replace the car after 4-5 years. these new cars just don't have the peace of mind that old cars have.
i'm an automobile engineer. i don't agree on the cost part as modern manufacturing techniques have made it incredibly cheap to make and assemble parts so it's as cheap as it can get. however, i feel absolutely the same as far as touchscreen infotainment systems are concerned. it's such a shame that most buyers are so oblivious to this fact. tactile buttons are safer, give better feedback, lasts for a lifetime and offer consistent functionality.
overall i agree but there are a few things i'd add. first off, cars are better than ever. a well cared for car should last 20 years. yes they are expensive but you can buy a 10 year old used car that still has lots of life left in it. i'm also dubious about the amount of technology in cars. if collision avoidance, anti-lock brakes, traction control and blind spot monitoring make us safer why don't they pay for themselves in insurance discounts?
your points are so absolutely true and on point for serious consideration. buying new cars has never been a great idea beyond having a factory warranty, yet, one will pay for that warranty, dearly and indirectly with depreciation of that appliance that gets you to work or the grocery store. i can do the same in a 90's pos and i can probably fix anything on that car myself. what did i do with the other $40000 i didn't have to spend on a new car?
i didn't get my first new car until i was 29, i had used beaters until i was 24 then i bought a decent used car for 4k and drove that until i was 29. previous generations also waited until they could afford to have kids, they either used birth control or practiced abstinence. you want a 40k car than here's what you do. study hard and go to college, work 2 jobs i graduated from florida state with zero debt and get good grades choose a real major!
i drive a thirteen year old saturn and i love it. it was cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, and the radio cd player is easy to use. the heating and air conditioning are very intuitive. whenever i rent a car on my travels i hate it when there is a touch screen there controlling the radio and environment controls. those cars are actually dangerous to drive because it takes so much attention to manipulate the controls. less is more. simple is better.
i ended up buying a 2018 honda fit ex-l to replace our 2008 honda element. clearly its smaller than an element but it makes great use of the space it has and averages 35mpg. it has a touchscreen and i use android auto with it. being able to speak to google and have it perform commands without touching the screen was the goal. it's not perfect yet but its better than most other cars. it also has lane sensing and adaptive cruise control. for $21k!
the analysis here is almost right. the single factor driving the cost, the technology and all the rest, is the government. by cranking up fuel efficiency and crash safety standards every couple of years they are forcing manufacturers to build crazy expensive and complicated cars. the random add-on technologies are to make the high price seem more reasonable. they don't sell inexpensive cars not because they don't want to, but because they can't.
the problem with cars isn't all the bullshit technology no one even needs because a lot of that stuff can be avoided by not choosing it as an option. the problem is manufacturers are using way too much goddamn plastic to meet environmental regulations. forget about some touchscreen going bad, if a car's components that are essential for driving begin to fail because plastic did not stand the test of time, that's when you'll really feel the burn.
a basic inexpensive car an impossible dream apparently. no money in it for the manufacturers. and all the little piggies want all the gadgets to boast about to their chums, and worry about the payments, insurance and service bills later. not that endless new government regulations help much. maybe restoring and running something like an ancient land rover might be one option. with aluminum bodies and bulletproof old engines they can last forever.
my vw golf mk 3 have outlived the mk 4. i went back to owning old cars that i fix my self. all mye new cars was not giving med a easyer life. the only new car bougt that was good is a toyota yaris that i still have. its just goes and goes, fun to drive an keept up with my friends m3 on a twitsty road. learned that the dealerships to many brands is no good. tesla beats the most cars to day. i just by a motorbike if i want to go fast, or a tesla 😎
i've got to agree with you mate. for me a car is a device meant to get people and their luggage from one point to another. that's it, i want to turn the key and drive. if i'm on my own i rarely even turn on the radio. i wouldn't even consider a new car. luckily i've got the skills needed to pick up a 5-10 year old car and keep it going. for me 5-10 years old is the sweet spot. morden enough to be reliable but old enough that the rot hasn't set in.
my experience is electrical components will begin to fail after 5 to 7 yrs. if they last that long especially with american cars. example, electric windows.beware of cvt transmissions,and engines pumping out a lot of horsepower from small displacement. those usually require a turbo and when they need replacement. watch out. kiss rule. keep it simple stupid. life is easier that way. especially after all that new technology has worn off on your car.
this comment is a little late. but here it is anyway. your example of a sampling of cost of parts going up 27% in 10 years. well, that works out to be about 2.5% a year compounded over 10 years. that's very much in keeping with inflation figures in the us over that period. so, yes, things have gotten expensive in the car world. but it's really in keeping with how everything else has gotten more expensive over that same period of time. just sayin'.
you are the boss. i am in my 40s. what i hate about new cars, other than them being general pieces of shit, is that they are not maintainable by the owner. my most recent auto is a 2003 volvo. all others are from the 70s and 80s. i am a man of means, so it ain´t the money that is holding me back. warren buffet is right. you should never spend more than 10 percent of your annual income on a automobile. that doesn´t mean spend 10 percent every year!
as a possible solution upgradable components on cars with modular form factors, just like plain desktop pc. let the user decide the components, and built up their config. if it breaks, just replace it with any aftermarket that's compatible. the touchscreen, radio, ac, gauges, engine, transmission, ecu, breaks, differentials, suspentions. but let the chassis be just one. you should even be able to interchange body panels, just as a smartphone cover.
i would say 1. 100% agree with you 2. freaky gizmos and so called assistance make car only fashionable and more addicting to them, like all this electro smart tv crap, you really do not need 3. cost to profit ratio-they say modern cos' have screens and touchpads., yep. for sure. the same in other models or lines. do not tell us useless and complicated yet fancy means premium its cheap for producer, costs a lot for consumer when it breakes somedays.
just pick a model between 2000 and 2010 which still does not have all those gadgets and invest in that car. in a long run it will be cheaper, especially if you are a diy person. my pick is bmws last petrol v8 without turbo ever, the n62, in x5 e53 chassis mechanically advanced but not so many sensors and cameras, mine is a bit more expensive to maintain but there are lots of nice cars with smaller engines from that period and with older technology.
it's a pity this had to start with cost that's more to do with the relative prosperity of now and the good old days not really a car issue. the technology discussion was more interesting it's unnerving how what starts out as an option becomes standard sometimes that's great, sometimes not. our stuff these days is cheaper and more reliable than ever, but often less long lasting and usually less repairable. and we rely on it all, ever more completely.
most of the tech in cars today has saved countless lives and brought the rate deaths by car accidents to an all time low. sure there are some unnecessary things in cars nowadays but instead of hating on modern tech all together in cars you should be advocating for better tech that's more durable and easy to fix. you highlighted some great problems but your angle of approach was just terrible and makes you sound like a old fashioned hippie or somthin
shood chat about the fact that 8 out of 10 mericans are workin paycheck to paycheck how the middle class is being scoopt out like french vanilla on a hot day how automation is killin off the unskilled labour market n the fact that more retail stores are closin down this year 2017 than any other year pretty much ever-- the death of the petro dollar n then tie all that in on fixin ur overpriced under utilized car that just sits around 95 % of the time
speaking as a professional driver, i despise new cars. they have become over complicated and are allowing people to make a menace of themselves because they are constantly distracted instead of paying attention to actually driving the vehicle. i see this constantly and we already know that the volume of traffic accidents has demonstrably risen. because of distracted drivers i don't even like to ride my motorcycle anymore. there are too many of them.
absolutely spot on, couldn't agree more. that's the reason why bugatti have gone old school on the latest chiron with knobs and levers, no touch screen. they didn't want it to look dated and obsolete in 10 yrs time but classic looking and timeless. my 2007 bmw has no onboard computer except for the super basic stuff like average mileage, autonomy and a couple other things. a very clean dashboard with classic gauges and no screen bar the very minimum.
and that a computer is controlling 90% of the car i feel my head spins from thinking of reliability. and i am a computer engineer. i see computers do weird stuff for no reason on an hourly base. i, myself, when i buy a car, i look for the lease amount of technology in it. also, you never hear car reviewers talk about reliability today it's the most painful fact for the person that buys a car instead of leasing and planning to keep it for a few years.
first point with cars being expensive cars have always been expensive. just owning one is a luxury. and you should always keep money around in case something goes bad. second point with technology. i agree that touch screen sucks for using media, climate control, etc. but you can't really nag about how additional features are a distraction when it is you as a driver who chooses to look down and search for where ever the best hot dog stand is located.
i honestly think the biggest problem with modern cars. is the current economy. people are not getting paid enough anymore nor do they have the job security anymore. car companies are seeing decreasing sales across europe and america, the only place it's growing is in the china india market where peoples living standards have improved. we are going backwards. put into slavery by mountains of debt that we'll be lucky if we ever pay off in our lifetime.
this is related to some of what you touched on, but there's been a huge lack of innovation in materials and construction, too. manufacturers are spending way too much researching how to run android on your dashboard, and not nearly enough on making cars lighter and more sturdy with more advanced materials science. what would the world be like if they had spent those billions on perfecting and scaling up carbon fiber manufacturing for mass production?
you can get great deals on pre owned cars that some other sucker has paid depreciation on and you can pick it up for 40-50% less than what it cost brand new and a a lot still come with the balance of a warranty or you get a certified pre owned from the dealer who provide a good warranty in some cases for a the same price range. 2017 toyota highlander new 30,630-46,260 2012 toyota highlander used 14,500-25,000 and 25 being the top of the line limited.
honestly i think the peak of the automotive industry other than the 1960s, was the early 2000s. people tend to forget what great cars were out around the 05-06 time frame. the gto, highly underrated car. the best acura ever produced other than the nsx the 3rd gen tl. the c6 corvette was introduced. the cadillac ctsv was growing. the chevrolet gmc silverado sierra was in it's greatest form, to me nothing beats the 99-06 gm truck. idk maybe it's just me
i can’t believe how different in a positive way you look at these things. almost no freaking channel talks about these issues, they rather praise these additions. i never looked at these features the way you have done which is mind boggling. last year, the software of my altima 12 went haywire n i had to update the software n it cost me over $800. i would have rather used that money for something else or could have fixed the broken bumper of my car 😂
i just bought a brand-new refrigerator who's price was adjusted to a small fraction of suggested retail. it works great but the temperature can't be adjusted since the electronic control panel is busted. i've been told that repair cost on that panel is $400. modern cars are like that fridge except that when electronics go wrong -- as they inevitably will -- the consequences of not fixing a car are far more dangerous than getting the fridge temp wrong.
then buy a small car, or on lease for 3 year. in uk where i used to live $200-250 for new civic or bmw 1 series, with all maintenance, u just has to fill up the gas. that's why average old car there is 6.5years & in usa 11.7 years. in uk i never bought new car i always bought 3-4 years old new £25k around £6-8k & drove them 4-5 years & dump them. in usa i had to bought brand new because second hand are not worth to buy & i will sell it after 3-4 years.
this video is the first one of yours that makes no sense to me. why would anyone think they need a $40,000 car in there 20s or 30s. sure if you can but that is so far from what anyone needs. you can easily buy a used family sedan for $10,000 that has 100,000 to 150,000 miles left in it. i was an electrical engineer by trade and waited until i was 43 for a new car. things were not that rosy in the past btw. cars needed plenty of repairs back in the day.
all this tech is just a way to shine all you suckers on that underneath all that tech is the same shit your grandpappy was driving, just more refined. a lot of the newer automotive tech is awesome but factory tech is geared towards fleecing you with bobbles. distractions and dangerous fantasies to make driving easier and more enjoyable. and costly, a shiny. comfortable, modern, futuristic space bubble is what people like. they want to crash and be safe.
has been the same 'problem' for many years now. people want to bag on the rich for the simple fact that they have plenty of money, yet without them at the start i wouldn't be able to be a second, fifth, tenth, whatever owner buying used vehicles for a price i can afford well after, and most importantly after the dust has settled and i can get a clearer view on what kinds of problems the vehicle i'm looking at might have. new car buyers get none of that.
the worst trends are the pop up tablet touch screens, automatic parking brakes and noisy parking sensors you cant turn off. try driving a modern car through an automatic car wash. the parking sensors go haywire and if you try to turn your car off to kill the noise, the parking brake comes on and can cause all kinds of havoc in the wash if it's a chain driven one. i nearly crashed a pugeot 5008 rental car in the car wash a few months a go because of this
we pay for the things we think we need because we're getting lazier and lazier. they earn because of our laziness. not generalizing all people that's why i'm so glad to see this video and the comments. and know that there are still people that fully understands what living and driving is that still love old cars. i love old cars myself. the only parts that i like on modern technology cars are the one's that keeps the car healthy and the safety features.
i just hate how all the new cars have so much random shit that clutter the car. my 2010 jeep is kinda present day but the dashboard and center panel is basic and tells you only what you need. all thease new cars have like 40 buttons just for the a c and like seat warmers steering wheel warmers, pedel moving, a light to show you the passenger air bag is off wtf and not to mention the big ass radio that is more dangerous to operate than going on your phone
i research the best automobile or truck, which is the most reliable and long-lasting, that i can find. then i buy one with say 36,000 miles on it for 2 3 of the original cost or less, and use it for 300,000 miles. this works very well with quality automobiles that can be used a long time. it works well with almost everything you bye. and i actually have a pretty damn good income, i could buy a brand new automobile if i wanted to. but why waste the money?
it used to be about performance, engine, transmission, convenience, comfort, mpg, safety and the like. now it's about connectivity, bluetooth, touchscreen whizbangs, how many usb ports, bose, blind spots monitors, lane change monitors, backup cameras, no key start stop and that one is particularly stupid, when all this crap starts to age--and break and yes, dear, everything breaks eventually the cost to fix all the whizbangs starts to approach a new car!
stop whining., you have a choice not to buy a car. every car owner knows that only thing tou win by owning a car is time and that is not always. secondly, if you absolutelty need to buy a car, buy something older. and if you cant afford to get your car fixed then learn how to do it yourself. don't be lazy ass consumer who whines about prices an reliability and yet you buy the damn thing. some time later you post a video how bad this is. what's the point?
thank you for making this video. it's a harsh, but honest dose of reality that many people, especially the younger or seriously vain, don't even think about. most of us don't have bottomless pockets. for those who do, my comment is not for you. the more features you have on your car, the more there is to go wrong and the more money you will spend fixing it. it's as simple as that. what happened to a vehicle being an affordable mode of personal transport?
buy a 5 years old well-maintained toyota or a honda sedan no one needs an suv, it will last at least 20 years with proper maintenance. i have a 12 years old toyota avalon fully loaded with all the options available at its time and it didn't gave me any issues. i have owned just two japanese cars since i started driving in 1998 with zero major issues. you just need to make the right decisions. stay away from american and european cars and you will be good.
have to hand it to tesla they're the only car manufacturer that is committed to keeping their car's software up to date. i see features added to my model 3 on a regular basis. problems are fixed with similar over the air updates. this applies to their older cars too, not just the new ones. even their first cars get features and fixes pushed to them. i'm sure at some point they'll cut off the vehicle's that have hardware that can't accept the new features.
and because of these reasons, and more, im ecstatic that i still have my hand-me-down 55 dodge powerwagon. anything goes wrong, undo a couple of bolts and replace the part. someone brake checks you, and the ass end of their car or escalade becomes a high vitamin meal for the truck. they get towed and i drive away with a minor scratch on the bumper. cheaper parts and no need to pay out the hind-end for a mechanic. and no fancy electronics to screw you over.
back in 1982 i made $3.50 an hour and bought a 4yr old mustang for $5k. it was not that hard to make payments. fast forward to today, he used a $15k car as an example. a 4yr old base model mustang is $15k today. oregon min wage is ~$11 heading toward $15hr. over 3x the income and car price is around 3x actually less for my mustang example, so i could argue car cost is not worse. it actually takes less of your total income than when i was a college student.
i have a friend who had an old early 2000's toyota corolla. the ones with barely no options and no electronics. super simple. she had the car for as long as i've known her. maybe 9 years. i rarely take rides with her, but one day we drove 2 hours. i said let's crack open the sunroof. she says, it's too sunny outside. i said just tilt if up for more air she's like how i pushed the button forward and it tilted up. she said wow, i never knew it could do that!
i’m all for moving motors to electric and hybrid whatever which it seems i’m in a bit of a minority but my biggest issue with cars nowadays are these damn infotainment systems and how everything is made out of plastic or some cheap synthetic material. cars nowadays are not built for longevity, and they’re only chasing trends and that just doesn’t feel genuine. electric motors and that is fine, but the plastics and touch-screen infotainment is all bullshit.
my wife drives 1993 volvo 240, and i drive 1992 volvo 940. both were gotten used for peanuts, many years ago. they have no book value, they are exempt to emissions testing due to their age, they cost noting to insure, they are extremely safe and sturdy, they are also economical with regards to fuel 4 cyl, and repairs which are few and far between. moreover, they look cool on the road. point being, we all have choice. one does not have to buy $ 50k new car.
no one said you had to buy a modern vehicle there are plenty of other cars out there, from older time periods if you should prefer ready to be purchased. as far as technology systems go, they are designed to help keep you safer, so stop being a baby and crying about it. and if being protected really bothers you that much, in most cars you are capable of disabling those features. again, who said you had to buy a 40 grand car with all that stuff in it anyway
touch screens are stupid, are hazardous, and should be illegsl in cars. touch screens require one to scroll and search through apps, lists, and menues for x, y, and z controlling audio functions, volume, radio stations, heater & ac, etc thus causing users to look away from the road for several seconds. on the other hand, hard switches, which we learn to use by touch allow users to stay focused on the road. why are touch screens not banned from automobiles?
your argument about technology is invalid to me. most drivers aren't using yelp while driving, their passengers might, if they need to, they pull over. it's true that some might but those same drivers that would use their car touch screens to yelp while driving would be doing the same thing with their cell phone. in general, if the driver needs to do something such as find a restaurant, most cars come with voice commands these days, you can just use those.
another thing you overlook, i think, is this is all meant to create revenue streams for them. you will be coerced to paying for monthly services for things. they already trained people with onstar which i knew was ominous. i resent deeply simply mechanical things they have done that are also designed for creating a revenue stream. those stupid hydraulic lifters fail at a very high rate. in older cars with springs they are still working for 40 years or more.
assume an annual 4% inflation, cars worth $15k 25 years ago will cost $40k today. and 25 years ago you get a piece of shit made out of metal, today you get a solid engine & transmission & platform, leather, so many nice amenities like qps, sound system, cellphone integration, led lighting, etc. actually for all the evil that car makers cause pollution, co2, they also made billions of people's lives better over the years while not costing significantly more.
i have to agree with you on mainly the first part but the 2nd too. 1 this is both a good and bad thing tech to help vehicle emissions. this is a great thing but in its self cost the owner money by having to pay to keep dpf and other additives topped up. i am lucky. i drive a 2002 uk speck ford focus 1.8 tdci so i have no dpf but i still have an egr valve. this is designed to recirculate the gases back through the engine to clean them even more. great right?
i was born in the early 80’s and even though my “modern car” has a backup camera in it, i can’t keep from still using my mirrors like i was taught. when i managed a u-haul i rented a pickup truck to a college student. i gave him the keys and 3 minutes later he came back in to hand me the keys and request i back it out for him because the truck had no backup camera and he didn’t know how to backup without it. he had never driven a car without a camera in it!
the car allowance rebate system the 3 billion dollar campaign to crush cars older than 2001. and that date keeps moving up. so eventually most people will have computer operated cars. even junk yards crush those cars. and parts are harder to find. they say it is over fuel efficiency but we all know its stimulus for dealerships and repair shops. hell they are even trying to wipe out local garages over it. or neighborhood repair guys. its the government baby!
yes, modern cars are a money pit when things start break down with tons of computers, sensors and all kinds of gadgets. but if you have a bit of time and mechanical inclination, used mid 1990's cars are good alternative.for anyone who doesn't want to spend more than few thousand dollars on a car. and these cars are also much easier cheaper to repair for people who are willing to do diy repair. so the short story is don't buy new cars with huge depreciation!
the issues isn't that modern cars are getting expensive to maintain. it's people don't know how to maintain or even fix basic items on a car. most will just let dealers or mechanics do everything not knowing that they can charge a high premium for something as simple as replacing your side mirror. people also don't know anything about part sourcing. used parts from a junk yard or aftermarket parts will work fine just like the oem part, why pay almost double?
i have had some trucks in use for business affairs the elder one became 39 an the younger one 28 yrs old before they were sold. the spareparts were available to the last day mercedes even very special things i needed and the most repair-jobs could be done by myself. not one single car built today will be alive 2040 or later. the electronics won't be available after 5 7 yrs after production and without this micromegashit the vehicle is doomed to the scrapyard.
a friend not long ago had the lcd screen crack in his nearly new toyota. dealer came back and said it was his problem must have been too hard on it, and first quoted $3500 to replace it as the entire unit had to be replaced, then later got the price down to $2000, and then finally the dealer agreed to replace it on their dime as toyota said the would not cover it. makes me wonder about what happens when today's cars are 10 years old and in the used car market?
best cars are from the late 90s and early 2000s. reliable but with power, less electriconics, less sensors, comfort, abs, airbags. new cars are choked by emission standards, needing to squeeze more and more power with smaller engines and big turbos, lighter and lighter transmissions and gear trains that just don't last. sensors that are vital to the car which can and often break and cost a lot. electronic faults that take hours to diagnose but 5 minutes to fix
do not use your car for short trips. use a bicycle with gears to climb up the hills, 40 % of all trips in the usa is under 2 miles. you can cycle that. my advise buy a dutch city bicycle. you can ride with your normal clothes on. the panniers can hold your groceries. you get excersize. also if you do not use your car regularly, you can share it with other people through an app. for a fee of course. or you can rent a car, if you need a car once every two weeks.
i will keep my 95 dodge dually until the wheels fall off, and then i will walk. being a former dealership mechanic, i see how modern vehicles are built, and i will not own one. full authority engine management is a costly way to go, it used to be found only on aircraft, but now is found on average cars. good luck finding a mechanic that understands the system, good luck affording the needed repairs. i understand the systems, and this is why i wouldn't own one.
bs -too many useless little parts that only add to maintenance costs -overall purchase cost you can blame the economy for that tho -all looks and numbers and no performance hood bulges on cars with under 200hp and cars that actually have more than 200hp that feel slower than a miata, yes i'm looking at you golf gti -fuck automatics -fuck cvt -fuck paddle shifters -and a special fuck you to the new nsx, senna is probably still crying on his grave because of that
i drive a 90ies car and no shame on it. i think they are also the coolest looking ones and with no bs. i probably could afford buying a modern car without crashing my bank account but the thing is, cars are made to drive you from one place to another and not to be all this bs they want to put down your throat like massaging seats, cameras everywhere that let you record shitt and put in in social media. just useless stuff in the end of the day and very gimmicky.
i get the feeling that software on all these modern touch control screens is an easy target for hackers and allows them access to things even more vital like the ecu and what have you i'm not a car expert, especially when you consider that from what i do understand there is little to no antivirus kind of protection and a complete lack of innovation in the sector in general not to mention they simply never want to update the software because costs, costs, costs!
we want air-conditioning, multimedia system, safety features, automatic transmission, hill-hold assist. it has to cost. not mentioning, that volvo 90 or mercedes 124 were and today are, if well preserved extremely cheap in service and almost any do-it-yorself enthusiast could fix it in his own garage with simple tools if it rarely broke, would you buy a new car like dacia duster in basic, cheapest version of equipment on board if it is possible to buy it in us?
i disagree. with your example with the restaurant, you said its dangerous. false, its only dangerous if you make it. if someone looks for a restaurant when parked, then drive when they found it, it is then not dangerous. the only time it is dangerous is when the driver makes it. an analogy could be with guns. a gun isnt dangerous unless the person handling makes it that way. the problem is the people who use the technology in bad ways, not the technology itself.
the no one said you had to buy. is a silly counter point to this video. this video was addressing the fact that modern cars are getting more expensive to repair and buy. in the future it may be cheaper to buy the now modern cars, but maintenance will still be equally expensive. also, when it does come down to buying said modern cars as a affordable used vehicle, the older reliable cars wont be around, or will be pristine collectors items which will be a fortune.
the solution is simple. work with apple and or google on a standalone auto os that they handle updates for. design the os for a few different screen sizes and call it a day. most infotainment systems suck bc most automakers dont specialize in that area. let the pros deal with it. as far as other tech like safety systems, the only thing i really appreciate is blindspot monitoring. its a nice system that alerts you but doesnt interfere with the driving experience.
being in the auto collision industry i can say new cars are 100% overpriced junk. don’t need a car with a $2000 head light. an $800 mirror. back up sensors, radar sensors, tire pressure sensors, rain sensor. i could go on and on. cars total out now before there is any real damage now because of all the overpriced bs crash avoidance system crap. real wast. the safest car on the road has a spike sticking out of the steering wheel. you drive that car very carefully.
buy a car that has a reputation for reliability buy a car you can afford to buy and also maintain. stay away from glitzy tecky expensive options that are very expensive to repair. there's a reason toyota is the worlds leading manufacturer of cars they aren't the best looking or the fastest or the best handling they are the most reliable available. there are other car makers with cars that are almost as reliable so inform yourself or pay pay pay for your mistakes.
get a 90s gen toyota it will last forever its fuel efficient its cheap it will never break if well maintain and even if it breaks spare parts are cheap as hell and there not alot of things to break modern cars are great but if i was a fresh graduate with a entry level income im gonna buy a pre owned late 90s civic cheap to buy cheap to insure cheap to fix cheap to maintain cheap to run and does everything you need it to do as a car new cars are more of a luxuries
i have a backup sensor in my 2014 ford edge. i actually really like it because i suck at parralell parking. other than that all features new features are garbage. there was a period of time when the sensor broke. i didnt bother fixing it. it was a nice luxury to have but im cool without. ironically, i got rear ended and when i got my bodywork done from the insurance claim, i just said the sensors stopped working as a reult of the accident. haha, free new sensors!
overly complicated everything, and you cant do nothing to it your self. they are not built to last, the touch screens sucks ass in winter time and a button is much more logical and convenient and faster. to much stupid electronic safety systems witch are hard to turn off. best bang for the bucks is a ford crown victoria or similar. the best value for money is to buy is a 5-10 year old mercedes c or e without air suspension and with a naturally aspirated v6 or v8.
purchase, running costs, reliability, comfort, convenience are at an all time low. the fact that you are a street beggar or have a low paid job doesn't give you the right to a life that those who work hard enjoy. you admit you ran into a car so clearly are a twat who should have that privilege revoked. truth is you're a stupid cunt who wants to remove technology in cars and yet uses the very same technology in your vain youtube posts. you can't have it both ways!
i have a 2006 porsche cayenne turbo with self leveling bi-xenon headlights. frail wire sheathing is brittle and cracked. replaced the connecting wires but internal wiring is going bad. everything works fine except i have no right front turn signal, and face buying a $600 one side headlight assembly to have a turn signal. it's great having a powerful fast vehicle but terrifying to think of all the overly complex and ridiculously expensive items that can will break.
create the problem, mandate that you pay for it, then mandate a solution & force you to pay for it at gunpoint.- government create a problem, sell you the problem, then create a solution & sell you the solution.- capitalists you generally have a choice to not buy the problem, making buying the solution unnecessary as well, from the capitalist unless the capitalist can convince bribe government to mandate that you buy it, like airbags, reverse cameras, & insurance .
i was bumbed out with my pos 03 focus that i have replaced every part myself & i have updated it with, all new suspension, much better brake's, all sensors, water pump, & all cooling components, a 6.2 4g wifi,cd, dvd, front & rear camera, amp & subwoofers & so much more, the list would go on & on but, at least i can fix it myself & have it back on the road within a reasonable time period even if something major happens. i agree with everything stated in this video!
it has a real key, that costs $3 to replace, not $300 with a chip in it. roll up windows, no power anything, except steering and brakes. only needs gas, oil, and tires. simple maintenance and guess what everyone, it gets me to work, dinners, dates, movies, work. it isnt a new $50k infinity, or even a $25k kia!. it also doesn't have all those power everything to break, for me to pay to fix down the road, if it lasts. bring back some basic cars with realistic prices!
its stupid excuse. if u can afford 70 000 cars u can afford 3-4k to service the car. modern techinologies have nothing to do with it. abs air bag sensors. having a map in the car is doesnt have anything to do with ur safety cause its only work when u in park or the car stop completely. its so costly for a service cause u dont service the car so often + bring to a trusty mechanic so they dont do dog shit jobs on ur cars. just do ur service regular and get an import!
we're returning to the status quo of the early 20th century, where only the very well off could afford to own a car. neither of my grandfathers owned a car or indeed had a drivers licence such was beyond the means of the average working man. trouble is, we've allowed public transportation to languish. here in western canada, there is no longer passenger train service in calgary and regina, and greyhound is halting all bus service west of northern ontario this fall.
i needed a daily driver that could haul 4x8's from time to time. after pricing trucks and vans with an average of 40k i settled on a 2016 grand caravan avp because of this very reason. the build may not be perfection, but with minimal electronics and a price of $18,500, i couldn't find a better option. in todays world $300 will buy you and android system with screen mirror and a backup camera that you can update and root if you feel like it. this bubble has to bust.
that's why old cars will outlive the modern vehicules, maybe even cause the automotive industry to realise that they must stop all that and go back to been basic as more and more of my generation generation y z would rather buy an old used car rather than a new one not only that but they try to appeal to us with all that tech. but we already got a smartphone for that so its pretty useless the worst for me is that. why should i buy a new car if my old one still work?
you are spot-on with all of this. this is why, when it comes to luxury cars, most that i know anyway people lease them for 1-3 years because that is about the amount of time it takes for a the technology to become obsolete, and b for something expensive to go wrong. i hate the modern car market because as you said it is creating basically disposable cars. and, there is no difference between fiddling with your phone and fiddling with an obnoxious infotainment system.
as a mid 20's car enthusiast, i'd honestly rather own an older vehicle. you get to learn how to fix a car, and it's knowledge that stays with you. it makes you appreciate the car, and it is honestly less than buying even a vehicle that is 5 years old. it's strange because the new vehicles have the younger consumers in mind, yet only the older generation can afford them that typically don't know how it works, and would rather have it simple anyways. it pleases no one.
i guess it all depends on what you do. i work hard and own a 2012 ford taurus with now 163k and have owned it since brand new. payment was only 350 on it for 4 years paid off now and has had zero issues besides doing normal matienence items such as oil changes, transmission fluid changes, one strut, and tires. i have not put any money into it that you wouldn't have with a older vehicle and this one gets better mpg, drives nicer, and doesn't ever go to the repair shop
i wish my acura's automatic climate control would blow me. seriously, it doesn't work worth a damn. i want three knobs fan speed, temp, and location. another issue is that mechanics don't know how and or don't have the time to fix these complex systems. my car's nav system died, and the dealer would only replace the entire system couple grand!, i figured out the problem, and ordered the faulty part straight from china. $40, an hour of my time, and it works just fine.
in response to the first problem, dont expect to be able to pay off your college tuition working in retail and then whine when youre struggling while simultaneously taking out loans that you cant afford to pay off and feel entitled to be pardoned from in a couple years. i hate to say this but people in my age bracket 20-25 are just too lazy to work for anything and want everything to come easy for them.i have yet to meet someone else my age working the same job i am.
wow. we are so far behind in india😂😂 for $40,000 we get cars that have no airbags or maximum 2, no touchscreen not even a single din music player, no heated or vented seats, no auto dimming irvm, etc etc 😂 for $36,669 we get the top spec model of the jeep compass that comes with no cruise control, no sunroof, smaller touchscreen. oh and no trailhawk version either, plus all variants limited to 2 airbags only. we get blanks on the steering wheel of the top model xd
i was waiting for a diatribe on auto safety systems. you're absolutely right. i see drivers drifting out of their lanes all the time while fiddling with these fucking touch screens. they're just as distracting and cell phones. hell they may be more distracting. at least with my cell phone i can hold it up in front of the windshield not recommended, these systems require averting your gaze from the road. nhtsa needs to weigh in here just like they did with cell phones.
i'll agree with much of the points from #2 because i always rather have 3 simple knobs and a couple of buttons to control most basic features, but give me a damn break with your first point. just from the list of your videos that come up while watching this, i see you reviewing an audi a5, a toyota land cruiser, a volvo v90, a bmw m3 and on and on and on. you complain about the price of cars, but where are your reviews of low-option simple family sedans or hatchbacks?
yeah, all this shit is great until it fails. i'll bet most people today can't find their way around without a gps. a road map can't fail unless it catches fire, or blows out the window, and it doesn't need a signal, but it does need a brain that knows how to read it. give me a 1964 chevy nova. it has a radio and heater. there's nothing under the hood or on the dashboard that i don't understand. just about nothing i can't diagnose and fix my self. simple, easy, period.
i agree. even my 2006 subaru has a radio cd player that is integral and will be a total waste of space if when the government pulls the plug on vhf radio as they propose. at least most of the rest of it is fairly 'square nut' engineering. however, my favourite car is a caterham 7 no infotainment system indeed nothing much that wasn't fitted to the car when it first appeared in 1957 the engine ecu is about the only worry and there are after-market alternatives if it dies
cars are expensive hahaha of course. but buying a brand new car is like getting a house build. it' not realistic until you have some serious stable income. until then, you are stuck buying second hand cars and renting housing. you are right about the tech. cars that were first to have sat nav systems were revolutionary at first. now they're out of dated and not practical anymore. things are not build to last anymore. they are build for profit and short term gratification
i want my 90s honda back. 4cy, manual transmission, am fm radio tape deck, none of the modern tech that costs a fortune, pretty much the only upgrade it had was the vtec engine and 4-wheel disc brakes. that's all i want on my car. i don't need the touch screen navigation, the slushbox automatic or leather interior. the stuff just costs too much to maintain. i know what you mean. unless your rich, hard to afford a decent family vehicle anymore w o going into massive debt.
the problem is not driving car but the transportation system. i grew up in hong kong where 80% of population rely on public transportation. it's cheap and efficient, and of course, safe. if some people challenge me but hong kong is a tiny city, we are talking about north america well, look at japan. 10 millions live in tokyo and many live in country side and they don't have to have a car because of the national public transport system is internationally-famous efficient!
uh-oh, propaganda alert. capitalism gives you choice. if you are stupid, you give your money to smart people who will then get rich. capitalism rewards smart spending and punishes stupidity and bad investments. don't blame capitalism. blame stupid. also fuck socialism. you wouldn't even have the choice to own a car in a fully socialist state ussr and north korea come time mind, in venezuela, the latest victim of socialism, people are killing each other over toilet paper.
and that's why i despise new cars and new car technology more and more. especially with the proliferation of automatic transmissions and driver aids for sheeple who couldn't drive their way out of a fucking wet paper bag. that's exactly why i'm getting an e39 bmw 540i sport. yes, it's got computers and shit, but they're also easy to work on, a blast to drive and parts good quality are actually pretty inexpensive if you know where to shop. screw new cars. save the manuals!
ditto, ditto, and more ditto. new cars today are mandated by the u.s. government and political officials mandating safety and auto manufactures are passing the expense to consumers. the more bells and whistles takes batteries to operate. a simple electrical issue really hacks up every other modern electrical safety item today. ditto on distinctive driving for operating such simple things and the volume on the radio, cruise control or even adjusting the air in the vehicle.
i think my baja is too damn big and it's actually smaller than my mother's civic if it wasn't for the bed. it has an aftermarket stereo and an aux jack, it does all the same shit that any infotainment set up will actually do, yes even display any gauge i want thanks to the magic of bluetooth obdii readers. unlike the modern infotainment setups single and double din stereos are always going to be upgradable because it's built to a standard and not some proprietary nonsense
first of all, buying a new car is a very bad financial idea. you can buy a second hand car for one quarter the price and even with repairs and addons you still won't get anywhere more than a third the price of a new car. the only things that matter to me are how good the ac is, how well it rides, how much can i put in it and how good are the headlights a set of powerful halogens can do the job costing nothing and if the model is popular which means spares are easy to get .
technology is getting better and better everyday. cars are getting more feature packed with standard equipment like volvo's city safety. this somewhat forces other manufacturers to make this equipment standard as well, thus producing it more and streamlining the process. which will make things cheaper. rn this is kind of the awkward age for technology, where it voice still cracks but it's growing more and more. but let's be real 90% of the time you won't have any problems.
thanks for the video. there is also the staggering cost of depreciation of new vehicles. i have a 19 year old opel astra g and i can perform most maintenance tasks on this car myself. because the car is older, parts from auto wreckers are readily available and are cheap. i am amazed that so many people fail to think outside the square and just buy a new car without realizing how much it is actually going to cost them in terms of loan interest, depreciation and maintenance.
20 year olds are not targeted to buy $40k cars. car makers know this. that’s why they offer, and advertise $15-20k cars because that’s what they can afford. and most tech doesn’t need to be repaired. and people without the means know fully well what they would be willing to pay to fix. and the government has enforced most safety systems, and people desire them more so they put more and more into the cars. this is a weird list of things framed mostly incorrectly. dumb video.
new cars are designed so you can't work on them. you're supposed to get a new one every 3- 5 years. it's 2032 and you get in your 2018 proton-evc and when you try to start it the 'enfotainment center' says your software is out of date. upgrades are not available. contact mfgr. for new car. have a nice day. sucker!, lol young people don'y have cars because they can't afford a new one every 3 years and they don't know how to work on old ones. is this a lug wrench?. maybe. lol
tesla. i heard good things when they are new but very very bad things when only 3-5 years old. perhpas this is the way the car malers will push. every 5 years a new car company cars for sure. yesterday i got a mail from gm europe with a interesting new sales strategy. they offer book by cadillac which i have to look a bit closer not cheap butvery entertaining i´m sure others will follow and when this comes down to normal daily cars the whole sales and ownership will change!
agree 100%. all vehicles have become fly by wire these days. the throttle. the brakes, the transmission. the center dashboard touchscreen is a joke unto its self but, there it is. and when it malfunctions, nothing is cheap to repair. i just look at tires alone these days, and how overly complicated they've become when it comes to sizes. a person needs $600 to $1000 just to get a new set of rubber on their car. and most people willingly pay it without thinking twice about it.
i sure don't. the more people i talk to who have what i consider to be very nice things are often in a massive amount of debt because they're living well beyond their means. if most people drove what they could actually pay off in 4yrs or less, i think it'd be shocking to see how many people have to drive economy cars and used cars when they've always bought nicer new cars. instead we have 20-somethings buying vehicles that require $600 mo payments for 6yrs. that's insanity!
my number problem with modern cars is many don't have a dipstick to check the engine oil or and the transmission oil wtf is that shit about, also those expensive parts your talking about will eventually be cheap, you cant compare a headlight from 10 years ago to a brand new one, even that led xenon headlight that cost $500-600 will eventually be dirt cheap, technology and car parts are always expeisive when new but after a few years you can get it on ebay for next to nothing
oh no, so so boring. back to bike's i'm thinking for my driving entertainment. and the classic in the garage. if i need a modern car i'm hoping i'll be able to get one for local use as part of a driving club, sort of pay by the hour and drop off where there's drop off point. hey, if you drive bikes, don't be foolish, they will kill you if you misbehave. owning a car is going to become a thing you do if you love driving and just want to enjoy that rare breed, a petrol vehicle!
one thing i learned to hate about modern cars fuck gps updates costing $100+. i thought it would be cool to have a car with integrated gps. now i know that it's a total rip off. you'll pay ~$1,000 to add that option to your car, then ~$100 every time they release an update. save your money and buy a $10 mount for your phone and use google maps which is free, or buy a garmin gps which has lifetime free updates. with garmin, it's a one time fee of about $89 for the unit itself.
this video is too true. i had about 5000 saved up and decided to buy a used 2004 corolla with 93k on it. its no different from the newer ones and its way cheaper to repair and maintain. literally the same car compared to new ones and i've had no issues with it at all. so i save a lot of money especially since i literally need it to drive an hour to college to get that nursing degree and work part time. so if you really need a car, get an old used corolla, that shit is a tank!
newer cars are great and older cars are great. like comparing a country girl to a city girl. both have pluses and minuses. bad analogy, city girls suck. but you get the idea. for around town i love to drive my 20 year old jeep or 60 year old truck. for long trips i get in my new luxury car with some of the craziest technology ever. it literally monitors my body motion and detects when it thinks i may need to take a break. oh and adaptive cruise control is like a gift from god.
i agree about the touch screens. i have owned a tesla for 34 months and i still hate the lack of individual switches, using the screen while moving is dangerous. the car is near 100% computer controlled but so are all modern cars. we really need some right to repair laws that would allow third parties access to diagnostics and the ability to support cars that the manufacturer no longer wants to know about. just one more example of short term greed leading to long term collapse.
buying a car is the problem. enjoy the comfort & tech through a lease & exchange for a newer model before any issues present themselves. modern day cars & the technologies within them will be obsolete within the next 15 20 years and so will this discussion. if you think people will still be driving cars within the next few decades, then you are clearly not in the loop. autonomous vehicles & shared use vehicles are here to stay. you won't be behind the wheel of your car for long.
engineered to fail for a steady profit from periodic sales. like everything else these days, the car is becoming less a product you can buy and own until you decide it's had its life and more a service that requires constant payment in the form of professional service they're so complicated that it's no longer possible to repair your own car no matter how much you know about mechanics and periodic replacement with newer supposedly better models that the company decides you need.
i totally agree with your take on owning a vehicle stuffed with endless electronic gadgets. driving a modern up-to-date car beats hauling along in a noisy and gas-guzzling beaten-up shitbox, but you must factor in handing over your stuffed wallet at the dealership every time you turn up with electronic problems once the warranty has expired. maybe the safest way is to buy cars with generous warranties and don t abuse them while they are covered.then trade it or hope for the best.
a real safety feature would be if the driver starts playing with a touch screen and a camera facing the driver sees they are not paying attention to the road, then the vehicle pulls to the side of the road and parks until the driver is ready to pay attention to driving. i would not be surprised to see in 6 years all cars having a built in breathalyzer so you have to have your fingerprints read, your face scanned and not be under the influence of anything before the car will start.
cars, what about electronics, what about ecology and shit, that lead-free solder just breaks from day 1 so after 2 year warranty it will break in full and no connection. everything is affected by that. old cars car run for years. i just changed my 2001 honda civic 87k to my friends civic 42k serviced always at honda. he gave me that as gift for free and it will run for years. next modern cars thing is led light, try them in poland in -30, how will they defrost if there is no heat?
hyundais and kias used to be simple, inexpensive cars that were fairly reliable and now theyre nearing luxury-car levels of features and design. its hard to get into a decently equipped volkswagen jetta for less than $26k now. the jetta was supposed to be an accessible, fun to drive, compact sedan. mazda seems to be one of the few companies that's improved their cars leaps and bounds over the last few years, while still appealing to the enthusiast and keeping the price reasonable.
if people wanted cars to be simple and reliable, then companies would sell it to you. if audi thought that they'd sell more models having a simple, clean ui infotainment system, they would do it. the thing is that people who are actually car enthusiasts like people who are watching this video aren't the people buying new cars. sure subaru, toyota, maybe even ford will have one model to market to you, but by and large, you're not buying their new cars, so they don't care about you.
it is for the cost. a software based touch screen control panel is much cheaper to build and mass produce than separate physical buttons. they are easier to build and are aesthetically more appealing to average consumers. and what sucks is the amount of brain energy a driver should put into interacting with these complex control panels for doing simple tasks. and when that takes their attention away from the road they become the most dangerous life-threatening bugs in modern cars.
it's not always possible to do so there is however a point you forgot to mention and that's fuel cost. the fact that modern cars like hybrid consume much less thus lesser fuel cost per year can not be ignored. lets not even mention the electric cars. so in a sense you have less cost with fuel which you are going to spend to repair the technology. i know you are not saving money but at least you are not losing neither depending on your problem thanks for the video. very interesting
just once until you need a new ride. i rented a new mazda iii in england recently. what a piecer everything is electronic. zero feedback from the trans, gas or the damned wheel. you are completely disconnected from the road surfaces. that is very dangerous for men like me from the old school that also use feel to drive safely. on the single carriageways with the added disorientation of the oncomings in the right lane i am from cali i felt like i was playing a video game. bad shit.
the ok google in my phone understands me, my wife and my kid. no problem. talk to a fusion 2017 sports. all you get are i am sorry but. the gimmicks are now 25% of the car cost an and after 3 weeks with them, you ignore it all. cause the damn green line on your rear camera just looks like a tennis court. before you buy any new car download their manual greatest service the net has read through the whizz-bang doo das. if after 3 days you understand what they are saying buy the car.
this is something i think about all the time. i drive a 93 honda accord 5 speed manual i dug out of a guys backyard for $500 and did most of the repairs to get it back on the road myself. it was already over 300,000 miles when i bought it but it doesn't drive like it. parts are cheap and the car is extremely simple and practical and is well maintained. i pray everyday no one totals my car because i cannot afford a new one and the high demands for older ones are making them scarce.
when i bought my brand new car i wanted a head unit with xm, gps, and phone integration with basic app support, i made sure ahead of time to find a car that has the infotainment portion separate. it seems that a lot of car manufactures are putting a second screen in separate form the music and gps etc. this allows one to later replace their head unit with a different one without impacting the core functions of the car. i plan to eventually replace it with an android car play unit.
i bought my car because of the practicality of it and i know what i'm getting in to when i bought it, first of all educate yourself, before i bought my car i look at every car out there what's right for me. don't buy a car that's too expensive for you to pay in the long run, there are warranty in the car so if anything breaks the dealership will fix it for free i have 8 years warranty on mine, i'm mechanically inclined i can fix minor stuff so if you can't fix minor stuff why drive?
i am dead serious. i live in ct with awful salty roads and i have never washed it. guess what, no signs of rust or paint problems. it has 3 knobs for climate control. it has the coldest blasting ac in any car i have driven. i have driven it for hours without getting annoyed of sitting down. it has cargo space for two downhill mtb's, plenty of gear tools, while i drive with a passenger. it does just fine in the snow with decent all season tires on it. i get 35 mpg without even trying!
it used to be buying a car and running it into the ground was the most economic way to go. but, nowadays, leasing is looking better and better. by the time the lease is done, the b2b warranty is pretty much over. now, if the car breaks, it's no longer in your hands. and you're onto a new car. a shame, really. i take pride in ownership and keeping the vehicle in great condition and working order. unfortunately, a body control module goes bad, it can cost $1400 or more. obnoxious, imo.
love it. i'm in my early 20s, totally agree with you. it's always surprising to me how many of my peers go out and spend tens of thousands on new shiny shit. i get the impression that you're have a tech background. i'm a software engineer, and the second point you made drives me nuts, because i see it too. and i think many younger folks get it, as is evidenced by the number of people leasing. ses make really good money, but why the fuck would i want to sign on for perpetual payments?
you're absolutely right these is the very reason why i don't by into the electric cars because unlike those who look at the hype, i see how these will became a problem. automotive companys will make them like phones by planned obsolescence. the quality of cars will go down the drain. in favor of a quick cash. at the same time you will no longer be in control of the car and the car will drive you. people in the future will became lazy as f@#$ and no longer be in control of there life.
your first point is so true. when i was growing up i even got a used car for this reason my parents bought it i see so many kids whose parents have money driving new cars, but that's an entirely different argument. good for them. here i am 30 and i'm still driving a 20 year old car. it's cheap to keep up and never breaks and has 52k miles on it hard to believe, i know but i buy used cars with low miles only, i can't even imagine trying to pay for a car now while saving for my future.
you know that's the same concern i had for the apple watch. i was just about to buy one, then i bought a mechanical one, which was a bit more expensive, but i can safely pass on to the next generation without worrying about the technology changes. a mechanical watch will still be a mechanical watch in 100 years time. and even if we have some type of apocalypse, you won't have to worry about charging it, and won't be left with dead useless outdated apps, unless of course, you are dead.
concerning your second point, yeah, it's hard to argue with that, you're right. your first point how ever, that's actually quite easy to explain. i lived the same conundrum you described. when i was in my early twenties, i very much wanted to buy a car that was priced at about $20,000. i went to the dealership, they told me essentially not a snowball's chance in hell. fast forward 15 years and now i'm the proud owner of 2016 subaru wrx sti, roughly $38,000 of awesome. so, what changed?
i agree with you on both counts. what's more fun is that my family only wants reliable cars that will never stop on the road. they're mad now that i am either recommending used models that are 3-8 yrs old is350, 4 runner or the last year of a previous gen model 2017 18 rdx and that i don't look for the latest flashy car, nor recommend any of those piles. how do you see the way the market is if you just want a car you can change the oil, tires, brakes, & have it go non-stop for 10+ yrs?
i dont see how having a touch screen in a car is in any way helping the driver, in the cars with only physical buttons, you rely on your muscle memory, which usually doesnt let you down. now that i have started to drive, i have realised how important it is to keep your eyes on the road, on the signs and on the cars around you at all times, having a complex touchscreen while you drive at 90-100kmph is definetly too complex, knowing that you only need a small mistake to make a big crash.
i would be lying if i didn't say the phone features in my 2013 hyundai sonata haven't been a distraction. i used to drive a truck before this car which wasn't much older a 2010 ford ranger, my dad and i swapped vehicles so now i have his sonata and he has the ranger, and as ford literally hadn't redesigned the ranger since 1997, i never had any of those same distractions with that truck. it's the unfortunate truth, despite the fact that my mother has insisted the sonata is a safer car.
i get the point you're trying to convey here, but the fact that many modern cars are now starting to have voice recognition so you don't have to even look or touch said screen in order to get whatever you may desire shows that, *maybe*, they aren't adding these things to scam you or whatever your tinfoil hat may be telling you. at the end of the day, looking at a screen in your dashboard will be far safer than looking at your phone, not to mention it's more convenient. makes zero sense?
this is why scotty kilmer says, never buy a used mercedes, the kraut engineers just load up these things with every bell and whistle. even my 92 ford and 93 chevy truck have glitches caused by creeping electronic failure. cal dmv is doing everything it can to get older vehicles off the road. bringing a pre-fuel injected vehicle up on a salvage title is a nightmare. believe me because i have done it. ask yourself this question, did windows not roll up and down before they were motorized?
after 2001, everything went to shit. i had a 2000 toyota camry bought second hand with 144,000 miles on it and it ran sweetly. i sold it big mistake and bought a prius, one of the worst and most dangerous cars ever made. very rough and clunky ride, requires a lot of effort in the steering wheel and merging into a freeway is a hazard. plus with the new front tilting headrests, it creates pressure on the spine. modern day cars are designed to break you physically, mentally and financially.
my father advised me to stick to the basics. an entry level mid-size car with as few bells and whistles as possible. it may seem boring, but i'll take boring over accessories breaking down. i own a 1999 camry ce base model with manual transmission. a c and heating with real sliders and tactile knobs. the same for the factory radio tape player. this seems archaic to many of my friends, but friends in the know are envious of this bare-bones car. upkeep and repair costs are extremely cheap.
there's something to be said for a cheaper or older car that just has the tried and true double din slot. i can buy any manner of stereo that has as much or as little features as i want. and then take it out and upgrade to a newer model as additional capabilities become available. my dinky versa just had a double din slot and i was able to put a touch screen in there with rear camera capability that works just as well as some infotainment system in a $40,000 car and it only cost me $180.
i'm not that kind of person doesn't want a change but think about this situation like for instance tesla car is no longer using gasoline because their purpose is to lessen the carbon dioxide have produce by a car and to help the world into global warming problem. how people are afford to buy expensive car like this that would cost you more than $60,000 so the solution is still the problem itself. moreover, people are still turns to gasoline because more cheaper than buying technology car!
you are absolutely correct. and i will never buy a newer vehicle because of it. my old vehicles from 96 & 97 are excellent. good solid switches and buttons, no touch screen bs, and i can fix most everything when i need to. the only problem i have is that many of the items needed to keep them running have been purposely made obsolete or discontinued by the manufacturer. so i'm stuck with aftermarket junk. but, that's still preferable to the rolling pile of computers and gizmos now offered.
funny i saw this. i work in the parts dept of a dealer, and me and my boss have talked about the cars now days just have too many distractions and also give a false sense of security. and while it is good for us we supply body shops it really is harmful to the world. i will keep my 2001 truck, with keys, dials, gauges, etc. i remember when i bought my first car, my father said, why didn't you get this or that new car not when i was 16, and i said, just something else to break. great video.
in the uk especially i think that insurance is the real problem. i had about £5000 in savings both from my job and what my parents saved i spent everything i had at 17 on a car and i spent more money on insurance than i did on the car. i spent £2200 on an 05 clio i could afford a newer,lower mileage car but not the insurance and £2400 on the first years insurance fully comp. the problem is if you arent insured fully comp and you get injured in a crash you aren't covered and you are ruined!
oh also, i don't keep my car more than 5 yrs, cuz after 5 yrs the car will be a money hole, all kinds of little problem will surface, so i change my car every 4-5 yrs, first of all i can still get a good trade in value, 2nd of all 5 yrs is already very long, tech will have improved a lot by then fuel econ, safety features, comfort tech, etc, but yea i totally agree with u on those touchscreens embedded so deep in how we control our cars, without the screen i won't be even to turn on the ac.
they cost around $0.05 each, and are always the first things to wear out, making fridges, ovens, washers, dryers, and yes even car's dashboards unusable. pony up the extra $0.10 a switch please manufacturers so our appliances can stop being disposable. oh wait. that's exactly what they want. a disposable economy where consumers are forced to constantly re-purchase a new $100-$1000 part or in frustration buy an entirely new appliance and ditch the old one not cars obviously, it's disgusting.
as far as stuff like yelp and other systems go those will get awful but the stuff that directly effects the car shouldnt be effective long term. i have a 2012 touch screen with nav in my honda and it works fine. i dont use the nav anymore other than just to see what street i am on but all the climate controls and everything else works. now i know newer cars are way more involved into the vehicle but i just dont see stuff that directly effects the car being that bad over long periods of time.
i agree, but if you know how to fix this not throw it away then perhaps there is that counterpoint. if you can afford a 50k volvo then you should expect these issues in the new or used market. if you are keeping your car long-term it is well worth it to fix and keep as long as it is reliable. not many touch-screens go bad on older vehicles and if they do they are not embedded. if you can afford a new vehicle at 40k+ then you should also expect the after-warranty issues that go along with it.
i had a 1999 mazda van for work.[80's design ear wheel drive and single ohc 12 valve non interference engine]i bought it at 130,000k and used it for 7 years.honestly all i ever did was change the oil and filter on it regularly.it had a carburetor and distributor, so no computer.no abs,no airbag,manual transmission,wind up windows.old fashioned sliding heater controls.always started instantaneously.after 17 years the rust got to it but i still sold it on to a russian guy.probably still going.
problem 1 is related to problem 2, to some extent anyways. the cost of new cars keeps going up and up and up because they keep adding all this expensive shit we're all better off without. compare the cost of a radio that has buttons and knobs to a radio that's solely touch screen. you're honestly better off with a good tactile feeling button knob radio as opposed to a touch screen that costs more, and requires your attention from the road just to do something simple like go to the next song.
when i purchased my 2013 brz i looked to see if it was on that dam data bus system. no it is not. the infotainment is completely isolated from all the other cars electronics. dropping in an aftermarket system is as easy as pie. the brz is just about as basic as a modern car can be. my next car. the tesla 3. will be loaded with technology that can not be easily changed. tesla is constantly updating and improving there products. they have over the air updates and options and a killer warranty.
yet folks snub their nose if a cars touch screen isn't big enough. safety tech could be in it's own category because it does save lives. i work at a volvo store now and clearly that's technology our customers put value in. at the same time, it generally is just mitigating bad driving habits. most accidents aren't, but i really don't see human nature changing either. it's pretty amazing how safe today's cars can be, but that does add both cost and future repairs. how about environmental tech?
i own a 2016 ford focus st1 base model. there is no touchscreen, no navigation or all those onboard apps and that's already on your phone. i stuck a garmin gps on the windshield. it's a 6 speed manual, so none of the at issues so many newer cars seem to have. it cost me 26k new. and it does one thing really well it gives you a great driving experience. screw all that fancy crap. the choices are rare, but you can find a decent new car that doesn't have all of those annoying bells and whistles.
if you wanna talk about crap technology and massive repair bills, get a german car like a vw for example. a simple window motor breaks and you gotta take it to a mechanic and spend a crap ton of money because special tools and parts are needed to work on them. if i recall, anymore mechanics recommend hondas and toyotas. relatively fewer maintenance intervals and when they do break they're usually cheaper easier to fix although newer cars in general require more and costlier maintenance work .
the answer is simple small kids need a small back bench because otherwise its to big for them. conclusion cars for a fmaliy with small kids have very small distance between back bench and front chairs. kids also want toys which emasn that they prefer a cheap car that drives ok when going to footbal practice etc. that is why car manufacturers are trying to persuade kids to buy their car by developing cars that fit with theor needs i.e small and cheap liek the fiat 500 and the toyota aygo etcf!
3 technology is a scam. lot of the tech is getting mandatory, and does reduce accidents. abs, pre-braking, lane departure, crumple zones 4 it cost a lot to fix it. yes, things cost money to fix now, having all vital functions on the infotainment is an issue, as if it break, you have to fix it. but if searching for moon music based on your posture function is broken. you fix it because you want need it, or you don't because you don't care, it almost sound like you cannot make up your mind here?
every summer i look after my friends dog while they are away when i first was doing it they had an 01 acura tl and an 02 odyssey. they were some of the first cars i drove and loved. years later i loved the odyssey so much i bought one for cheap and its amazing, even the tranny is awesome. its just right in terms of tech and maintenance. the maintenance costs have been so minimal which is a blessing for my low income and needing access to a personal auto not close enough to the city center now?
i agree with a lot of points made in this video. after working on a bunch of cars over the years, you look at some of these vehicles, when they hit the 5 to 8 year mark they're either going to have expensive solutions to fix things or the other big point you made no support. we have customers come in all the time asking for a simple map update or they want to make that sat radio button work on their head unit because the dealership says they have no solution. great video for awareness, thanks!
i have got a 12 sierra and it is the perfect amount of technology built into a truck. i am a heavy duty truck tech and our stuff is getting extremely complex. i don't find my truck intimidating. i feel confident in my ability to maintain and repair that truck to the 20 year old mark. the automotive world is getting ridiculous. the touch screen has got to go it is too much of a distraction to drivers. it is a hazard it isn't like physical buttons or knobs that you can memorize the positions of.
i love tech and how we can progress into the future. but it has a place and a reason. having to scroll 4 menu's deep to change the temp or fan speed is foolish and asking for a distracted driver. core vehicle functions should be physical controls you can manipulate without the need for thought or sight. it's like my subaru. i can control any of the phone connectivity options while the car is in motion, but i am locked out from changing the bass and treble while the car is in motion. really?!?!
but cars arent for customers, cars are build to sell. you need improvement to sell, a car that drives you 10 or more years isnt selling^^ a society without money needs working cars, because it save ressorces, but saving ressources doesnt sell on the long way. maybe you need laws do make it worth to build cars you can drive over one decade or livelong. i believe this would make a lot of people angry, because a car wouldnt be a status anymore but hey, then some of them would maybe ask what i am? .
i got a fully loaded '17 fiat 124 with a stick. love all the tech. japanese build qualityalso have a 1968 austin healey sprite aka mg midget love that car too. so basic. my 124 is my favorite car i've ever owned. but. then again. you see a ton of cars with way over the top shit like the touchscreen climate controls, etc. too much to breaki only put like 2000 miles year on my cars, if that. so i'll have my 124 forever. my '01 mustang bullitt gt i'm selling now just hit 30k miles. to each his own.
haha my '14 chevy impala limited lt 3.6l canada us made, 110k four years ownership to date as second owner bridgestone turanzas x7 @ $1250 front wheel hub control harness -revised length x2 $300 oil changes x11 @ $475 air filter x1 $40 cabin air filter $20 transmission fluid total flush job x1 $80 don't get a fucking honda, toyota, nissan, lexus, acura, dodge or any of the shit uk euro janky imports. some fords, gm and lincolns are just ok even with all their shortfalls compare to aforementioned.
it really has to do with kids these days myself included when i was younger, having a huge safety net to fall back upon. 1 live at home till 25-30's, not paying any rent. 2 not having to pay for food while living at home 3 not having to pay for cell phone service family plan 4 parents paying entirely for college don't have to take out loans so after college, kids who are able to find work mainly have to just pay for their own luxuries such as whatever cars they want. that's my break down at least
calling form 2018. no one can afford you pos status symbol. car makers such as ford are cutting the cars brands no more fiestas indeed. the crash saftey standards and pedestrian laws and what every liberal saftey bs law that could come out of california has had a huge hand at kill the car industry as well as inflation and narcissism. if any car maker besides kia could come out with something akin to a 92 honda civic ef that would be great. instead of forcing everyone into soccer mom inspired suvs.
i may dump the safest car in the world to save my life. i own one of the cars in this video that he recommended btw!, almost everything is in the middle dash touch screen. voice control is a disaster. many of the apps freeze or take forever to work. its like i own a car with a bad version on windows operating system running it. it is also the most distracting 6,000 lb vehicle i have ever owned. to change the temperature is a multi strep process in my xc90 yet the there are physical audio controls?
all the gadgets. then the driving impressions. how the car drives should be the primary importance. most people today treat thier cars as an entertainment system on wheels. first thing i look at when researching buying a car is 1 what size engine and how much horsepower. 2 handling. 3 cargo capacity. i prefer hatchbacks or wagons over sedans. you get so much more versatility with the former over the latter. 4 gas mileage. some people buy a car and they don't even know what engine is under the hood!
i say this shit to everyone i ever talk to about cars. still driving my 2010 civic si. nothing to go wrong, still runs awesome, no fucking bullshit distractions that i don't want. that clip where you were adjusting the climate control on the touch screen and then swiping sideways made my skin crawl. what a gross piece of shit that system is. poor people that have to live with it. totally un-needed and excessive. it is literally the biggest thing from keeping me from upgrading my car to a newer one.
my car has no parking sensors, and i park great. parking sensors are for those who don't know hot to use side mirrors and rear view mirror. and i drive for 12 years. adjusting the climate in the car using the touchscreen is stupid. a normal button is more effective. another stupid design is that the computer that controls the engine, brakes and steering is also responsible for the infotainment. hack that computer and the car is done and is a life threatening situation. why they don't separate that?
the 41 year old truck with zero computers. as long as you as a driver keep focused on driving i.e. no texting, talking, surfing the radio etc my biggest issue is the cars that give you all these gimics and distractions that you do not need. how long did we survive with two switches for heat cool and defrost warm. the manufacturers started pandering to a market that wanted everyrhing, but that market doesn't understand what having everything costs. both on a financial level and a technological level
as a car guy i'd be happier with a crappy shitbox from 2002 then a flashy 2016 model with innovative features. it is really ironic how all this technology is supposed to help drivers and make them safer when in fact they are merely stupid, pointless distractions that actual make people worse. they make people reliant on this stuff and their actual ability to safely and skillfully drive deteriorates. all a car needs to do is drive, carry people and objects. not be a flashy rolling computer on wheels.
new cars are more affordable today than in the past. my parents could not afford a new car until after all the kids left home. my father made good money as an engineer, but new cars have been for rich people for a long time. now, the problem is that people want what they can't afford. you can buy a dodge journey for the low 20's, but people want a gmc traverse instead for $40,0000. my wife and i have purchased 4 new cars in the past 10 years and we haven't spent more than $20,000 on any one of them.
what a pointless point and its not the problems of the modern car. for modern cars you have good and bad infotainment systems, its a matter of fact which infotainment system of the car you choose you can choose a morden car with analog combined with lcd which are great to help navigate and does not distract you anymore than the old anolog. about the cost of modern cars, not all of them cost $40k, you can easily get a decent second hand modern family car for $10k. this video its absolutely pointless.
you all watch too much tv, you all want to one-up the one-upmanship joneses, but what you don't realise is that the replacement has already been put in place for that piece of shit you've been brainwashed into believing you want by that nipping bloodsucking vampire you call a wife. get out of there, buy a classic car and restore it, however that's not without headaches either, the build in obsolescence was present right from the word 'go'. it's four wheels and a seat, a mobility scooter with a roof.
it has bosch k-jet mechanical fuel injection. when your computer dies, it may be cheaper to just throw the computer away and go 'old school' with everything rewired with actual switches and gages. the problem with maintaining new cars is that they are specifically designed so you can't work on them. to work on my 35 year old porsche, all i need is metric wrenches, a timing light, a volt-ohm meter, a 'color-tune' plug, air fuel ratio meter and cis pressure gages, to set up my fuel injection.that's all!
requiring cars for transport is a foundation of the usa kingdom of capitalizing upon others, and everywhere that models them. although more developed ing monocultural nations, who largely model usa capitalism, like in asia, provide their united people with excellent transport options. creating problems to sell solutions is exactly what it is and is the basis of everything in the usa. anything that creates problems, including encouraging massive domestic social conflict, creates more precious economy .
simple, people shouldn't buy things they can afford. a 2017 suv does the same job as a 2005 suv. if you get conned because of the fancy unnecessary accessories and trims they sell, you can only blame yourself. if repair is such an issue, learn how to do them yourself. granted this is not always practical, but those jobs that you do learn will save you. and it will give you a sense of pride and hopefully lead you to take better care of your car. we have to stop the age of consumerism and disposability.
that's not capitalism that's cronyism. there is no competition with the big 3 also they are under safety regulations from government as well as emissions standards. all of these cause cost to soar. true capitalism would still bring affordable cars but since the car companies and the banks are tied together they have no excuse to roll back tech that serves no purpose when customers are always wanting the loans esp with 0 percent and 0 percent down. why pickups went from the 30s to now over 80 thousand.
well, her 2004 300m has less than 80,000km on it 50,000 miles and frankly i feel better knowing she's got a car that will not just protect her in a crash but help prevent the crash. she doesn't drive that much, literally to church on sundays and the local grocery store. although i love the tech in the 200c, i totally agree with the complaint. nobody will update the stereo or anything, it is what it is and will never be more or less, and it was ridiculously expensive, but it didn't need to be financed.
100k miles is just broken-in on my cars. hyundai offers a 10 year warranty. the one area i'll concede you've made a valid point is in commitment to maintain the technology in the vehicle. manufacturers do need a game plan for how they provide software updates to infotainment systems. tesla has done a good job at figuring that out with over-the-air updates. but to play devil's advocate on this, there's also an argument for not investing a ton of time and effort into software updates for these cars. why?
i agree with you on the updating software, etc. that's something they need to step up and do, otherwise it's pointless. the resale value of these cars is going to be little to none, because like cell phones, etc. they'll be outdated in 2-3 years, if not sooner. that being said, i still enjoy and prefer the technology in them. the electronic safety and comfort features like adaptive cruise control, bsm, etc are must-haves for me, as i've lost the joy of driving anymore. traffic is just annoying anymore.
got into a good wreck about a week ago now it's jan of 2018 happy new year to me right. well i drive an 03 silverado 1500 ls love that truck 200k miles on it and until now i've only done minor things to the truck. i went looking at a decent used car after a few days of price checking and fact checking the vehicals i decided none of them are worth it i'll just keep fixing my old truck till i die i guess i can't see myself paying more then 10k for any vehical because it has a fucking screen in the dash???
seat belt lights and its fucking loud shouting at me 2 belt up while im pulling out of my drive way, sitting picking somebody up and the door open shouts at me giving me a headache, talking 2 somebody as im setting off and again cant hear people over the beeps. its got built in gps and eco tracker shit which if u open the door it shows the door is open blocking off all the interface so i cant park up, open the door and see how my eco driving has been or anything on the console, wtf retard did this shit?
today, you won't find one street that does not have a dacia parked somewhere. germans themselves can no longer afford these great brands, because they get so utterly expensive, that only rich people can buy it. if the average german wants to buy a new mercedes, they need to go into serious debt. and i'm also gonna tell you, the new cars are completely boring. people used to identify with their cars, be it a mercedes, bmw, a mustang. you name it. what difference is there between a volvo xc90 and a bmw x6?
capitalism feudalism for peasant slaves who think they are free with voting, the only voice capitalism hears is money. spending power determines how much you are heard by the gov. that's why the rich control everything if you were to stop paying taxes the gov. would care a whole lot more than if you were to stop voting. that alone says it all. they dont depend on an intellectual population but instead on sheeple who dont question anything. ask yourself what is america's #1 export to the rest of the world?
i just bought a 2004 gmc envoy xl with 160,000 miles. it is great. engine and trans run like new. i plan to keep it to 300,000 miles. i paid little enough for it, that i will gladly spend to upkeep it. i know i need shocks in 6 months. i will update it with a new radio with backup camera. if a car is going to be a throw away item, as you say, i don't want to spend that much for it. good thing is that the engines, trans, and drivetrains they build now will all last 300,000 miles or longer with good upkeep.
one problem is parents think because they have 2 kids and they need an suv. the following cars can fit 2 kids, mum and dad fine, they are cheap to run, cheap to buy. honda jazz honda fit toyota yaris toyota vitz nissan micra nissan march mazda 2 mazda demio if you need more room honda civic toyota corolla nissan pulsar mazda 3 subaru impreza suzuki swift so you can see one does not need a suv to take kids to school and get the shopping done. most of the cars listed would be less than 20,000 for base model
you're wrong about the software updates or you are talking to dealers that have no idea what they are talking about. pick volvo for example since you have them in the video. all you need to do is google volvo software updates an you'll get a list of the ones they have released in the past 3-4 years and what was fixed. the same applies to all premium brands. but you are absolutely correct that most buyers do not consider software support when buying cars and it's a mistake. thank you for pointing that out!
back in the 1970s my mom used to drive a 1966 amc rambler with the straight six engine, and let me tell you, there is not a lot under the hood of that car. so one day she needs to get her battery jumped by a mechanic neighbor and he pulls his buick electra 225 around, and when he lifts the hood she is embarrassed by the lack of amenities in her own engine. but that day, he gave her the best advice that's she's lived by for the past 40 years the more you have under the hood, the more there is to break down.
some manufacturers such as chrysler include redundant controls for heating and air conditioning, also my wife's 2015 jeep pretty much doesn't allow you to do anything but change radio stations and temp with the touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion. there is a lot of good technology in newer vehicles but there is a lot of bogus crap tech as well. i don't think 40k car market is intended for 20-year-olds but a vehicles price is a very subjective thing so it is really hard to say what's worth it or not.
buy with cash and spend what you want. just make sure you can afford the maintenance. if you can afford and want to spend 40k on a car, do it. personally, if i had that much cash to my disposal, i would think twice before dropping it on a car. people seem to have no problem being 40k in debt for a car, or even 20,30k. but if they had the cash they would think twice about their purchase. this is when your income comes into play. save cash for your car and buy a car that suits your budget. not rocket science.
non-radial tires?., inflation accounted for, modern cars are less expensive overall even taking into account 1~2 unexpected major expenditures which are less likely to happen on modern cars, $40k spent on a family sedan $30k purchase and $10k on maintenance and repairs today will get you 10 years and 150k miles and maybe one can get ~$2k for it in the end. i remember all those cars from the 70s and early 80s that fell apart as one approached 100k miles. the issue is in the first part of your video. college!
in relation to the technology point is, because of digital displays that show everything from speed to fuel to rpm, a lot of people are forgetting to turn on their headlights and only running daytime running lights at night. i had that problem with a mitsubishi i rented, the entire dash was lit and headlights appeared to be on, but it turns out that i had no tail-lights. i've seen police in my area do the same thing. previous cars you couldn't read the gauges out on the country roads if your lights were off.
readin people sayin that all they need is a running car that can go from a-to-b. yes to some people thays true. they could give 2 fucks wat car it is, wat it has, etc. but then theres the car community wich sees cars an a hobby, way of life, investment, etc. an even our views r gettin stripped away by the self driving cars. i love tech, i wanna so holograms instead of screens eventualy. an the self deicings cool but dont put it ina sports car. ima pay that money to race an i wanna b able to control it my way
thank god, allah, aries, or whatever. i'm not actually religious, but looking to the heavens out of tradition that a guy who looks very hip and techno is not only recognizing but laying down the truth about too much and or bogus technology in cars. not only is that a problem in many other products, but in cars it's downright dangerous. i'm a little bit confused though-- why say they need to update the software on the cars when we really need to say why have any software for certain functions with these cars?
have a 2011 honda accord with 86k on it, daily driver. had 1 warranty issue, vtc control, at 54k. it has a regular metal key. i don't like the push button start. and it had the regular maintenance, oil changes, brakes, tires, nothing wrong with it. today's cars had too crap to go wrong and cost you the earth. my car is the lx trim level, which it entry level. manual a c, seats. but i did put an aftermarket radio in it. overall, the car has been good to me, and i intend to keep it till the doors fall off, lol.
sorry guys, i make those for a living. but i can tell you the mechanical need for repairs and regular maintenance is much higher than the software need for maintenance. normally software does not have wear or need regular lubrication. software can have bugs from the start, but so much testing and safety guidelines effort is done in automotive software to avoid bugs as much as possible. much more than web applications or computer software. with time software can get dull and outdated, but would still function.
that's just crazy talk some one found a cook book from 1787, and they said you boiled bones for three days to make broth. who ever heard of something so crazy. simmering for three day. crazy i say. ah, that's how you make beef broth today. when you buy a car, you buy one that afford to fix, and you do the maintance your self. my wife's car's manuel said, do not change the head lights yourself. this is a job for a trained maintance expert. my said i better do as they say, who knows what different about my car?
there should be laws allowing manufacturers to sell directly to consumer, to stop the greed of dealerships there should be laws banning car manufacturers from making more than two or three variants and packages for the same car, so that they commit more into streamlining the experience and making cheaper parts and accessories for such vehicles and forcing them to stop robbing their consumers. there should be laws banning manufacturers from financing cars to unqualified buyers so that it prevents another 2007.
those should always be option for the people who want to stroke their ego and can afford those expensive options and repair prices. a good radio, navigation and electronic windows is all one really needs. working with technology everyday, touch screen freezes all the time and updates are necessary. manuals are more likely to last the life of your car and less costly to repair than these dual clutch autos. dual clutch should be an option, cvt should be an option. manual and regular automatic should be standard.
good video. here are a few things that annoy me about cars 1. visibility i wish there was a way to get rid of the a, b, and c pillars because they obstruct my view. when i'm inside a car, i feel like i'm in a can with windshields added as an afterthought. also, a lot of cars sit low to the ground which i don't like. i want 360 visibility without the use of a camera. a volvo concept from 2001 volvo scc tried to insert glass wedges into the a pillars so drivers could see through them, but they scrapped that idea.
agreed, i've been driving my 1998 bmw e39 5 series for over 12 years now because i just cant find anything to replace it with. everything i get in now has no proper key, no handbrake, nothing's in the right place, no simple buttons controls to do simple tasks. the modern mercedes c class is a case in point, everything's in the wrong place or doesn't work intuitively. its awful. yes you can figure it out and get used to it, but you shouldn't have to. its a car and should be the same as every other car. what next?
i bit the bullet this year and financed a brand new car. after 15 years of just buying what i could afford in cash. i'm not a wealthy person so ever car i have had has been over 10 years old. i suddenly realised one day what i was spending each month keeping these cars road worthy. now i spend the equivalent in loan payments and the manufacturers warranty takes care of any faults with the car. the difference now to when i was younger is one, i known better and two, my bank history is good enough to get approved.
the problem with most electronics is they become obsolete quickly and it is uneconomic to repair them. is aerospace, where systems need to run for decades with no issues, many electronic systems are redesigned every 4-5 years due to original components being unobtainable. no car manufacturer will do this. for long term ownership you are best getting are more common model, then at least there may be spares from scrapped vehicles for a while. alternately get something really old and make sure the bodywork is good.
fact is technology is way too much for people these days to handle,they think everything is just there,and you press a button and it does what it is supposed to,but if it wears out they don't get that it costs money to fix it,basically hey have dumbed down society so much through chemicals and food additives that they have turned most people into complete morons,and putting a machine of this complexity in their hands is like giving a monkey a gun, and so you end up with mechanics being stabbed. morons i tell you.
it's not necessarily wrong to have a short life cycle on cars. that might be a very efficient way of handling things. for new everyday vehicles at least. the problem is that they want to charge you for the old value of a full priced car. but what you get is only an appliance, with a few years planned obsolescence. these things should have an extremely low cost. somehow we keep paying so much for these cars, that the business doesn't need to change anything. they are quite happy selling us crap for too much money.
2006 vauxhall astra 1.7 tdci break estate, 230.000km and counting. maintenance once a year and replacing worn parts with new ones along the way. chain engine, doesn't break. lots of space, fitted 16 grip tyres, no tuning would like to ecu chip it for 20hp more though, cruise control, abs, cd player. that's all i need. still runs 190kmh at a good day, fuel consumption average is only 5.1l 100km. i pay €450 year insurance belgium, one fuel up +900km travel distance. stands outside all the time, no garage. i love it.
even though my car is 16 years old it just cost me $500 to have it fixed when the ignition lock broke because it's got an immobiliser, and only a technician can fix it. in the old days i would have got a new lock at the parts store for maybe $25 and fixed it myself in 10 minutes. i dread to think what high tech horrors are going to be in my next car, which will obviously be a more recent model. i was at the mercy of a main dealer which is the only place with the gear to re-program my car's computer to the new key.
these are not inherent problems, but rather factors you have to work with around. cars are not cheap, but automakers aren't intentionally trying to price you out of owning a car that would be self-destructive to their own bottom-line. all the fancy tech that they stuff into cars now has just as much to do with the customer as the car company. i've been at the dealer while sally soccer mom is more interested about if the vehicle has park assist and in car wifi than what the drive-train or engine the damn thing has!
i've long come to the realization that i will never be able to own a new car, and that it frankly would be unwise to try. they're so full of useless bullshit nobody needs and very few want that will do nothing meaningful except break, then cost a fortune. all new cars today are only practical for the wealthy, period. this leaves folks like me hoping our old kia sportages and pt cruisers will last another 14 years. it's completely fucked. it makes one wonder how long the auto industry will be able to live like this.
bad video. these excuses and problems you claim that are the fault of the manufacturers is actually all the faults of the consumer. they tell you not to fuck with the touch screen while driving. they do not force you to buy top of the line models. nobody put a gun to your head and forced you to buy a sports car fully loaded, you chose to. there are 10-15k alternative vehicles which do the primary function of getting from point a to point b. if you cannot afford the maintenance, that is your fault for buying the car.
a friend of mine, a mobile mechanic who does my car has told me one important thing about modern cars they are purposely designed to make them as difficult to repair as possible. if you can repair a car you don't buy a new one, if you don t buy a new one, lost sales. if you can't repair the car, then the manufacturer wins. my first car in the 70's was a ford escort and you could almost totally dismantle it with a few hand tools and a hoist. modern cars cannot easily be repaired without a full workshop and a computer.
i pretty much hate all the complicated stuff that comes on new cars. every time my wife and i rent a car while on vacation, it seems like we waste alot of time figuring out how to use all the useless expensive crap the manufacturer's larded on to the vehicle. then when i get back home, i get to drive my old 1960's car, where i can actually hear the engine run and feel the road and know for sure that i don't ever have to take it to some shop and get nailed for another 1000 bucks for a repair. i can do all of it myself.
you don't need to spend $1,000+ on a built in gps option. you don't need heated seats in your economy car. you don't need touchscreen climate and radio controls. you're all falling for the manufacturers traps. they put this stuff in to make more money on you at the time of vehicle purchase and when it breaks and you have to pay them for replacement parts if not labor too, i'm in my early 30's and cannot understand why so many people don't care about being in debt up to their eyeballs. who wants to be a slave to money?
100% in agreement. my first car in united kingdom was a triumph herald, 13 60 with four-on-the-floor. its few features were all manually operated. you didn't need parking cameras because you could see all four corners perfectly and it had a 25 ft turning circle. the whole hood and front wing assembly hinged forward in one piece giving great access for diy servicing. you could sit on the tire and do your plugs and points and there was even a handy, full-width tray ahead of the windscreen for your tools and a mug of tea!
i've been railing against the ever increasing tech in cars for years. seriously, i don't need retracting mirrors, a silly motorized lift gate or auto leveling suspension. my wife and i make a decent living and there is no way we could afford to buy one, let alone two $50k vehicles. i always wonder who is buying theses new cars when as a consumer with a mid six figure household income it's a pipe dream. we drive, and will continue to drive 10-15 year old japanese cars and suck it up on the rare occasion that they break.
some asshat engineer is going to hear this and stop me from being able to quickly interact with the touchscreen just to get done what i need to get done while traveling. they're going to force me to jump through stupid fucking hoops everytime i touch the screen or i'm going to be fumbling with my phone trying to hold onto it and create an even larger danger risk than if they would just let me search for a god damn gas station. do it once to cover your company's ass, and then let me be an adult and make adult decisions.
i replaced my 96' s10 blazer dd with a 12' cruze dd, after working out mpg repair vs. loan payments+full coverage, it was nearly even because i commute 70 miles per day. i say nearly the same because the cruze has 100 airbags vs. 2 air bags 20 year old in the blazer. also improved regulation and design software went into the cruze and similar cars i should add. overall i feel safer than that old blazer. edit not to mention 1.25 million cruze's were sold in the usa lots of parts cheap. 2014+ focus head in same direction.
cost yeah, but quality sucks. the materials used are so poor quality. plastic cracks, aluminum breaks, and the little flimsy engines are stressed far beyond the limits they're capable of. any milage savings you might get over the old cars, is gone with just one catastrophic failure. i had a computer glitch completely destroy an engine, and though it was under warranty, they didn't fix the computer that caused it. my next car will be an old frame off restoration, with a small block chevy, 2 barrel carb, and 4 speed stick.
i can sort of agree with the pricing but cars come with so much on them now even standard that the price of entry is not bad. sure cars seemed cheaper in the 80s but that meant things like ac or a cd player were expensive options not to mention you were financing at around 13%. now you get 0% thought nothing is ever truly 0% on a kia forte for example which goes for $23k new. good warranty, all of the basic options one could ever want or need and good little car all around that won't cost much to maintain over the years.
i think the real problem is the lack of basic cars. i mean a new honda civic today is a very different read more advanced than a civic from 15 years ago, so of course its going to be more expensive to buy and own. i guess since future car buyers are living in a much tougher economic time and have less disposable income sooner or later the car industry will catch on and make cheaper cars, question is going to be what the catch will be on those. i really doubt they are going to be of the same quality as a 2000 honda civic.
very right. unfortunatly we keep buying the shit, not giving just ourselves the right incentives when buying or living out lives but we pass it on to other adults and our kids. and most important we complain about all it not changing but in the end both the corporations mede up by people in the end as the consumer is in error. as long as we are unwilling to change this self destructive dynamic. shit wil hit the fan more and more and the fan will spin harder and harder dispersing the shit until point of entropy is reached
all this modern tech is to attract new buyers and drive the cost up. they're not offering updates because they're only building these cars to last the length of the warranty. also making alot of the stuff out of different plastics which is easier to dispose of. great thing about plastic is it's lighter and cheaper to manufacturer but, doesn't withstand natural elements like sun rays, acid in the rain,salt, severe cold and severe heat. becomes brittle, cracks,fades. how many cars do you see with faded out headlight lenses?
so sad and true. in 2014 we were turned off from buying new citroen c4 grand picasso exactly because of that lcd screen in the first place. than all gems they put in. mostly useless junk. but they combine that with important stuff in packages. so you can't really not to choose them. than navigation updates are expensive as hell. etc. a nice car totally bloated with junk technology which you want to turn off first day let say radar tempomat on that particular vehicle which does not work properly and it is dangerous to use.
the problem is not technology, its poor build quality. toyota shows precisely that you can have technology and reliability in one package. yes, we could have cars that are like tanks, at the cost of important electronic safety features because theres been nothing but investment in build quality. the blame goes to the greedy upper management that are turning cars in to throwaway products and want to keep the earnings for themselves. pretty much any car company could easily ramp up the build quality and still swim in money.
i did not expect this video to be accurate, but you nailed it. there's a lot of people that when buying a used, older car they choose ones with less electronics, because those electronics will fail. grounding wiring issues are extremely prone to happen, because metal corrodes, critters chew wires, and beyond that computer chips can fail. at that point you either live without it, or spend the time money to fix it. the more integrated the electronics are, the less likely you're going to be able to drive the car without them.
i hate the touch screen controls. they force you to take your eyes off the road. t, they are confusing and hard to use nearly impossible in some cars if you aren't familiar with them and they can be glitchy. all the extra functionality is a joke.if you want an entertainment system for the kids, there are lots of options for $100 that don't interfere with your $40k vehicles operation. i am hoping that i never have to buy a car with this crap. i could afford all manner of fancy vehicles but i don't want them for this reason.
i hate infotainment solutions in cars. hell, i hate the mandatory backup camera because there is no replacement for turning around and looking at what youre doing. the reason i hate these things is because you can’t upgrade to an aftermarket solution which is usually better and cheaper. i like the new miata, but the the weird radio and screen kills it. you cant replace that with a single or double din radio. i dont need gps in my car radio. my phone has better and more up to date maps. it all hits me as planned obsolescence
it's true. most modern cars have so much candy integrated in them that i wonder why they even bother to put wheels on them. then the stuff quits just as you're trying to go somewhere. the sad part is that it's almost impossible to find a new car with the lack of features that aren't needed to make it reliable. while i don't mind having a computer controlled ignition and fuel system, i don't want to drive a box of computers, which is what modern cars have become. to me, luxury is physical comfort, and a good analogue stereo.
im 19, i bought a used truck that was in very good condition. its a 99 dakota with only 130k miles and was a southern truck. i live in ny and i see dakotas everywhere, usually rusted out or rusting. my mother was telling me to buy a certified used car and take out a loan to build some credit, now that isnt a horrible idea but at the time i didnt even have 10k in a savings account and i spent 3600 on the truck. i didnt want to have to pay off a loan, pay my insurance, and have little no cash in my bank account for the future.
there are some good cars out there for under $15k with electric windows, ac, good audio, and automatic trans. you had to pay top dollar for that in the 70's and 80's. so cars have actually improved for the consumer and all cars are much safer than the used to be. you still pay more a moonroof, high-power engine, and unnecessary electronics, but if you don't need it, you don't have to fork over the money for it. my advice for longevity. stay away from the electronics, and stick with a 4 cyl engine i.e., simple longer lasting.
i've got a 2012 hyundai elantra that i bought new at the end of 2011. about a year ago i noticed the button for the xm radio was getting a little weird and i lived with it until it got really bad. i knew a replacement nav system new from hyundai would be expensive but i didn't think it would be $4,000 expensive. not including labor to install. so i hopped on ebay, found a used nav unit in good shape for $225 and swapped it out myself using a $12 trim removal tool kit from harbor freight. new parts with dealer install pricing?
the problem is that people barley know how to do proper maintenance on their vehicles. you know air filter cabin, spark plugs, cleaning the air throttle, changing the valve cover gasket and just proper engine maintenance. and when it comes to technology, just dont get the interior wet. wouldn’t want those computer components under your seat or carpet getting destroyed over hot lattes or salt water from the beach. and everyone should know that things get outdated as time passes by. heck, even us if we don’t keep up with times.
your so correct on of all this, and the technology built-in and how they are not updating them. this will become a huge ordeal when this starts to happen more frequently in the next few years. the software will become a huge deal when buying a used car and i think cars with this technology will have a even greater depreciated value because of alot of basic core function will not be able to be changed due to the software and or app being out-of date and no updates available and if there is one it won't work on current phone's.
the biggest myth in the car industry today is the driver aids, the cameras and sensors are for driver-less technology and you are testing it for them. throttle by wire, brake by wire, steering by wire the push for automatic transmissions in everything. they sell it as convenience and safety. next will be the insurance companies offering discounts for all this crap. then punish you for not having it. then penalize you for even driving your own car and not letting the safe computer do it for you. its just around the corner folks.
there are plenty of used cars around for $10k or less and they usually have sub-100k miles on them. with some care, you can take a car up to 200-250k if you don't run it into the ground. the problem is, a lot of 20 year olds, especially guys, love to hotrod with the things, even 4-door sedans which is just stupid. if you're 20 and you're starting your life and you need a car. get the local classifieds. check the used dealer lots. use some common sense. don't go out and get a brand new car. you simply don't need a brand new car.
a lot of people in the comments complain about technology breaking and being unreliable first of all i want to address something, technology is not gadgets and electronic stuff, technology is everything that innovative, for example metal tools instead of wooden were technology back at those days back to the point, every time new technology comes out people hate it and cry about it i am pretty sure when cars came out people said oh they will blow up and kill you, this thing is slower than my horse its basically the same right now
i should say that i have never bought a brand new car because of all the gadgets that they always have. also, i'm a mechanic by trade and i see these cars when they have been bought used by some poor, unsuspecting young person who was told it'll only cost $150 to fix. then they bring it to me and i have to watch them freakout at what this crap costs to really fix. the only time i visit a dealership is when i'm getting proprietary parts. because you can't go to napa to get a replacement infotainment system that's dealer only hun.
i wish seatbelts were more comfortable with padding like backpack straps. also, i think the part of the seatbelt that comes across the chest should contain a small pocket to keep insurance card and drivers id. when police ask for id, just get it from your seatbelt across your chest. you won't look suspicious and the cop can see where your hand is while reaching for your id. i just think it's time to re-think the automobile and it's ecosystem fuel, maintenance, registration, insurance, etc, simplify while giving us more for less.
i love my car as if i want to change the radio station or adjust the temperature its all done by buttons the next model up its controlled by a i-drive system which i hate as it is really slow and he's right you can't change them out and sometimes its far to expensive to fix. i have a 03 bmw x5 3.0i and it drives better than most new cars, it has more safety features and is really quite inside plus i paid only $9,000 aud for mine as it needed new tyres and it has only done 135,000km in its time, its in near mint condition as well.
i'm sure with some research you can find ~ 20000$ new car for a family 1-2-3 kids + parents, if you are looking for 1-2y old car you can drop down 10-15% easy. all this prices are conservative. other than that, who forces you to get all that fancy shit touch screen and other non standard features, usually you can price up car 50%-70%-100% more with all add on's, but its not a necessity, you can live without them. or if you are quite stupid and want to show off than you should buy it and think omg what will i buy in grocery store.
these new cars do everything to disengage the driver from what is most important the driving experience, and i don't even say that from a enthusiast perspective, but from a safety perspective. let's face it, cars today are designed with planned obsolescence they're not built to last the more of this unnecessary crap there is, the more there is to break. you can keep all that infotainment crap, i'd rather have a car where the performance is the entertainment, rather than nonsense one shouldn't be messing with while you're driving.
ehh. i'm 50 50. i think from the beginning cars should have been built to have certain digital technologies integrated into them, but cars having technology integrated into them standard is somewhat different. if the manufacturer isn't specifically using technology that has long term technical support long term being the 3-7 year life of the vehicle that's not really a useful. my problem, at that point, is that older vehicles, which were built to the same planned obsolescence standard, aren't getting less worn out as time goes on.
i agree. i don't like these new cars that have a big touch screen in place of the radio and climate controls. they are laggy, and you have to dig through menus just to change the fan speed or temperature on the climate control, or even just the radio. it just contributes to distracted driving. cars that have the touch screen on the center stack is a deal breaker for me. i like the old way which worked great and was easily to use, most buttons you have muscle memory for in which you don't have to take your eyes off the road to use.
i still drive my 1992 celica gt convertible. the only car i have. i've repaired myself all the little things. i change the oil myself of course. at 70k i took it to a shop that that changed all the belts. at home i replaced the radiator with an aluminum double row. it was only 20 more than a single. all the tools i bought from harbor freight. i keep a written record of everything replaced and fixed. there is a good feeling about repairing the car yourself. buy a mid 90s toyota. buy a haines repair manual. stop making car payments.
if you think about it. all of this technology is keeping people employed. the student that goes to college to become a computer programmer. in the long run things that don’t seem important are important for the simple reason that it gives people jobs. in other words. it keeps the world moving.i have a car with navigation voice command xm radio, but i have an iphone which i can connect to hear music or call without earphones and navigation in my phone. there are a lot of useless things but without them we would go into a depression.
we got 7 years ago a second-hand isuzu d-max for just 7,000 euro in thailand. it works like a new one till now. though we changed a battery 2 times, tires, and once there were problems with a conditioning system freon went out. to the moment we got 250,000 km. fuel efficiency is just great it was more than 14 km per liter and after a change of engine oil to my formulations it is almost up to 20 km per liter. cannot say sure as measurements are not precise enough. so, buy only japanese brand cars produced before 2007. new cars suck.
i learned how to operate a car at 18. i don't need all that help that modern cars have. i learned how to drive in the years after that, certainly don't need all the help modern cars have. besides the ever increasing costs, the complexity and distractions of devices we don't need, it also takes the fun out of driving. soon we are nothing but passengers in a car that drives itself like a bus, or train. but much more expensive. and much less reliable. cars are fashion now, we need a new one every few years. like cellphones and clothes.
the big problem with us the consumers is that we have forgotten the actual purpose of a car. we are too susceptible to marketing. i drive a newer car and i'm telling you that just reversing into a wall would cost me two grand to replace the bumper with all the sensors and crap. yeah i have insurance but the point is that if we understood the real purpose of a car, you would realize that having to call a tow truck cause your bumper fell off is just ridiculous. with my first car, i would just throw the bumper in the boot and carry on.
these are big reasons why i like my 97 and 2001 cars. i learned how to actually drive checking blind spots, not being an idiot and tailgating, parts are dirt cheap part of that is because mine are gm cars in the end and they tend to reuse things and i have actual physical controls. i can switch from ac to heat with one hand and not looking at the controls at all. a touch screen is too finnicky to pull that off usually. all i had to do was drop in a cheap $20 radio with bluetooth and i got the good of the new with the good of the old.
i have 3 cars, and the youngest of them is from 1988. the other 2 are from 1986 and 1975. all 3 of them i can easily do service and repairs at home. open the hood on a modern car on the other hand and you are greeted with plastic covers. not very user friendly. with the amount of electronics in modern cars i would be surprised to see them in working order at the age of 20 and older. electronic starter buttons, touch screens, digital instrument clusters. its going to be a mess when those things fail, and they will fail sooner or later.
it costs a lot to repair because mechanics are charging 100$ an hour. an hour just to diagnose. half of the cost of repair is labor alone, plus according to this guy old cars didn't have technology lol. even your 2000 honda civic has eletronics in them and no you don't need software updates. your hardware doesn't last longer because you got a software update. imo the biggest problem with modern cars is mechanics just aren't keeping up. i would fix a car myself if i had the patience to remove stuff like the front bumper and put it back
people aren't having children, because of the price of inflation. also, they have to choose between a child, babisiter, bemefits for the child etc. so most are deciding that they rather have a nice phone or a nice car, but can't have both, baby and car. it's just a matter of time, we have what switzerland is having, a shortage of people. america is just greedy all around. i should know, i was born in nyc and still live here. i feel so sorry for the younger generation. inflation doesn't happen on it's own, we are doing it to ourselves.
1st world problems. i bet you bitch about everything. you don't have to get a $40,000 car. only the nicer models cost that much. you can still get models that cost about the same as they did in the 90's with inflation. or get base models of the more expensive cars, without as much tech and features, which would still have way more features than what cars came with whenever it was before you thought cars got too expensive. average price of a car in 1997 was $21,000, which is $35,000 today. starting price of a camry is currently $23,800.
i think basic cars today are actually more affordable than in the past. some safety features should be welcome. eg abs, seatbelts, cruise control, crumple zones infotainment and navigation should be set before you set off. voice active controls allows you to keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel. 😝 i remember driving bricks on wheels in the 70s and i'm happy to be driving today's cars now. use the technology don't misuse it. i do agree that some features are totally unnecessary but generally were driving safer cars.
pretty useless addition in the movie, like the useless additions in modern cars, haha. i've been driving a land rover defender for 9 years now. super basic, unchanged for the last 60 years or so and i'm loving it. it will be driving for the next 35 years for sure. no more buying of a new car for me people don't understand that the modern day car is polluting many times more then one of those old dinosaurs. because you buy a new one every couple of years. it's more polluting to make a car then to drive it all it's existing life, people.
some thoughts on the subject. yes, cars, trucks, suv's, etc are all getting way too expensive. i also agree that they are cramming too much tech into vehicles and not allowing the option for a simpler, stripped down version. i would like to see vehicles designed with ease of maintenance and repair in mind. i'd also like to comment on the fact that you brought up capitalism. in true free market capitalism, we would see new car companies popping up with cheaper cars that are easier to maintain. what is preventing that from happening now?
actually a lot of the systems are automatically disengaged when driving. i have a dodge charger rt. they wont let you look up stuff, like locations why driving, so they are safe. and when i've been in the middle of no where 5tey have helped find gas stations, good restaurants and places to sleep. they are useful. and just lease the cars, when warranty are up. get a new one, it's much cheaper that way. and get a better job. people work very hard to build this stuff and should get paid for there products. cars are more reliable than ever.
he actually makes a great point, call me crazy but a big reason i got an fr-s over the miata is the head unit in the fr-s is replaceable and i'm thinking of putting in an a new hi-res unit. the miata is totally screwed with that tablet thing, my mom got a new cx-5 and it's unit, like the miata, already looks like shit but there is no way to put something better in. it's pretty sad, imagine it in another 3-5 years it will look even worse and i can get another unit for the fr-s. totally kills any chance of it being a classic interior wise
i think a lot of technology in cars is not even needed. i argue that the technology on the cars have made people worse drivers because people have this false sense of security and drive more reckless and have deadlier accidents. i see it all the time around in the baltimore dc area. cars are just phones nowadays basically where after the contract is up, people get rid of it and gets the newest one. sad state of affairs for us enthusiasts. i prefer the cars from the 90s and 2000s because it was simplistic and spartan. easy to fix as well.
nice video, it was quick and to the point. i felt exactly the same when i purchased my new z about 6 months back. i had the option to add the tech package which would include a small touch screen infotainment system with a backup camera for $3500 dollars. i said no and couldn't be happier with my choice. all of the controls for ac radio and whatnot are nice buttons that have a nice click feel to them. the z is definitely spartan when it comes to the interior design and there is almost no tech whatsoever, just me, the stick, and the road.
he's absolutely right about this stuff. at the moment i have three cars, a 1997 maxima, a 2000 nissan xterra, and a 2009 hyundai genesis. the two nissans are older cars and so they don't have very much technology. i keep them around partly because i love the simplicity of function on the dashboard. the genesis, however, is a lot newer and since it's a luxury car it's got a lot of technology, much of which i never use. for example, although i've owned the car for nearly four years i have never once used the on-board navigation system. why?
i have 4 cars, a 1995 lincoln town car which was my first car, a 2006 dodge charger a 1987 chrysler fifth avenue and a 1990 gmc vandura and honestly i love the old ones better because they ride smoother, cheaper to fix and they have everything you need in a car. none of that techy stuff. my charger is always breaking down and its a fortune to get it repaired. whenever one of my old cars break down i usually fix it myself because every thing is right there. not only that but i don't have to worry about car payments or high insurance rates.
i'm with you on the dislike of everything being behind a touchscreen but not quite on why cars all have that now. while it's easy to say they do it so they can sell you even more tech to save you from the distraction, look at what consumers are clamoring for. you've got a relative minority of drivers as opposed to commuters who see cars as appliances that are begging manufacturers to put back tactile controls but you've got a majority of people who just like the shiny. and the biggest example those people point to for the shiny they want?
also, if you can't afford a new car you get a used car. you can get a decent used car for 10 grand or less if you go back a few years. an average new toyota is like 30k, maybe 35 if you go for luxury models. you can regularly find year old cars for 20-25k or less if you shop around. go even older and you can get a decent car for less than 15k, sometimes less than 10k. also, you had to take your hands off the wheel to control the aircon or radio in cars 30 years ago, technology didn't add that with touch screens. you know what they did add?
for me ,there is another big problem with modern cars and that is they don't have '' bumpers '' which means simply if you are lucky enough one day to have a low speed impact it would be probably the worst nightmare due to the amount of defects with headlights and other accessories besides the radiator supports and such. damn these plastic bumpers covers and how low they are on protecting my expensive front and rear stuff. how much what ever you do to fix a low speed impact no matter what ,the car will never becomes like what it was before.
i have to agree. when growing up, we did not even want power windows because it was just something else to go wrong. i have been saying for some time that all the touch screens and other devices will not last and there will be a day of reckoning. folks, all things wear out. as he says, look at your phone and the wear that occurs. price a used vehicle and something that is 8-10 years old is costing $25k because it cost $50-60k to start with, and it is at the age where problems are going to start piling up. i suppose we are basically trapped
the answer is government regulations. monopolies in capitalism are only possible because of government. if there were no government regulations, then there would be nothing to prevent the flow of fresh ideas into the auto industry. think about it, vehicles have to be so eco-friendly yet still don't get much better fuel mileage than they did 20 years ago. they also have to adhere to all kinds of strict safety standards. all of those things make the price go up and also eliminate the possibility of new companies having any chance at success.
the technology in cars is a big problem. cars depreciate quickly even without it but the technology in cars will make them depreciate even more quickly as it becomes obsolete. sometimes these systems have such poor ux design that these new cars look dated from the moment they come out. the goal of technology should be to simply the users life, which means making less 'stuff' necessary. like how smartphones made gps devices, calculators and ipods unnecessary. this is what automakers and smart home designers seem to have not figured out yet.
duuude, your number 2 is the biggest bullshit i've heard in the past 10 minutes. rear ending has been around since vehicles existed and is not caused by center consoles. what is more, nobody said you have to use the apps that are available while moving, you can search for a restaurant by the side of the road or on a gas station. and if you are the kind of douche that will browse the center console while driving even if you didn't have those features on your car you would be using your phone. so that capitalism, consumerism is 100% bullshit.
i totally relate to all of this. also i would add a 3rd reason being basic functionality is now being overlooked in favour of the junk gadgets being put in. things like not being able to reach the ac or heater control to demist your windscreen while at the same time the pedals are too close to even extent your legs, like the basics of control distances and locations are totally wrong for a human beings anatomy. also seems you can't get good seats in many cars now that actually allows your back to fit into it forcing you to sit sideways lol.
well during 90s car manufacturers figured out it is not profitable to create cars that can last for 20-30 years. they do not update software, integrate everything into central system, make it compact, cheap to produce and not so easy to repair so you would buy a new one in couple of years because that will be the cheaper option for you. bmw and mercedes officially said their products are designed to last 6-7 years so we can not whine about 10y o cars not running well. according to them those cars are only good for a junk yard. so what to do?
i wish i could give this a hundred likes. so true. i own a 1996 car, a citroen xm. in general i love technology when it works for me but not when it works against me. at the time the xm was the car with the most advanced suspension and roadholding technology available computer aided active hydropneumatic suspension, since then citroen have removed all of that stuff and joined the info-taiment circus as well. for me however what really counts is technology which keeps me involved in concious driving, not gizmo's which actually keep me from it!
the way things are going is that you won't actually buy a car anymore but lease one. a mitsubishi lancer base model computer replacement cost easily between $6-7 000 because of the reconfigure required. they're forcing consumers to go into yearly payments to rent out cars instead of owning one. simply because like what the video says, they are putting shit into cars that when they break, the owner could no way afford to fix. i drive a mercedes from the mid 90's as it's classy simple and the parts are surprisingly plentyful and cheap for merc.
this could easily be a top 10 list. i have been permanently relegated to the used car market due to price, so the more tech is put in new cars, the more broken tech i will inherit. a huge issue for me is the level of catastrophic failures cars have due to high volumes of the same engine or platform in car lines. if 90% of a popular engine suffers a head gasket failure at 70,000 miles, the used car buyer is going to bear that cost. same goes for systems like abs or as you mentioned, touch-screen controls. you should explore this topic further.
i'm totally with you on hating when car functions are integrated into an infotainment system. i have a 7 vw system, which works well, it receives free updates from the dealer regardless of me using another shop for maintenance. i chose the non facelifted vision of my car model so that i wouldn't have to give up physical buttons in favour of a larger touch screen and an electric hand brake. i just could not live with an electronic hand brake on a manual transmission car. i drive a seat leon, which is identical to a vw golf mk7, except visually.
no, its more technology meaning more money, and call me crazy, but more of an opportunity for big brother to tap into your vehicles monitoring systems. people will continue to buy into the idea of all this and for one reason theyre all about impressions. idiots will stay in debt up to their eyeballs just as long as corporations continue to keep them brainwashed into thinking, this is what u need in order to have new friends, keep your old ones, and be an noticed member of society. must be nice to show off in something flashy, but ya know what?
one anecdote that really drives it home my wife's mercedes ac stopped working and it cost $2,300.00 for a new control unit everything mechanically was fine, my old jeep cherokee uses simple cables and a few simple switches to control the heat ac system, and it actually works better than the auto-climate control system in my wife's mercedes. the fan motor in my jeep went bad a few years ago. a brand new replacement from the dealer was $150.00 and fixed it i would not use the chinese parts store replacements, which cost a lot less but are crap .
savage geese i have a 96 ford f150 with 5.0l windsor v8 with 203,407 miles on it and it's still going strong. the only thing i replaced on my truck was the starter but other than that mostly was just simple maintenance and cleaned out the transmission fluid just to get rid of the shuttering it was making and it hasn't had a problem ever since. those modern car lovers can call me a redneck or a hillbilly but my 96 f150 will outlast anything you see on the road today and plus my truck looks better than anything you see on the road today as well.
that's well into bmw 5-series territory. you can get a basic car for under $20,000 and there are a wide range of new cars between $20,000-30,000. if this is still too much, you can easily buy a warranted used car for less than $10,000. that's still a big expense for a young couple with other debts, but it certainly compares favorably with the cost of a house or even the cost of health insurance. and in many areas, a car isn't a luxury purchase. without a car, you're basically stranded. love them or hate them, a car is pretty often a necessity.
there are cars cheaper than 40000$. the cheapest new car you can buy is 8500$. from that point, the 8500$ you can go to what point you want, nobody is saying that you have to buy a bmw or a mercedes or audi. because at 40000$ you or i can buy 2 brand new bmw witch is insane for a person who is in highschool or collage or university or working no matter what time in history or the state of the economy, i'll be content with only one brand new bmw i'm content at 32 with my 11 year old car that's still driving fine to eat my dust silly modern cars
example the price of a new civic lx hatch is 20k. you can't go to the dealer and get it for that price. they use all of their tactics to shamelessly sell it to you for 22k 23k 24k and play all their games like i've got to talk to my boss and make you sit and wait. i can go to best buy walmart home depot etc. and buy stuff off the shelf for the price listed but nooo, at the stealership i have to deal with all the nonsense trickery and storm out. car dealerships are rated as the worst customer experience in the united states. a badge well earned.
bought a new jeep renegade with $1200+ option for a bigger screen and sat nav radio. stupid me. my cell phone can do it better for cheaper. it was hard to get a option loaded car without the better screen function. thank you for publishing this. the consumers and reviewers should really try to let manufacturers that this stuff is garbage. people should get it that apps like yelp and pandora and navigation are not so necessary need to be in car electronics. smart phones can do it better and more efficiently and updating a smart phone app is easy.
i am particular for the cost of cars these days and agree 100% with the notion of affordability in acquiring and keeping them. i think this is why brands like alfa romeo have the 4c in production. on the tech aspect, someone will make alot of money figuring out how to update these systems and even designing adapters for tablets that can run the key functions hvac, radio, etc on something like android. i know mazda is using android software like you mentioned so their infotainment will probably be the first to see this implemented from a tinkerer
dude, fuck this video and the whining from the comment section. grab a wrench and a multimeter and fix it yourself. the real problem is kids these days are afraid to take things apart. even modern cars still use traditional mechanics. and that fancy dash or navigation panel, is not needed for the vehicle to start and run. in fact most of the sensors throughout the vehicle can die and it will still start. for the most part your dash can be lit up like a christmas tree with errors and the vehicle will still drive. oh and odb scanners are around $20
my biggest problem with any new car is the fact that they even have an infotainment system at all. i may be biased because i enjoy putting lots of aftermarket audio stuff in my car but i firmly believe they need to keep your info system seperate from your entertainment. i'm okay with having a c and gps and alerts on some dumb touch screen they feel the need to jam into the car but if i can't put an aftermarket head unit in because some stupid door alarm is tied to the radio and removing it causes problems in the car your car reeks of cheap trash.
parts for a modern car are expensive for a reason a lot of car companies sell the car at a loss and make more on the parts that why things in cars dont last long they are designed to break to make them money the worst thing in cars is the on board computer when a problem is there does not tell you have to go to a dealer with the right equipment to plug car in for a fee just to tell you what is wrong with it or if there was a problem on car you fix by your self you still need to go some were to plug it in for a fee to tell the car it has new part.
you are just presenting your impressions with no dat a-to-back them up. i would posit that modern cars are no less affordable than cars of yesteryear. part of this is because expectations are different, you talk of having multiple cars, but back in the day, families usually shared 1 or 2 cars. also, if you are in your 20's, and cant afford it, then dont buy a 40 thousand dollar car, buy a used car. also, modern cars are actually cheaper to operate and maintain, as they are significantly more reliable, last longer and have longer warranty periods.
agree with you on all the touchscreen crap. drives me nuts. i had a 2010 srt8 with heated seats and i could reach down and turn them on off without taking my eyes off the road. now in my new 2016 srt i have to use the touchscreen to control them which takes my eyes off the road for a few seconds. same with heat air-conditioning. there's a mechanical dial for the fan but that's it. everything else needs to be controlled through the touchscreen. and everything is integrated. if that head unit goes i lose the ability to control just about everything.
this is related to what scotty kilmer talked about with push button start and how it wore out on some cars. push button start is so common today and since there’s a control module that goes bad on push button start, it’s expensive to replace since it can only be done at a dealer. i know exactly what people should do, buy used or buy a car new as featureless as possible so there’s not a lot of electronics, basically the base bare bones model of anything. if it’s new luxury, people may be screwed because the high tech is in all types of luxury cars.
i was never interested in modern cars. i own a 72 datsun and i love it. does everything i want it too do and it is easy to repair, parts are cheap with life time warranties on it e.g. alternator, master slave clutch cylinder, starter surprising plus it is fun to repair or tune things on it like the carbs. recently my window would slip while rolling it up, 70 bucks got me both window regulators, replaced it myself. window goes up again. enjoy your keyless entre, my key opens my door all the time and if your keyless sensor goes out on you, good luck.
i really have no tolerance for luddites such as this guy. don't get me wrong i love my old bmw m3 no abs traction control or any of that shit 100% manual driver controlled. i also agree with him that they need to update their shit coming from someone who knows a lot about programming and cars they can update in the future. but understand this tech that your are shitting on is saving people's lives every day abs steering control shit like that saves lives. get the fuck outa here with that i want to go back to 1990 shit and keep up with the times bud.
spot on. i cannot sell my rusting subaru 2006 impeza. ballzy, fast, accurate handling, comfortable, totally utilitarian and reliable. 12 years old never a real big problem. typical b.s. exhaust upgrade, new tires ,alignments, oil changes, gas fill ups, ^nothing else. thank u subaru 2006. i've driven 9 cars used from 2014 to 2016, and none of them hold a candle to this vehicle regarding the above mentioned attributes. cvt shizer, bells and buzzer going of when close to the division lines shizer, auto breaking shizer. digital computer dashboard shizer!
this is one of the reasons i am so in love with my '07 mini cooper s. there's minimal technology, and it's much simpler than most modern cars. no blind spot monitoring, backup cameras, radar systems, etc, not to mention it's also a manual, and i love the connected feeling i have with the car which is completely lacking in most modern cars, such as my mother's 2017 subaru outback. i cannot stand how disconnected i feel from the vehicle, how the computers control it rather than myself, and how many things are packed into the shitty infotainment system.
about twenty years ago, auto executives decided that they no longer wanted the average, mechanically inclined joe to circumvent the dealership by fixing or replacing parts on his own. hell, there's no such thing as a street mechanic anymore, you need technical training to remove the engine cowling. the only reason for all of this technology is support the lucrative aftermarket. people are plain lazy, why do you need a car to park itself, find you a place to eat and stop before you hit something because you can't go two minutes without texting someone?
funny you showed the same bmw stereo i was gonna mention. mine doesn't work anymore, but it, like the built in cell phone, is obsolete. it's a 97 528i that is expensive to fix when it breaks. but all things considered, i would rather run it into the ground than buy a new car. i'm 41 with a mortgage and even with also my 06 tacoma which i am also still paying on 2 more years i too struggle at times. and i do make decent money. at least i know the tacoma will be pretty much trouble free and run forever long as i take care of it. the bmw with 240k miles?
i want to be able to blast thru a wooden fence, across the yard, and into the side of the house, and still be able to back up and drive home. but you hit the nail on the head a few times there today's vehicles are nothing more than appliances, just a fridge on wheels, and when it goes obsolete in a couple years, you throw it away and buy another one. they want everybody to conform to the norm, follow their silly rules, go into debt and become another consumer slave under the yoke of the corporate fascist banksters. obey. do not think. consume. repeat.
manufacturers know the consumer loves to eat up technology. these days, people can't go without it. some people reach for their phone the minute they wake up. some go as far as an app to make toast. yeah, toast ffs. our hunger for technology gives us these cars and we only have ourselves to blame. call me old fashioned, but i'm fine with manually locking hubs. manual shift into 4 wheel drive. manual widows rolling down. and using a key to unlock the door. if every consumer had the same desire i did, you wouldn't see all these cars built like they are.
you don't know what the word mistress means btw unless you have two families. also, the idea that apps are put there as an excuse to create safety systems is absurd. being the safest car is what motivates safety system development. there's no conspiracy. you're right about the capitalism part but only in the sense that those apps are put there because companies like yelp pay the manufacturer to include the app. i do hate touchscreens in cars though, they are completely unsafe and they go out of date as you say. controls for a c etc. should be tactile.
i am against automotive progress, i'm stingy & tired of con-men car salesmen. i have a 2002 and a 2010 as my newest cars, but both well kept both are full of electronic crap designed to give out. next if there ever is a next new car i buy will have a good old fashioned key, doors that individually lock manually, windows that roll up manually, it'll have a v8 that looks like an engine, it'll have spark plugs, no computer chips, & it'll be designed so i can do a lot of the work myself by following a good owners manual. modern cars suck.read more show less
i like how the car manufacturers put so much effort into making safer cars to drop down the fatality on the road, but in reality it does nothing. most people who buy a new ish car doesn't care about driving, they just want to get from a-to-b. when you put that person in a safer car they will just drive more recklessly because they will depend on the cars safety system s, it's an unnecessary increase of cost to develop and manufacture these systems because in the end it won't drop the fatality level. of course abs is great, but automatic braking sensors?
the use of tech is two-fold. one, you get mad and just buy a new car. two, local shops can't afford the equipment to make the repairs, so you are forced to go back to the dealer. although, to be honest, on more modern cars, the dealer isn't much more expensive than the shops. right now, mid-90's toyotas and hondas are hot items if they are in good shape. that's because the cars were insanely reliable, and were built before all of the automatic tech was put in. a camry with a 4 cylinder and manual transmission from that era could conceivably run forever.
i know too many people making 35 to 45k a year and buying a 40k car on payments. the number jumps higher when you take in account a 72 month note with interest, car insurance, taxes registration. its crazy. i started looking at money differently. i'm not going to spend over a year of the next 6 years to buy a car. we buy a car to commute to the place we work, to work for our commuting device. its ridiculous. i prefer to drive a $3000 car or take public transit. i love cars and wish i could afford a new one but i refuse to become a slave to debtors again.
while mr savage is correct on a lot of points, what most people like the ones in the comments are forgetting is that there have been quite a few instances of older cars being unreliable and expensive to repair as well, long before the rise of electronics in cars. it's the same thing as the whole people are dumber today argument no. they just get things caught more now because technology allows us to connect and communicate at near-light speeds. people were just as fucking stupid back then as they are today, why do you think they even have warning labels?
always been a ford guy trucks mostly and never leased cause i was raised not to. and in all honesty i never had a vehicle completely give up on me so never saw the need. my 08 f150 costs $28k brand new and now a comparable trim is in the $45k range. this year all i wanted was great 4x4, resale value and something easy to insure fix so i got a new willy's wrangler for $35k walkout and a 6yr btb warranty. these vehicles are basically legos and you could find parts all over the word. harley davidson of cars. people paying $60k for an f150 platinum are crazy!
i have two old trucks simply because the new vehicles are so electronically challenged by over complexity that anyone thinking of keeping one of these gremlin monster repair bottomless pits is in for some major issues. i can fix my 80's trucks and they stay fixed. i can add after market electronics like stand alone self learning fuel injection and make them as gas mileage friendly as the new trucks without needing a 25,000 dollar dealer diagnostic to fix something that goes wrong. people are really getting fucked over and they seem to like the feel of it.
the only time i was able to afford of brand new 1-ton cutaway cargo van was when i work for myself and the only reason i did this was because it wasn't that much more expensive than a three-year-old van with 100,000 miles on it so just didn't make that much of a difference for me to jump up to something brand new that i'm the only one going to drive to something that's been beat that shit by somebody else and i don't know anything about. other than that i've only bought in used cars and great deals on them period at depreciation just crushes a new vehicle
this is a more conservative view on how to look at things haha. disagree with this guy 95%. it seems as if all people are dumb and cant afford and plan their cost accordingly. what his statements are, to the core, can be applied to a lot of things, not only modern cars. the problem is just how certain people treat a lot of things. so the 5% that i agree with him about was that people were tied to an idea of work hard play hard. but the thing is, working hard will just create a brute of you. working hard but be smart, you'll pull off some incredible stuff.
problem with adding more tech means you need more hardare to run more systems. to manage all these these systems they try to centralize which means removing more controls from the user and putting them in the headunit of vehicles. it feels like eventually all the controls accessed through the hu. so eventually when it freezes or fails you wont access to basic controls which means you have to go the dealership to get fixed or replaced. this also restrict users from installing better aftermarket radios that actually get updated, for fear of loss of features.
they shut your car down in the driveway when you don't pay. my 92's just right, computer controlled fuel injected engine and that's all. won't be long before your own car gives you a speeding ticket. don't pay and guess what happens. suckers. watching anybody operate one of these new monstrositys going down the road is terrifying. time for a breakthrough new car with low tech no tech and inexpensive quality. just like modern cameras. come with ridiculous features and ridiculous price. circuits are cheaper than mechanicals yet they charge more. it's a scam.
i did this mistake too. i bought a used 2013 bmw for it's idrive system. i liked it for a few months and then the warranty ran out. i got scared of the repair bills that may come up, so i sold it and leased a certified preowned lexus. my thought was, for the next 3 years i don't have to worry about the repair costs. but when i started to use the maps on the lexus, they are out dated. i could not update them as i did on my bmw. when i talked to the dealership, they asked me for 300$ just to update it to the latest version. i felt like i was being ripped off.
i've never paid more than 800 dollars for a car in my life. they've all been 90's era cars save for my current one i am working on now which is a 2004. because they are still mostly mechanical and i can work on them. i can barely do a fucking thing with all these super technical modern cars and i will never buy one with steer by wire. i don't even like drive by wire. i prefer my shit mechanical for quite a few reasons. of course, my vehicles are used for working and also simply just to get me from a-to-b. i don't need or want a rolling entertainment center.
welcome to the modern financialized era. you are being conned. again your enemy is a sophisticated, well organized, extremely intelligent, absolutely ruthless cabal of politicians, bankers, hollywood marketing organizations and nameless elites who's end goal is your absolute and total enslavement. while you work at your shit job, eat, breed, and stare at the tv, and buy useless crap you don't need, they set the conditions for products like these to be made and sold. you'll look back on this and think it was great compared to what is coming in 10 or 20 years.
your 2006 2016 parts logic is flawed. everything is subject to inflation, including. amazingly. your salary. if you compare the average earning in 2006 vs 2016, some of those parts now represent a smaller percentage of your monthly earnings than they used to. as a proportion of average household income, these things don't really cost more. plus if you can't afford a new car, don't buy a new car. there are plenty of options for low spec, low maintenance cars out there. also. phone connectivity. bluetooth has been an open standard for some number of years now!
lol at the person who gets a car with no fucking buttons and knobs. my meme car brz has a touchscreen that you don't ever have to use and no steering wheel buttons it does have toyota's cruise control stick though lol, everything has a button or knob. it's also super popular so there will be spare parts for a long time. i got the manual so i don't have to deal with cvt bullshit. stuff like this only affects the uneducated consumer. but lets face it there is no saving them. they'll look at commercials and actually act on them without doing any sort of research
not to mention the fact that no truck companies offer anything between the super short and 'regular' option. 30 years ago, a regular bed was 6', and a longbed was 8'. now you got ford with 5.5, 6.5, and 8 for the half ton trucks {of which, you can't get an 8' bed on anything but a single cab. again, forced limitations} and an 80 inch bed and an 8' bed for their heavy duty trucks. what if i want the 6' bed again because, with a certain cab size, i find 5.5 too short {which it is, regardless} and 6.5 to make the wheelbase and just the truck in general too long?
i don't understand the 1 4 dislikes, some of use have experienced this. you take your used car to the dealership only to realize that they want thousands for repair. when you take it to your local mechanic, he tells you it's complicated to fix and that it's best you fix it at the dealership. they will even try to convince you to get read of the car just so that you can buy a new one. my experience with bmw and range rover dealership. you will go broke trying to fix this cars. i latter bought me a bucket 2002 toyota camry as my day to day drive. problem solved.
first off the narrator sounds like he's never heard of used cars. if you're going to be 'that' cheap about it, go look at a kia. you can't compare honda, hyundai & mitsubishi all asian the swedish volvo. and no 27% technology increase, stretched out over ten years, really isn't that bad. however the more important phrase of the day here is, planned obsolescence, manufacturers know that, in order to keep the msrp costs low, they have to cut corners somewhere. in other words, why put in parts that'll outlast the four to five year lifespan, of an average ownership?
some of these comments are prime examples of people with a serious case of classic american ignorance. i know its part of your culture at this point to yell get a job at anyone who complains about the economy, but the sad truth is that economy has changed. i would agree with you if the work hard get paid formula was still relevant, but so many typical middle class jobs that could land you a house and a family car 10-15 years ago can't do that anymore. people find themselves working just as hard if not harder than their parents and still living in their basement.
i bought my first car in 2004 for $300 88' mazda 323 turbo, trying to keep that thing on the road during college was quite difficult. even now when i can afford a new vehicle, it is still a kick to the jimmy with current car pricing. even compact cars are not really that cheap these days. just bought a 2017 mazda3. hopefully i can hack some linux onto it in 5 years when the infotainment is dated as shit. at least they give physical controls so you are not trying to fuck with volume or heat on a touch screen while spinning some poor dude into a barrier at 120km h.
thanks auto makers for totally screwing myself and every other person when it comes to vehicles. you should have been allowed to fail and start over and been forced to re evaluate what your making and who your selling too. maybe this time you will fail and no one will be there to bail you out this to me and realize the millions of vehicles you have produce in the last decade are unaffordable and you are forced to listen to the people and what they want and not what you want to force us to buy. make a better vehicle without all of the crap that drives up the cost.
come on. you say the truth but obviously overreacting. technology must evolve so we have flying cars or whatever in 50-100 years. regarding the bills, of course you must ask before buying if the maintenance is high. everybody loses money when owning a car, new owners lose because of depreciation and dealer’s conditions, second hand owners because of parts that wear out after 100k miles. a car is expensive, but a comfort of the world we live in. not to mention that in eu taxes and gas prices are so high, in the us is a lot cheaper to own and drive the car you like.
car always were an appliance or isn't. specially since now days you can drive on uber to pay for it. also, used market is your friend if you can't pay a new one.not to mention that cars are more expensive cause you get more than in the past. a c wasn't even standard a couple of decades ago. cars now days are literary a spaceship compared to what they were.i never seen anyone complaining about those issues. ppl without money just buy used cars or entry level cheap cars.cars in the past may seen cheaper too but with money correction it is almost the same price as now
honestly, cars today are money pits, they last one third of what they used to and cost at least twice to maintain. of course they are cheaper today than they where 20 years ago because the garage get more for the repair and the car drop in resale price. i stick to my good old vw polo from 1986 for as long as i can, preferably for the rest of my life. any blacksmith and i can make any repair on the wee dub and it is build like, well it is german over engineering. if hitler have had 30 vw polos at the battle of kursk the outcome would have been different for sure lol
learn how to manage your money and you can afford a new vehicle with an average job, basically only buy necessities and build a savings account then put a bunch of money down and keep your credit score up so you can get a low interest loan. don't live beyond your means buying the newest i phone every year and the newest trendiest $100 jeans or the tons of other useless things that millenials think they need. or if you are mechanically inclined and can repair your own vehicles buy a used car with great reliability ratings and it will be much cheaper per mile driven.
the car companies should send out updates to old systems with full touch screens there is no reason they cant be updated which is why android auto and apple car play is such a good thing for cars they are constantly updated, one solution would be for the car companies to offer a refress service on cars like this perhaps you pay $2000 and they update all the software and replace the head unit i would do that for my 2015 dodge vehicle, people are paying $1000 for phones every year now i think they might actually consider doing a tech refresh on older cars and trucks,
what really sucks is how you are forced to get a package to get some stuff. and what is usually forced on you is leather seats. i personally loathe leather seats. all i need is a decent amount of horsepower, good handling, decent cargo space. i like my heated seats, but i don't need garbage like keyless entry, leather seats, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, self parking, etc. all that junk was invented because of all the cell phone zombies that can't put thier phones down while driving. someone that has actual driving skills doesn't need that garbage.
most states have laws that tell you it's illegal to lave fog lights on unless you need them for rain, snow, fog and plus the lights are either too bright or aimed up to blind oncoming traffic. and what's worse is that those morons think they are safe because the salesman told them to drive with the fog lights on. and then people have to start playing with the 'screens' while driving to find that favourite satellite radio station or a map to aunt jane's house, when you should only be doing that before you leave home. how about all those buttons on the steering wheel?
all new car is shit. 30 years ago i have manually abs system someone know what is it today car with many system have traction control problem. best car it's from 1990 japanese. solid and long life. i se how to change technology but question for what. from 1950 to 2018 on the road many changes but one think it's the same speed restriction. i have two car crv 1.6 i-dtec 2015 and yaris mk1 1.3 japanese version that car done 230k miles nothing just oil and filters changed. just one time in dealer while in buying. love the car more like honda crv it's to much complicated.
say balls to it, buy an old simple vehicle with a good or replacement chassis. you can change the stereo to play mp3 or dab anyway. if you want to look up a restaurant then stop somewhere safe and look it up on your new newish phone. if you want to watch a movie you'd best not be driving, so fit a manual screen and a projector and do it properly with outdoor cinema and some swivel seats or camping chairs. otherwise just damn well keep your eyes on the road and drive, because none of you can really multitask, it's just quickly switching between tasks in a round robin.
you may be broke, but if you got a job in a decent field affording a car is not a problem and there is a beautiful thing called insurance. if you're a dumb ass and pay out of pocket for repairs, if you don't know how to manage your finances, you probably shouldn't buy a lot of things. also all the technology you mention is because people want these features, hell i bought my car because it had apple carplay and when i sell it i know someones going to buy it because it has apple carplay. you can suggest people don't want these features, but car sales suggest otherwise.
also, on older cars you were able to fix many of the problems yourself. these days, its so connected to computers, and so densely packed, that you can't do shit. you rely on service, which will suck the $$$ out of your bank account. i live in germany. a few years ago, big companies like mercedes, audi aso. laughed, because dacia decided to build simpler and cheaper cars and go into the german market. they were laughing their asses off stating things like nobody will buy their cars. why would anyone wanna drive a cheap dacia. it got nothing to offer., and what happened?
do the research first if your buying another car these days everything isgoing sealed for life and or special equipment, they have cars with no dipsticks no drain plugs ,pumps needed to get the oil out, auto trans either sealed for life or close, with special know how on how to drain [hidden plug up inside the level check ,setting the level you have to run the engine and have the unit in neutral then if fluid runs out and slows right down thats the level, if you dont have the engine running and the unit in neutral at the required temperature it will run short on fluid!
the technology problem is huge. it's the same problem with most of the internet of things, worse than throwaway, these systems are guaranteed security risks. on price, a little smarts goes a long way. always buy parts on ebay amazon.
this is a fantastic video and very eye opening. yes, cars are becoming ridiculously more expensive, and increasingly more packed with shiny junk that goes bad quick. the metaphor you used was perfect. they are becoming more throw-away, and it is very wasteful. what surprised me though is the frightening demonstration of the faulty touch screen and climate controls. i cant believe they are failing on a car that looks nearly new. car manufacturers seem to be going after that first big sale, and dont care about longevity at all. will refrain from buying most new cars now.
feature creep. the reason they add features is to survive the competition in the marketplace. buyers compare products on the basis of features. everyone says they wish they could buy a basic cell phone computer car but when the time comes to decide, they're offered two products at the same price and one has more impressive features, and that's the one they pick. sure, a few people buck the trend and foresee problems like in this video, but by and large products that don't get on the feature creep bandwagon lose market share and fail. we are participants in this problem.
i press the push button to start. i then engage reverse, don't look back and watch the camera. i trust the car to tell me if someone is behind due to the beeping. when the beeping stops due to a failure, someone dies as you just destroyed my judgement with my own eyes as i don't look now. i never worried about fuckwits walking behind a reversing car, or trolley boys trying to rush behind as i look every second. i don't do that now. dangerous, at least i purposely brought a car without collision avoidance, it means i kill others not me. i work in it technology is broken.
