The biggest benefit of an electric car though is how they drive. After being a petrol head for as long as I've lived, I have to say driving a Tesla for the first time was a shocking experience. I've never wanted an electric car until I drove one. The instant torque slams you back into the seat and while you're driving you have all the power you need instantly at the request of your big toe.

If you give an electric vehicle charged by the sun's energy you need zero oil pumped from the ground and the car needs no oil change, no radiator fluid, no battery acid ( by the way I think you'll find that lithium mining is far less harmful to the environment than oil drilling,oil spills, oil fracking, oil pipelines, oil refineries, oil fires etc. \nI am wondering which big oil company is paying for your silly little video here as it seem you are just a mouthpiece for their anti electric vehicle campaign.\nWay to go Sven, help keep the status quo and keep the big oil companies in power. Try to educate yourself and do some real research before you post another video.\nWe live in a fully solar powered home which produces enough excess electricity to charge two cars daily as well as push an extra 10 KWH back to the grid for our community to use.

The batteries in each have only lost between 5-10 miles of range, so probably gonna get another 200,000 out of them without issue and still have most of the range they started out with. EVs are just objectively better than gas cars period! Zero maintenance, cheaper to run, and the instant torque: no waiting for gear changes or engine revs, just push on the pedal and instant power!

They dont understand power isnt stored in the grid, its produced a little bit more than is used just to keep the system working, but producing power from renewable sources isnt constant because sometimes there is no sun or wind or the wind is too strong or the river doesnt have usual amount of water. Thats why you always have to use plants that produce power from fossil fuels or nuclear fuel because it is the only way to operate the system. Otherwise the system would collapse. The only way you could do it is if you have a lot of renewable energy sources like Norway or Iceland and produce a lot more power than is actually needed. But most of countiries dont have this oportunity. Also if you ever learned thermodynamics you know that making multiple energy conversions makes you lose a lot of energy and thats just what we do with electrical cars. We produce most of electricity from fossil fuels and then use electricty to get kinetic energy so thats more conversions than if we just burn fossil fuels to get kinetic energy directly in the cars.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Domagoj Bošnir"}

But only slightly) as with a similar weight and size ICE car.\nLithium isn't \"Mined\" as you suggest in your video. It is an evaporation process. \nMost EV drivers do everything within their power to avoid driving on gray energy. Just for people to stop from pointing this out to us. So yeah My car IS charged 100% by sustainable energy. And from all the people I know that drive EV's they do too.  But okay let us say we do drive on coal. Even then we would be cleaner than driving on oil. As to create gasoline, diesel, kerosene etc, etc. You need great amounts of energy as well. up to 6kwh per liter of fuel. \nThis flaws in your equation all add up in the summery. So what about the lifetime of the car. It has already been proven that EV's have a much longer lifetime than ICE cars as the electric motors don't run down as ICE does. The batteries can be easily replaced and even upgraded (Look at the ZOE, Tesla, and Nissan) And the battery's that come out of the cars are then used to power homes. And after that, they can be recycled by more than 99% back into batteries. (oh and the 1% that can be used for other things.) \n\nThen you start about the financials.  But you fail to take in into the equation the subsidies of the oil industry and the ICE car industry. And go on about complaining that EV's get a 7.500,- subsidy. Now, this starts to look a lot like cherry picking to me. \n\nThen you say that we would say that coal power plants are not as bad?  Now you have lost me. There is NO sane person that drives an EV that would say that! Why would we as we drive as much on green power as we can as we keep on being attacked by people like you that say we drive dirty coal powered cars?  This is treating us unrespectfully and as if we were dumb. \n\nAnd the growth of sustainable energy is wishful thinking? Did you even look at the numbers? Did you even do any research on this point? Right now the sustainable energy industry is the biggest and fastest growing industry in the world and its killing coal everywhere!  So.. again you fail to get it right. And now I start to wonder... Why are you doing this? \n\nPolitical motives are the one and only reason I can think of.  As no person with a proper independent education would say this. Oh and look at that. Dennis Prager is strongly right winged tied in politics. What a coincidence.. But hey we live in a free world with free speech. So go ahead and spread your vision.

Tesla is of course a luxury car and its manufacturing is a problem despite Elon Musk making his Gigafactory powered entirely by alternative energy solar and wind and battery. But when it comes to a car like the Nissan Leaf, unfortunately we don't know much about how Nissan is making the car, but also if we charge the battery from alternative energy sources solar wind and battery, all this problem of emissions would be less. But we do have the problem of the electric grid being dominated by power from fossil fuels so it is hard to justify getting an electric car. Even when it comes to countries who use natural gas for electricity such as the UAE can benefit a little when it comes to electric cars. UAE can benefit a lot when it comes to their lack of clouds and sunlight coming on solar panels making a lot of electricity.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "hbarudi"}

So far, coal plants are still dominant in many parts of the world, renewables share is rising but at a pace that is too slow to change the game, and nuclear plants are a turn off to many countries due to safety. What we need to realize is that green house gasses are more than just gas/diesel powered cars, its beef industry and others, and the latters are even more so than cars. Furthermore, the solution will have to be a combination of many things because demand is rising and one source of power/energy will not do all, not in the short to medium term anyway. So we should welcome all efforts in the electric side, but we should also demand efforts in having more efficient/cleaner combustion engines, and welcome those too.

In three years they have 50 mile range. Why? Does the range of a gasoline powered car decrease every year? Then look at resale value. A $35,000 EV is worth how much in 3 years with a 50 mile range? Nothing, not unless you pay $16,000 for a new battery pack, then it only sells for $5,000. This isn't my opinion, watch the EV lovers talk about it. Overall, an EV is still costing the buyer and the public a fortune with less than zero benefit. What do you do with a 50 mile range battery pack? Huge expense to recycle it without polluting the landfill. Compare that to a Golf TDI. The Golf will stay on the road for at least 250,000 miles and the EV gets scrapped at 50,000 miles.

You do know that CO2 is a trace gas and its percentage of the greenhouse gases is less than 1% , closer to .3 of 1% of all the greenhouse gases (95% is simply water vapor.)    That .3 of 1% is mostly natural sources and then humans contribute.  The effect is logarithmic, meaning for each molecule added, it takes more to get the same greenhouse effect, so it's actually diminishing.  But more importantly, who cares if we doubled it to be total of 1% of all the greenhouse gases.  Greenhouse gases are 1 of hundreds or thousands of variables such as sun activity, barometric pressure, etc etc that has an effect on temperatures.  So it seems ridiculous to me on so many levels to be an alarmist when when 1) the temperature and CO2 have gone up and down for millennia, 2) CO2 is but 1 factor and a very minor player in greenhouse gases, and 3) greenhouse gases are certainly not the only nor the major factor in climate.  Considering all that plus 4) the fact that IF we were a factor, it still might be worse to eliminate fossil fuel energy which has no serious rival, when so many depend on it for advances in human flourishing, and lastly 5) who is to say that on balance a degree or 2 of warming wouldn't be on balance a good thing for crop yields and biodiversity that might be beneficial considering in our history that the warm periods had far more human flourishing than the cold periods.

Also, electric cars strike me as pretty useless in a crisis situation e. g. how would you charge them after a power outage? Also, they lack user maintainability and their batteries need replacing every few years at great expense and requiring a lot of infrastructure.

It also fails to mention one of the most critical strikes against the electric car - that there is an alternative, which is gasoline. There is no alternative to running your refrigerator or computer. We should not squander a valuable and \"refined\" resource like electricity when there is an alternative. Also there is a fact of physics that it \"consumes energy to refine energy\" like electricity. So the electric car uses more energy per mile than a gasoline powered car since it uses a more \"refined\" energy source. I calculate that electric cars can use 2 to 10 times as much energy as a gasoline car, for instance in a frigid  environment batteries can lose half of their power.

A coal fired plant has a thermal efficiency of about 40%. car engines about 25% diesels can top 30% If you charge a Nissan Leaf of a coal fired grid, it's about equal to a good hybrid, which gets its good mileage because of regenerative braking. Just throw in one wind turbine, or photovoltaic array, and the advantage goes to the electric. Again, you're right on the batteries for now. With demand for capacity rapidly increasing to get enough lithium and cobalt in the market, there is a certain amount of mining needed to prime the pipeline. Once everyone who wants one has one, than recycling can maintain the market, with mining only having to supply the expansion of the market. so initially you're right, that won't be the case in the future. A combustion car needs continuous pumping, fracking, and burning of fuel to run. Like turbines and panels, once they're built, there is no further cost to the environment. With improvements in technology, they will last much longer, with much less maintenance than combustion vehicles. You also have to consider oil changes as well as transmission and differential servicing in the operating cost of combustion. That is equivalent to just the transmission, which is all an electric drive train is, and the inevitable battery change. The battery change isn't such a big deal, because of the recyclability of the battery, like we do with lead acid batteries now. With combustion engines, the tail pipe emission is only half the emission of a gallon of fuel.

{"cid": "Ugx0N8rs7gxYYiStIAV4AaABAg", "text": "I drive a hybrid vehicle and as soon as I can get rid of it, I'm going back to a gas powered car. Why? I'm tired of having to shell out $3,000 every few years to replace the batteries. Yes, the car definitely saves me money on gasoline but I have to keep that money so I can put it back into the car to keep it fuel efficient.\n\nI drive a Honda Civic hybrid. The IMA batteries (Integrated Motor Assist) only run for about 75,000 miles before they are at a point where they don't hold a charge. It costs about $3,000 to replace them. Then there are the tires. You need special low rolling resistance tires that cost a lot more than normal tires. A set of four new tires for my car runs be about $800. And they only come in 35,000 mile variants. I can't get the 50,000 mile or the 85,000 mile tires that I used to get on my normal model car I had before I purchased the hybrid. Then there is the normal \"car\" battery in the engine bay. It is a special sized battery that can only be purchased from Honda and it runs be just shy of $200.\n\nA friend of mine purchased a Honda Civic about three years ago and he is getting similar gas mileage that my car gets when the IMA batteries are new. And he doesn't have to worry about getting new IMA batteries, special tires or anything else. for his car. He puts in regular low octane gas, low prices tires that are rated for high mileage and he consistently gets the mileage I only get when I replace the IMA batteries in my  car.\n\n\"Why don't you get a Prius? They do a lot better!\" - I don't want to get a Prius, or any other hybrid for that matter. I don't want to get any car where the drive train relies on batteries. The batteries WILL wear out. And what do you have to do when they wear out? You have to replace them. How much will it cost to replace them in a Prius? I'm afraid to find out. The Honda Civic uses a lower voltage system than the Prius. Mainly because it is not a full hybrid. In the Prius there is no direct mechanical linkage from the engine output to the wheels. The engine drives a generator that powers the batteries which power the electric motors that are attached to the wheels. In the Honda the electric motor is part of the output shaft of the gasoline engine and it assists the gasoline engine.\n\nWith that the Prius uses a significantly higher voltage and a greater number of battery cells to power the system. If the smaller system in the Honda costs $3,000 to replace, how much will it cost in the Prius?\n\nAlso, I don't like the styling of the Prius. It is not an attractive car in my opinion and it doesn't seem to have as much space for carrying people or cargo. And the cargo area is exposed since it is a hatch back/station wagon style vehicle. My Civic can carry a surprising amount for its size. Granted that the cargo capacity is limited by the IMA batteries being behind the back seat and therefore I can't fold the rear seats down, I still have a good amount of storage. Again, the looks and capacity are my opinions. The costs associated with hybrids are there for you to look up for yourself.\n\nHonestly, why would you spend more on a car that will require you to spend more on ownership compared to a conventional vehicle?", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Olli K"}

How quickly depends upon how big a battery and which State you live in.  \n\nEven in West Virginia (a pretty-much-entirely coal-powered State) with a Tesla P100D’s monster 100KWh battery, you will break even in 17 years.  Meanwhile, in Idaho, on a Nissan LEAF, you’ll break even in 4-16 months depending upon whose numbers you use.\n\nEven then, the battery cells, after 15ish years in an EV, will then be reused for another few decades in stationary-power systems, such a office UPSes, EV charging stations, or city/neighborhood power regulation (demand smoothing, in essence) stations.  And then after that, they can be recycled.  (True, recycling of Li-ion battery cells is not currently economically viable, but it is currently possible, and once enough such batteries come available, economy of scale will kick in.)\n\nAlso, don’t let the fact that cell-phone batteries “die” in a couple years confuse you.

It is true, that initial manufacturing of an EV has a larger environmental impact, but that impact is balanced out after the first year to 3 years of ownership (depending upon what battery size you buy, please don't assume everyone is going to buy a Tesla Roadster).  It helps to be in a state/country with high percentage of renewables, but even states with coal, an EV is still better.  The good news is, renewable energy sources are coming online much faster now that the economics of them work.  Take Australia for example, do some research and see what you find for percentage of renewable energy by 2020, 2030, and 2040.  EVs also last MUCH longer than an ICE car, there are WAY fewer moving parts and battery degradation is minimal even after 400k miles.   And as far as federal tax credits for EVs... in my opinion, not the best model, but that's what we were dealt.  It's a small blip in time to get us to a better technology, and in Tesla's case, they are already in phase out of tax credits (2018).  ...how about we drop those oil and gas subsides.

It takes a lot of electricity, apparently coal fired if in the US, to refine a gallon of gas so shouldn't that CO2 and pollution also be factored in for ICE vehicles?\n\n\nAlso the \"10% more electric cars will result in 10% more dirty coal fired power plants\" is completely false and intentionally misleading. No new coal stations are being planned and built as natural gas, and in some edge cases even renewables, are more economic so there will not be 10% more coal pollution. In fact overall electricity usage is declining partly due to energy efficiency improvements so coal and even natural gas plants are being idled outside peak times hence much less CO2 from electricity generation.\n\n\nIn fact \"intentionally misleading\" seems to be the theme of this video.

If you want to see your area, you can go to the link below, click on your state and look to see what type of electric plants are in your area.

Neither this right wing video or that left wing one says you shouldn't get an electric car only that it's not a solution by itself.\n\nPeople get super offended if you take away their good feelings. Makes you realize people often do things not because it actually fixes a problem but because they are want to feel good about themselves. This is why things like illegal immigration and the federal deficit don't get sorted because no matter how you do it someone will get hurt and you'll feel bad. No one is willing to do the tough love spanking of the child but when you avoid doing it the consequences are worse down the road.\n\nA few points to other comments...\n\n1. Livestock do produce a lot of greenhouse gases but a some of that (at least in cows) is due to using the cheapest feed which is hard to digest. I'm NOT for Obama era regulation but if a law required better feed emissions would be reduced and cost would go up reducing consumption. Also methane can/has been harvested for power as it is the main component for natural gas. Using it for power means it's not straight escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n2. Plants aren't the solution to everything either. Certain crops (corn) can suck the life out of the ground. That's what you get from selectively breeding it for high yield for hundreds of years. While fertilization techniques are supposed to be pretty efficient the nitrates still runoff to the ocean killing sea life. Then the Ogallala Aquifer, which is responsible for producing a large amount of food in the US, is also depleting. Without which you get another Dustbowl.\n\n3. Wind and solar supplements are good but I haven't found a site which factors in the environmental cost of storing that power when the sun and wind aren't available (at it's source not at home which I've already read is inefficient). Is it still good, yes, but it's disingenuous omitting that data and then comparing it to technologies which are on demand around the clock. Every time you charge and discharge a battery you lose efficiency not to mention the cost of making any storage system.\n\nThere is no magic bullet, no solution will ever be perfect, but people seem only willing to hear good things about the things they believe in and never negative. If you just throw money at something it's stupid and you end up with another Solyndra or Paris Climate Agreement. Only hard work, sacrifice, and, God willing, new ideas that actually work will \"solve\" anything.\n\nRandom Thoughts: If the tech is reliable and cost competitive (no idea if it actually is yet) I'd like to see our government start to replace worn out, end of service, vehicles with electric ones. Buses, mail carriers and the like. That way you can begin to proliferate charging stations and interchangeable parts. Here is hoping the elusive fusion reactor will be perfected and we can use that for power but I'm not holding my breath.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "The Mighty Gerbil"}

For two, while doing math w average is simple, but in the US EV sales and high renewable electricity is highly correlated, a lot of EVs are sold in California and here we are 29% renewable and 15% hydro, only less than 5% coal, so you have to do the math at a slightly more granular level.

{"cid": "UgzXE9A_MT_cbd9mYs94AaABAg", "text": "It's very simplistic and short-sighted to just assume that electric cars are somehow better for the environment just because they do not utilize fossil fuels.There are hidden environmental costs on both ends of the production of such vehicles. First there is the necessity for massively increased mining of the many raw materials needed to make the batteries themselves, such as nickel, cobalt, graphite and lithium. That mining involves machinery that runs on....wait for it.....fossil fuels. Such mining will increase exponentially as the popularity of electric cars increases. As those materials are mined, they can become airborne pollutants. Much of this mining is done in China, and the Chinese aren't exactly sticklers when it comes to responsible industrial and mining practices.\n\nThen there is the eventual disposal of those batteries, which is a huge problem in itself. They are not easily recycled either.\nAccording to The Guardian: \"However, in the EU as few as 5% (pdf) of lithium-ion batteries are recycled. This has an environmental cost. Not only do the batteries carry a risk of giving off toxic gases if damaged, but core ingredients such as lithium and cobalt are finite and extraction can lead to water pollution and depletion among other environmental consequences.\"\n\nSo while it is nice to want to do things that will not harm the environment, we have to actually use our heads rather than just clinging dogmatically to sacred cows. There are so many people, including here, who are simply more concerned with demonizing oil companies, and deifying electric cars, than they are with actually coming up with workable alternatives. These people seem to forget that increased production of any item carries intrinsic environmental costs. Waste byproducts result from any manufacturing process. Even our own bodies are proof of that. Not everything is renewable. I think that we need to strive for being more efficient and responsible in limiting waste, and cleaning up as much of it as we can.

Butane vapour is often released too, partly due to incomplete combustion but mainly due to evaporative emission. This can break down to form greenhouse gases. You also get nitrous oxides, and SO2 forming from the air due to the heat in an internal combustion engine. SO2 can mix with rain to cause acid rain, damaging buildings and threatening wildlife. Nitrous oxides break down in the atmosphere in homolytic fission which can lead to the production of ozone.  While this is good in high areas if the atmosphere, here it causes respiratory irritation and photochemical smog. Production of electricity will produce some of these chemicals but there they can be monitored.

Solar is increasing and now competitive cost wise and it is now possible to charge your car at least in part from your own panels at home.\n2. It should also be taken into consideration then environmental impact of drilling transporting, refining and storing fuel. How much co2 is created by the time it gets to the gas station!? The environmental impact of tanker spill’s, oil train tank derailments, refinery explosions and drill rig explosions and resulting deaths.\n3. When electricity does come from fossil fuels it is better that the powerplants are farther away from where people live. Proximity to the pollution is a major factor for the health of a population. Electric cars/trucks will solve the number one polluting factor in cities. Making the grid cleaner is a separate issue that also has to be solved.\n4. Oil companies receive massive subsidies and tax breaks(its true look it up) and they cause pollution. So it is disingenuous to say that tax dollars are wasted on electric cars subsidies when they are at least on a path to a clean solution to our transportation needs. Furthermore it it in a countries or states economic interest to help new technologies/ industries. Some new industries with a high financial barrier to entry, need a jumpstart (temporary government aid) to be successful in the beginning. What does the citizen/government get in return? Jobs, economic growth, a new industry to tax that is located in your country. \n5. Electric motors are also much, much more efficient gas engines. As for the how polluting the battery is to make, that is something that is being worked on and will improve with time. They can also be recycled. The simplicity of the battery and electric motor will last longer than a gas car so less cars be be created in the first place.\n\nBonus benefits\n1. No engine in the front allows for a cripple zone Giving passengers a better chance of surviving a head on collision.\n2. About 1/10 as likely to catch on fire as a gas car.\n3. Electric cars are exceptionally simple in design compared to it internal combustion engine therefore much less likely to have a Unexpected large repair bills.\n4. Really fun to drive the great torque. \n5. Very low scheduled maintenance costs\n6. Less noise pollution\n7. Never having to stop at a gas station in less you’re on a trip and using a supercharger on a trip. And always will be a full tank in the morning if you plug it home. \n8. Less expensive fuel.\n\nThe negatives are upfront price, range, charging  infrastructure, Availability and vehicle variety.

{"cid": "UgyIfDUYTPb0XqwQ7wh4AaABAg", "text": "Yeah electric cars are just a pipe dream. Not only are they not green but they are completely incapable of performing the tasks require of motor vehicles. Yes if you live in an eco-friendly city with Tesla superchargers everywhere, you never commute long distances and you make 100K a year then an electric car will work for you. Anyone else though, like say 99% of people and its a complete bust. The batteries are the biggest problem. They are made out of lithium which is one of the rarest elements on Earth, so estimates predict that we will run out in a decade. Plus a battery pack will cost any where between 10-20 K and they only last up to 100,000 miles. So you have to spend 10-20 thousand dollars every 100,000 miles? Yeah the average person can totally afford that. Then theres the range, the charging times and the fact that they tend to catch fire and/or explode. \n\nNot to mention they ARE indeed coal and natural gas burners. Coal and natural gas make up about 65% of power generation in the US. About 14% comes from renewables and the bulk of that is from hydroelectric. Less than 1% is from solar. So to all of you Tesla fanboys who think we're going to power the world with sunlight and wind think again. Not only is solar not potent enough, but the land area required to build enough solar panels is crazy, literally an area the size of Spain. Also google the \"duck curve\" and you'll see another serious problem. \n\nThe solution is hydrogen. We can use it to power our cars and our cities. It can be gotten from any water source and it recycles itself by converting back to water one the fuel is used. It produces zero emissions. The biggest problem is producing the fuel which is expensive and energy intensive with current methods. Thats a huge obstacle but it can be overcome. The problems with electric cars and solar power however cannot be overcome. The problems lye deep within the inherent design.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "dsparke93"}

Yes, lithium is comparatively rare, to other elements, but it is relatively ABUNDANT in low concentrations.  I'm really not sure of your claim of an impending lithium depletion, but when demand increases and our current high-concentration sources are depleted, low-concentration sources will become economically viable, therefor preventing us from completely running out.  Saying we are about to completely run out of lithium is about as true as saying we are about to run out of oil.\n\n\nOn your first point, you claim EVs are not green, probably using this video as a source.  Bjorn Lomborg's claims are proven to be misleading, and inaccurate.  This video here picks it apart, claim by claim:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwMPFDqyfrA&feature=youtu.be .  Unlike Mr. Lomborg, the author gives his sources in full.  You also claim they are incapable of performing the same tasks as ICE cars.  Even with the relatively low range EVs (only) currently have, how are they inable to do everying ICE vehicles can?  In many cases, they vastly outperform equivalent ICE vehicles, in every aspect but range and charging/fueling.\n\n\n\" you never commute long distances and you make 100K a year then an electric car will work for you\"  The average American commute is about 45km in total.  After a few minutes of googling, I found that the average new American car costs from the low to mid 30 thousands, ~ 33,000-36,000.  The base Tesla model 3 costs 35k, and has a range of 354 km.  Tesla cars have a reputation for being some of the most expensive electric vehicles, yet your claim that only rich people can afford electric vehicles in general, is demonstrably false.  Also, who on Earth commutes 350 km a day?\n\n\nYou mention hydrogen being the answer.  There are some very significant challenges with hydrogen, as you noted, but they go even further.  Real Engineering has an excellent video on just what they are.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MzFfuNOtY\nFurthermore, if the emissions generated to power EVs makes them not green, how is vastly less-efficient hydrogen any greener?Despite these challenges, I think H shows real potential for air travel, at the very least.  It's energy density is over triple that of kerosene, and energy density is the single biggest reason why electric airliners are currently physically impossible.\n\n\nYou don't sound like some loony Climate Change Denier, but I think you're sadly misinformed.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "User Name"}
{"cid": "UgxByAbEOKOarTIvOLh4AaABAg", "text": "Another well-crafted piece of misinformation from an academic SOUNDING organisation oversimplifying a complex subject with a very biased focus. For a start, no intelligent person is going to defend ANY kind of car as green. We need to improve public transport and reduce car ownership, not helped by the well documented systematic dismantling of this network by the automotive and oil industries. There is also no mention of the MASSIVE subsidies the fossil industry receive (including generation) which dwarf EV grants. Ironically, the main point this video succeeds in highlighting is that the US needs to up its game regarding renewables. No doubt there's a video in this series along the lines of 'wind turbines take more energy to construct than they ever produce blah blah...'. The only reason coal-fired power stations and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles are viable is because of the staggering energy density of fossil fuels that neither power generators nor vehicle manufacturers had ANY to do with creating - they are a COMMON GOOD that they simply dug up and processed. Of course, Lithium mining has an environmental impact, but again it is minimal compared to the impact of extracting fossil fuels plus it seems unlikely that Lithium-Ion batteries will remain the predominant technology for much longer. The significant element is normally Cobalt not Lithium anyway. Manufacturers have got away with producing appallingly inefficient and horribly polluting ICE vehicles for years and now that situation is being challenged. I charge my car almost entirely from renewables, it needs a fraction of the maintenance of an ICE car (no toxic fluids) and the battery can be readily upcycled as storage or recycled into useful items.\nThere are a lot of uneducated people out who look to people like this guy for guidance and information.

Ultimately most if not all power grids across the developed world are already under stress, using fossil fuels and other means which greenies get triggered by, yet they cannot keep up with the constant growth and needs... adding cars and buses and trucks as well as many other things to require electricity instead of a physical liquid fuel is only going to cause such a system to collapse, ultimately that amount of energy cannot be supplied without using a fuel that triggers greenies anyway, so best option is, keep the power grid that powers hospitals, emergency services and defense/police less stressed, and use alternative fuels instead of trying to force the impossible.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Vitreon Product"}

Forest don't grow on these and neither do complex ecosystems, the most dangerous things about these extraction sites is that they use a lot of water and use a lot of chemical processes, lithium ion batteries in Teslas have proven themselves not to be short-lived because unlike the lithium ion batteries encounter in your phone they are thermally managed and are cycled a lot less often then your phone this means Tesla can  give 8 year warranties on the batteries , on average 10% of a Tesla battery capacity was lost after driving 150,000 miles the average person will have to drive 10 years to get to that, and once the battery does become useless after 300 or 400 thousand miles driven on it, it can be recycled, your statement on efficiency is completely wrong you can Harvest more thermal energy from a power plant you can from combusting fuel in a compact engine, adding step up transformation transmission, loss from AC to DC conversion, Step Down Transformer, back to DC then AC again batteries still a more efficient, induction Motor efficiency makes the most efficient diesel engines look like steam engines. I was a Tesla critic before I started looking deeper into the tech (3 phase motors, Li chemistry, production emissions, environmental impact) i learned that Tesla's aren't green but they are greener than ICE, And hydrogen fuel cell given that electrolysis is the main method of producing hydrogen is also not as clean as battery technology but can cleaner the bio-diesel and since Panasonic just reduced cobalt usage by half, EVs will continue to lower their environmental impact, cost, scarcity of infrastructure until they will outcompete ICEs in neraly every way in 40 years.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "Miguel lopez"}

We have avoided the idea of green fuels so much that we depend on ignoring solutions by pointing out the already obvious situation.

Looking to several years ahead, once electric car sales surpass ICE cars, alternative energy production will have surpassed energy produced via coal mining. This concept can also be applied to the first argument. Lithium mining in and of itself isn't necessarily \"dirty\". the mining plants essentially pump the liquid deep from earth up to the surface. the liquid is then left in pool exposed to the sun, which would then evaporate the water leaving minerals like boron and lithium behind.

How can you overlook that?\n\nOh, yes, your video mentions renewables are increasing very slowly.  I call that BS.  You surely have overlooked what is actually happening to renewables on the grid.  And you've definitely overlooked the possibilities of producing energy with solar panels on your own roof, or small wind turbines on your property, and charging your car with purely green energy.  Try doing that for a \"gasoline-car\".  Good grief.\n\nWe need to develop all the various renewable sources of energy to ensure we don't stay dependent on gasoline and therefore vulnerable to the political instability of the Mid-East.  You conveniently left-out the well-known fact that all of the OPEC countries overstate their reserves, and overstate every classification thereof.  Why do they do that?  \n\nAnswer:   How else can they ensure the West stays addicted to oil and requires every drop of Mid-East oil to be extracted and refined?  Wasn't it like 10 years ago that Saudia Arabia reported tapping into their last big oil field from which the oil is expected to be extracted at very low cost?  What do you think will happen when OPEC reports reserves so low that there's enough oil for only 5 more years of usage at current rates?  I dare say it would spur development of alternative sources of energy, and a lot of oil in the ground would end-up \"economically unfeasible to extract\".\n\nMeanwhile, the other reason for exaggerating their oil reserves is to qualify for higher levels of production quotas relative to the other OPEC countries.  Come on, who are they fooling?  The answer is they're fooling us and similar nations that they sell oil to.\n\nYou ought to be ashamed.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Neil Anderson"}

With the small amount of lithium required per car literally the effects of mining it are lesser to the effects of drilling the well for the fuel to fill the first tank of gas/petrol.\n\nBut wait, refinement... you're going to talk about the \"refining\" process of lithium being anti-green. Well let's talk about the refinement of oil first. An oil refinery requires a LOT of power to do it's job, I would know my dad was a petroleum engineer, in fact once upon a time they'd boast about the fact that they use \"more power than a small city\" and things like \"we even constructed our own (coal burning) power plant\". Now, of course, they refuse to release the information such as their power usage or where they purchase their power supplies from. Again the amount of lithium in an electric car, even a Tesla, is microscopic compared to the amount of petroleum product being passed through the system.\n\nAt the end of it all for a little more of an investment on building the car, as in larger production facilities with a more unified production line dedicated to fabricating these things, you can have a car that as long as you drive it for 100k miles is ridiculously cleaner. The fact is it only leaves the factory with slightly more of a CO2 footprint than a standard car (the leaf compared to it's ICE counterpart the Murano) the fact is driving the first tank of of gas makes the electric car \"greener\" kind of shows a clear bias towards your statistics.\n\nThe problem is you're willing to point out how \"non green\" an electric car is by factoring in the production of the car but refusing to consider the production of the fuel.

How they have dig huge massive holes in the earth and get deep in to the earth, not just a low level seriously deep, this causes loads of environmental issues. Oil isn't recyclable, meaning once it has been used it's gone, there is no getting it back. It's just gone. Lithium can be recycled to a high level. In fact a few large recycles believe they can recycle 100% of the battery meaning, that at a certain point in time, very little to no lithium will be needed from the ground. As everything is recycled. So long term no more damaged is caused. \n\nAdditionally Oil constantly needs to be  found in the earth. Causing massive amounts of sea destruction, oil spills, and also looking for oil on huge boats with high powered sound waves kills animals and destroys their environment. So it's a lot easier to get lithium without causing all this destruction. \n\nLong term it makes far more sense to focus on using renewable energy as a power source too, as very little to no maintenance is needed on renewable sustainable energy, when done right. So if humanity focuses on renewable sustainable energy as a power source, focuses on refining renewable sustainable energy power sources making them cleaner and more efficient, eventually we'll end up with a much cleaner world. As there will be next to no mining needed, a constant source of energy from the environment and, next to no gas emissions due to recycling batteries. Long term it makes more sense to go in this direction. \n\nThere is also ways like algae to help deal with CO2, and I think humanity should look in to ways to clean up the atmosphere so that we have more control over the weather.

Fact is you are quoting shit info from prior to 2010 which is as antiquated as ur narrow beliefs. \nMaybe u should visit, MIT/Bercley/Stanford to get ur \"info\" up to date.\nThe emissions from same class EV to same class-ICE (mid size to mid size, not Large car to compact as per ur ill info) was 18,000lbs for nissan Leaf and 16-17,000 lbs for a Corolla/Civic. And ur misguided 26,000lbs which refers to a Tesla Model-S is also wrong as California has one of the cleanest electrical grids in USA, never-mind the fact that Tesla has a contract with sustainable energy generator such as Edison's Solar plant.\n\nUSA as of 2017 as a country uses only 14-15% of electricity (consumption) from cole (and that number is dropping with each cole company going bankrupt) and as the grid continues to get cleaner with more and more wind generation. As of last year 11% of USA is using renewable energy and 9% from nuclear, with peroleum 37% and natural gas 29%. And do remember cole is 200% more dirty than gasoline.\nWhile \n\nEV have already been proven to have HALF the emissions over life time of vehicle even in USA by a recent MIT study.\n\nYour claims of 3-5 tons of less emissions over life time of cars for EV is total BS with no actual data to back it up. And the emission from diesel info is already BS as per Diesel gate scandal, which proved that diesels were a total lie (hence the 33Billion US dollars in fines to VW).\n\nOne of Mining Lithium ways is a process of evaporation and filtering of oil brime (better than dumping brime in the river)\nCarbon emissions during production of EVs has been reduced by 70%  and emission production of Batteries has come down along with its price by 80% since 2010, as less expensive cobalt and graphite are used (now organic synthetic graphites are used), from $1000/kwh to under $200/kwh according to GM/LG.\nAnd you Lithium argument is idiotic as only 2-5% of the battery by weight is Lithium, and theres a lot more aluminum in it than any other material.\n\nIf you trying to back up ur claims, at least back it up with actual new data, not garbage from 20th century & trying to pull a vail of crap over peoples eyes.\n\nAs is you should be awarded an honorary doctorate in bull shit.\n\nOh and Bjorn, and show us who is paying for your \"research\" or for the lies ur spewing, since last time i checked it was the oil industry & the Koch brothers.\n\nhttps://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/life-cycle-ev-emissions#.WzZbrvezxlc\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d14b6c8a-c61e-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656\nhttps://www.transportenvironment.org/press/electric-cars-emit-less-co2-over-their-lifetime-diesels-even-when-powered-dirtiest-electricity\nhttps://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=us_energy_home", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "M Oczakow"}

But first you're the only one that can change your mind, I can only give you some direction, and if you can't understand my points, well it will be all for nothing, so please don't take this as an argument between us, but a discussion.\n\nFist there is the car itself, and unfortunately most people talk about the car as the battery, but if you look at it as electric engines vs. combustion engines, you can see the ridicule position that the combustion engine is in, please look at some videos, or I can point out this more, but its so obvious, that I feel it's unnecessary.\n\nAs for the battery (technology), I don't know how much you know a hand drill, but I work continually around the house, and I found it very useful, but did you ever thought why didn't we had a battery for those 10, 20 years ago or more, the combustion engine populated a lot more then cars, look at chainsaws, a combustion run chainsaw shakes an electric one does not, but the battery for them was never pushed because they work on combustion, and to get back to the small drill, the only reason it exists its because mobile phones! pushed battery development. Its shameful, that people treat the battery so bad but we never pushed for it, although we desperately need it. As for this video, I think that they should included the pollution of extraction and refining of both coal and petroleum, it would defiantly underline a more darker picture of combustion.\n\nIn short, any technology its difficult, and you could argue that the electric car should have waited for better battery, for better solar panels, for better... technology, and I agree ... a lot, but the truth is that our economy and technology go hand in had, and you need a demand for any technological progress, and since there is demand for batteries, electric motors, and solar panes, those will be resourced and improved, and together with a better electric car comes better batteries for bikes, chainsaw, hospital backup power, and together with better solar panels, better housing all over not needing power lines.

Btw, the rich car industry hates disruption and you will find A LOT of misinformation against electric cars. Including this video. \n\n1. The battery is 1/3 of the price of the el-car. The battery costs has dropped steadily for many years. Around 2023 el-cars will become cheaper than fossil cars to buy and they will continue to become even cheaper to buy. The overall price reduction comes because the el-car have fewer moving parts and are less complex. \n2. Charging is cheaper than fueling.\n3. A fossil engine has approx. 1500 moving parts. An el-engine has 2-3. Guess which needs more maintenance. Also, the battery's have proven to last much longer than expected. In most cases they last the cars  life. (Remember that your cell-phone battery is built to break and your car battery is built to last. It just about different business models.)\n4. El-cars are less likely to roll over and have other safety advantages. NHTSA awarded Tesla S the highest safety rating of any car ever tested. \n5. El-engines+battery takes less space, thus more space for luggage. \n6. Instant power to the wheels. Telsa S outperformes many much more expensive super cars on acceleration. Generally el-cars have better acceleration. \n7. Instant electric power to the wheels also benefits car handling. Especially on icy roads. \n8. Less noise and no Nox gases in the cities.\n9. Oil is valuable and won't last forever. There are better uses of it than burning it.(Making plastics and other valuable materials.) \n10. If you don't use  the car much it can be used as a battery that buys and sells electricity. Thus earning you money. \n11. No air vents -> Possible to make less air drag. The Tesla semi has a lower drag coefficient than a Bugatti Chiron. \n12. A el-car doesn't have a gear  box--> Less maintenance, less complexity. \n13. A battery has smaller energy density, but the energy transformation is much more efficient. Comparing only the energy density makes no sense. \n \nRange:  \nGenerally, the car lasts longer than you do. When you have driven for many hours and want a break, you charge the car at the same  time. For regular commuting to work, etc, it's enough to charge at home during the night. Norway has most cars pr person and this is  the common answer el-car owners give me. According to them (who are regular family people, not el-fanatics), the range isn't really a big problem. Also, becasue of 1. the range will continue to expand in the future.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Jonas Jam"}

It might become viable, but it's not yet, and there's a chance it will never be.\n90 thousand miles is approximately the life of an EV battery. The heavier the car, the bigger the batter and the faster the kilowatt-hours evaporate. If a gas car can keep going past 90k (any well maintained one is statistically likely to make it closer to 200k without an engine or transmission rebuild), and an EV needs its most expensive component (from a pollution standpoint) replaced, then the gas car might even outperform an electric car.\nIf you're going to say someone has their facts and statistics wrong, you'd better back up your substitutions with some citations. Why should we trust yours?\nThe issue with cars isn't so much that they burn fossil fuel, it's more that on average you have 2 tons of car moving 200 lbs of passenger and cargo (a person and their laptop and lunch for work).

No matter how the electricity is generated, in order for an electric car to drive the energy it needs has been converted so many times with efficiency losses, there is so much more energy needed to produce the power, than the car actually uses. in most cases coal gets fired, turned into heat, turned into steam thermal energy, turned into mechanical energy, turned into electrical energy, turned into chemical energy stored into batteries, turned into electrical energy bythe batteries, then turned finally into mechanical energy by the motor. Each of these processes have countless energy losses causing the car to use like 3x more energy to move than if you just use gasoline. I'm sure the numbers are off and gas cars are even WAY more efficient than i actually think. Burning fuel requires just 1 process of converting chemical energy into mechanical energy wich has a pretty good efficiency and you'd require less fuel to directly power a car than to generate electricity with it. Hell, it's even more efficient to drive on pure wood burning than electricity. It's madness really. So no, pure electric cars are NOT the way to go. Hybrid cars are a very good step in terms of fuel efficiency, but we really need to focus on green energy production FIRST before we power our cars by polluting energy. I think the best way would be with alternative fuels and hybrid systems.\nOnly in a  world were electricity is extremely cheap and abundant, like if we would all be living of fusion power, electric cars would make more sense", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Berton"}

Coal gets a bad rap, but we have huge reserves, and I know very smart people are looking at ways to use it in a more environmentally friendly fashion.  One example, in the past, it was strip mined, and left the surface of the earth in major disarray.  Now, companies are forced to put the land back as they found it.  Many said that this would drive coal companies out of existence which hasn't turned out to be true.  In a similar fashion, coat fired generators are much cleaner than they were decades ago.  Who knows, we may find ways to use coal in green fashion that is cost effective at some future point.\nI drive a Chevy Volt, and find it to be the best of both worlds.

While Australia closes coal plants and France exchanges nuclear power plants for wind, we must begin to produce our own combustion engines because Brazil will in the near future be the only one to finance terrorism. How much do you pollute a glass industry or a steel mill compared to all the cars on the street? The coal releases CO2 and sulfur that can be captured in tons filters, can we by the same filters in a car?

The electric car reduces the causes of diseases in the air of cities, renewable energy without constant and direct pollution and recycling, not only to reduce natural exploitation, but to cheapen the products. For example, recycled glass consumes approximately 40% and aluminum consumes only 15% of coal compared to refining the ore.

Notice the complete lack of a hole in the ground, or large scale mining equipment.  Of all the thing to criticize, lithium mining is one of the most benign forms of mineral extraction on the planet.  Copper, iron, nickle, aluminum, and especially cobalt, are far worse, and used in far greater quantities in ICE and EV vehicles.\n\nMyth number 2, EV cars emit comparable amounts of CO2:\n\nAll of these estimates on CO2 emissions from both EVs and ICEs conveniently miss 1 really important point.  Gasoline does not spring up from the ground.  It's extracted as either crude, or bitumen, which must be refined, which requires large amounts of energy.  You know why there are so many coal power plants in the US?  Because the vast majority are powering oil refineries...  You include the fuel required to refine gasoline in your comparison and you'd find there was no comparison.  In fact if every car in the US magically became an EV tomorrow, the demand on the electric grid would be near identical, since the amount of energy it takes to refine 1 gallon of gasoline can drive an EV about the same distance an ICE can drive on that gallon.  Its funny how no one mentions this...\n\nMyth number 3, subsidies:\n\nWhile I'm not a fan of subsidies for anything, oil and gas are the most subsidized commodities in the US.  If gasoline were not subsidized, gasoline would cost nearly 12$ a gallon.  And that doesn't even start to consider the amount spent waging wars in other parts of the world to secure cheap gas reserves.  So sure, remove all subsidies... ALL of them, then run your numbers again.\n\nMyth number 4, coal pollutes more:\n\nActually this is true.  You can make environmentally safer coal plants, but that costs money and profits > all.  So the oil and gas conglomerates, the ones that refine all that 'safer' gasoline, lobbied to ensure that coal plants don't need to use proper scrubbers.  With EVs, we can get rid of both, both the gasoline emissions in the city, and the coal emissions outside it.\n\nMyth number 5, renewables cannot power the grid/fossil fuels are here to stay:\n\nThis numbers are completely fabricated.  The electric companies are terrified of renewables, and are lobbying every level of government because they know that it can easily power the entire grid, and completely undermine their monopoly.  You don't even have to believe the proponents of renewables (ie. the environmentalists), look at the opponents and what they are doing.\n\nSo much BS in this presentation...", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "CrimsonTide001"}

It's a weak point in the video, and they should have included it for a true apples to apples comparison, since gasoline doesn't magically appear in the car's gas tank, just as electricity doesn't magically appear in the other car's many batteries.  Good point, and I'm edified to know it, so thank you.  I do not know how many pounds of CO2 that will add to the gas car's carbon footprint, so at least in this context it's something we're unable to evaluate (unless we could find a source for it that measures it in the same units as the video does, thousands of pounds of CO2 over the life of the vehicle is, I think, the unit they're using).  Absent that, which could be a small number or a large one for all we know, comparatively speaking, we're left with the other facts in evidence, namely the cost.  If we're talking about an all-nuclear-generated electricity grid with its cheap and plentiful power, then I'll buy an EV tomorrow.  However, we're mostly a coal-powered grid in this country.  So the expense and the carbon footprint (so far as we know) still argues for the gas car, IMO.  But good debate!  It's good when logic prevails over ad hominem attacks -- would that there could be more of that in today's political discourse.  We may not agree, but I do appreciate how you handled yourself.

The oil is then refined to make petrol and diesel. This is then sent to gas stations via shipping container, train, pipe and eventually lorry. This process of extraction to pump adds a lot of CO2 before you even fill up. \n2) ICE (internal combustion engine) cars then produce emissions for the entire time they are used. \n3) Cars get worse over time and pollute more. This is due to parts wearing out or breaking over time. \n4) Solar energy has the shortest journey from sunlight to solar cell to battery. It’s literally the entire journey and it produces no CO2. \n5) electric vehicles produce zero emissions. \n6) technology when it becomes mainstream influences large changes especially when its revolutionary or cheap. Example, in 2006 no one had traditional smart phones because the first iPhone was made in 2007. In 1980, most people didn’t have personal computers. \n7) Oil will run out in 50 years time. We therefore currently have no workable replacement for oil except electric vehicles. Hydrogen is not a good replacement because it requires more energy to make it, its explosive and it requires a giant infrastructure. \n\nThere is a reason every car manufacturer has started making EV’s.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "R X"}

The logical turning point will be reached when an American built truck like the TeslaSemi is more efficient than his current competitors, when it comes to mileage costs, due to less wear and tear. Please open your mind and re-think why nowadays railway companies do not use coal-powered steam locomotives anymore, even though the last ones built might have been the best of its kind? And why is it state of the art that even Diesel-powered trains have generators attached to the motor, instead of tremendous gearboxes? \n\nIs it an American value, to be so dismissively conservative?  For how long time have combustion engines substituted horse power? And isn’t it a little bit naive to take it for granted that the combustion engine should remain unchanged for further decades, is it? \n\nBy the way, UPS, ordered already a high number of the Tesla Semi, probably not because they are so good looking.

So electric cars are actually far worse for the environment and our quality of life than fuel driven cars.  Elon Musk knows this all too well, he has a major stake in the battery recycling business.  Yet he doesn't tell the truth about the horrible pollution his cars create.  He's too busy making tons of money selling Teslas to hippies.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "chemicalsweet13"}

Tesla is going to build battery factories and energy grids with zero use of fossil fuels. So the carbon emissions for the production of their cars will reduce dramatically. And their innovations will change the energy market. As for the slow growth of solar in the US - this is due to the fossil fuel industry actively working to stop the spread of renewable energy. There is a long history of the big fossil fuel and car manufacturing companies working together to keep the combustion engine the main engine for cars and trucks. Over the years they have bought up the patents for more energy efficient engines and technology - to stop those engines from reaching the market.\n\nThe Obama government invested in a thin film solar company Solyndra - and lobbyist and fossil fuel companies use this failure as an argument why solar is not the answer. But competition from the outside the US - mainly from China - is now making solar energy more affordable and cheaper than coal power.\n\nCombine distributed solar energy production with industrial solar energy - we can certainly move to a future where solar and renewable energy can totally replace fossil fuels.\n\nBut there is one thing which is preventing this - government policy and laws - and these are being strongly influenced by the fossil fuel industry. And I suspect this video was sponsored by fossil fuel interests.\n\nJust using the argument that battery production produces lots of carbon emissions, doesn't address future innovations. So I agree 100% with you - if we keep energy production mainly with coal powered electric - then it doesn't make sense. But if we use our democratic rights and push the government to switch to renewables faster - then switching to electric cars makes total sense.\n\nTesla is the most innovative company in this space. Their gigafactory is designed to be zero carbon emissions. They are also building a new energy grid to allow storage of solar and wind energy captured from a distributed energy system (solar panels on roof tops - wind farms - massive solar arrays).\n\nBut it is not only Tesla that is helping change the energy market. We have India, where they built the largest solar array in the world in 2016. And China is also investing heavily in industrial solar production. And there are some rays of light for the US too. The Nevada, Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project is an innovative power plant that uses Molten Salt and CSP (concentrating solar power).\n\nSo your analysis is accurate for the US only. Many other countries are making huge shifts away from fossil fuels. If the US were smart - it would vote in better politicians and not a group of climate change deniers (that are in bed with the fossil fuel industry).\n\nSo your analysis is the worst case view - but the reality can be more optimistic and a better outcome than what you predict for the future..", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Stephen Cotton"}

Even at charging stations it takes 1 hour 15 minutes just to reach 100% capacity. it takes 20 minutes to charge the battery to 50%. At a conventional gas station with ICE cars it only takes a couple of minutes to fill up the gas tank or less depending on how much gasoline you buy.\n\nTesla Motors has to invest in cafe's and restaurants now because it takes so dang long to charge the battery. Charging the battery overnight with a 220v charger takes up to 12 hours! to fully charge the battery and you only get a measly 300 miles per charge in optimum conditions. While conventional cars can easily get 350 to 500 miles when you're driving long distances or on the freeway. If everyone started using electric Tesla cars it would put so much strain on the energy grid that it would collapse. Charging stations would be overcrowded because you have to wait at least 20 minutes for other people to charge their vehicle, (I might as well go inside and buy a overpriced coffee while I wait to recharge my battery).\n\nElectric cars are a pipe dream and they're funded by your tax dollars whether you like it or not.

Problem is, there is still about $100 trillion of oil in the ground that companies want to make profits on.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "MarzNet256"}

You need plenty of coolent, water, and machinery to make a nuclear reactor work. Its those last two especially that make this a dubious proposition.

Both of these things take up space and mass, which are things you don't have a lot of in cars. Then there's the waste products. A uranium reactor produces a lot of toxic radioactive waste that is difficult to deal with, and a thorium reactor, while producing less toxic waste, does produce short bursts of gamma rays, which are deadly and difficult to shield against. And the common man won't know how to properly deal with nuclear waste, which will inevitably lead to environmental damage. And there's the problem of fuel. Directly powered uranium cars will need very expensive fuel which is difficult to produce and ship. Directly powered thorium cars have a more abundant fuel source, but they are still limited by other factors.

By the way, literally all manufacturing is going to produce pollution, some have even thought of taxing cow farts.\n\nTaxation = control, so at this point, we need to know when to tear it all down and replace it with a single flat tax, this will drastically reduce unemployment by driving the lower classes into jobs and force costs of literally all goods for the average consumer down by reducing the corporate tax to that of a consumer,  giving the government more revenue regardless of how much we think it won't.\n\nAlso, let's eliminate the welfare state, because it makes people MORE dependent on the government and drives up unemployment for citizens while pulling in many people who don't have citizenship status, as well as reducing money we have for public works and actual publicly owned things. Let's also cut back on subsidies, such as the ethanol push that only takes up farmland with oxidative-stressed GMO corn, raises taxes, and waters down gasoline.\n\nIt's all risk vs reward, by a simple equation: reward / risk = usage wt.

The same is happening with oil companies and oil-funded tycoons.\nPrager-U is a non-profit university, which gets most of their money from donors, like oil companies or the Koch Brothers.\nThe media shits on Tesla every time a little tiny bad thing happens, and why?\nThey are either A. Oil funded or B. Tesla doesn't advertise, so they don't get any money from them.\nExample: There are thousands of car fires and plenty of crashes every year, do they tell you that Ford cars are unsafe when 13 of them caught on fire last month and 32 of them crashed? No!\nBut when a single Tesla catches fire or crashes in the whole month, every news outlet is talking about it for x days and tell you that the Autopilot is not a safe self-driving feature, even though it is safer than just driving and it is only a driver assistance system and the driver is supposed to keep his eyes on the road and it's intended to be best used only on a non-disrupted stretch of highway, but people are dumb and errors can happen, like weird-behaving traffic, hilly terrain and the driver not paying attention or climbing into the back seats, so then accidents happen.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Evolt"}

It's a cost comparison of the electricity required to charge the car vs the price of fuel to power a gas car to travel the same distance.  The problem is,  if electric cars were truly more efficient,  you could charge them with a generator with less fuel to go (let's say) 100mi vs a gas car.  I vaguely remember someone doing this.  And the generator burned 5gal to power a Tesla 100mi (give or take). That's 20mpg in a vehicle with regenerative braking.  That's 4mpg than my 2001 V8 F150 4x4 i bought for $4,000. That's the worst mileage of any sedan since the 1970s. My 1978 Granada got 22mpg freeway or better. \nSo, to make sense of this,  ill explain: the electric companies (in the US) still run mostly on coal.  Coal is dirt cheap.  So,  realistically, a Tesla produces 20-30mpg in carbon while it's sold to you at the price of 100mpg. ie $3.00 for 100mi of electricity.  Still as much carbon (or considerably more)  than a comparable sedan when you factor in a 1/3 loss in electricity in transmission (from the power plant to your house) and at least 10% loss in charging.

Far more dangerous than gasoline or coal fires! Conclusion: Murica loves coal so buy a V8. Seriously??

Internal combustion engines in large use very abundant and easily processed materials also, the huge amounts of lithium and other rare earth materials needed to try and build an abundance of electric and even hydro-cell cars, is completely negated by the use of existing tech, tweaked to be more clean/efficient rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. \n\nbattery powered cars will always have limited range, short life spans and be ultimately a complete waste of resources, its essentially a gimmick, meanwhile there are obvious answers staring us in the face that dont require the redundancy of billions of vehicles worldwide. it really is common sense that electric will not be the actual future.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Vitreon Product"}

Contamination sites arent as rare as people want to believe and they arent going to be decontaminated in any foreseeable time-frame. leaks of contaminants from nuclear reactors and waste facilities as well as transports can have long term effects, as seen in a lot of east block/eurasian countries, and the people can be generationally affected in their millions without anyone warning/knowing. Often governments world wide will sweep the disaster under the mat and pretend it never happened till they are exposed. the mining, refinement, use and storage of nuclear material has an exponential increase on the amount of radioactive material and waste that is present in the environment, it is not as simple as uranium going in hot and coming out cold, one of the greatest examples of this at present is the situation still worsening in Japan... another more historic and not really spoken of examples in in russia where waste that was dumped into Lake Karachay thought to be contained was then spread over millions of hectares of land affecting millions of people. \n\nall in all the pipe dream that nuclear was going to end pollution and give everyone a cheap reliable and safe alternative has been more than shot down, and with a great number of nuclear facilities hosting exponentially larger (per year) volumes of waste materials from the fuel itself to water and components that are all radioactive and unsafe, and these same plants all ageing quite badly, there really isnt a good argument for it.\n\nPerhaps like mentioned before, If the scientific community can come up with a working cold fusion tech and a way to properly manage nuclear waste other than just burying it and dumping it, then sure, but until then, its a no from me and many others.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Vitreon Product"}

That horrible pollutant CO2 is not only mentioned at the beginning of the video with animated graphics (0:12-0:23ish,) but if we had no CO2 in the air, we would all die quickly.  (Remember how all plants that produce oxygen \"inhale\" CO2?)  And then nobody would have any plants to eat, either, not even the carnivores.  Not only that, but do you realize that more CO2 would help green the earth?  Check out Sherwood Idso's work on doubling or tripling the amount of CO2, and how the resultant growth is extremely robust, up to twice the resulting biomass.  The tulip growers in Holland know this, and even take advantage of it; that's why they grow their product in CO2-rich, blazingly bright greenhouses that you can see form the air on approach.  Because if they didn't, the plants couldn't be all grown up and ready to be cut and shipped around the world in time for the First Day of Spring.\n\nAnd if we let the CO2 levels drop under 150ppm, plants will effectively stop photosynthesis.\n\nAt which point we would die.\n\nBTW, in what ways is CO2 harmful to humans and the environment?

The unused amout of energy produced by the coal station can either be stored in large batteries (unlikely, there are no such big batteries yet) or be sold to other communities nearby for money. The Coal plant will burn the coal, weather you had an electric car or not. You are just benefitting from the unused coal burned that would otherise be exported anyway, because the plant DOES NOT count the ammount of Electric cars that are being used. This might however change if a seriously Huge portion of electric cars were indeed used. Anyway this is a point to also look into the Coal Plants, and find other ways of harnessing Energy.

These battery replacement can range from $5,000-$20,000 depending on the vehicle. Meanwhile a well taken care of combustion engine is capable of up to 1,000,000 miles with minor repairs. (That's not a joke there are cars out there with a million miles on the original engine.) Meanwhile, in an electric car every 7-10 years (70k-100k) miles, you have to spend thousands of dollars to replace the batteries and eventually, that repair cost will be higher than the value of the car. What I'm getting at here is that in 15-20 years an average electric car will have totaled itself regardless of how well you maintain it.

The estimated life of a lithium car battery is well over 300K miles, or about 23 years of service until they need recycled. When properly cared for, research estimates indicate that lithium ion car batteries can go well over 350K miles before they drop below 80% capacity.\n3. America could be 80% independent from middle eastern oil dependance by 2030 if America would put more effort into renewable energy- similar to what China is CURRENTLY doing. America, second or thirty seventh best in so many ways.\n4. In order for an gas burning car to be equal in carbon foot print etc, it would need to get about 70 mpg-any out there that can do that yet?\n5, Yes, some electricity is produced via burning coal-see point number 3 above and 7 below.\n6. The sun shines more energy on the planet in one hour than we use in one year- we have free nuclear fission power in the sky.\n7. It's estimated that a mere 44 miles square of solar panels would fulfill ALL of Americas electricity needs.\n8. Any one know how much air, water, and soil pollution is produced by big oil in America every year? Estimates indicate that fracking poisons about 260 billion gallons of water a year-and this study was done some years ago. The chemicals in fracking do not biodegrade, and do not filter out in the soil-it will be in our DRINKING water forever-seen the wealthy having discussion summits on water futures yet?

{"cid": "UgiIIdXyFZ_zH3gCoAEC", "text": "Several flaws in this analysis:\n\n1)  To say that 1/3 of an electric car's emission comes from it's production is not possible to quantify.  It depends on how long the car lasts, and how far it its driven.  If a car only drives 1 mile and is wrecked, then almost 100% of THAT car's emissions came from it's production.  A similar study done 10 years ago (since debunked) claimed that a Hummer was cleaner than a Prius based on it's lower production emissions.  However, that study assumed that a Prius only lasted 100,000 miles, so you would have to buy another one.  It also assumed that the Hummer would last 250,000 miles.  both assumptions were ridiculous.  It also included the emissions of the construction of the actual Toyota assembly plants into the emissions of the Prius production.  The Hummer used an old assembly plant.\n\n2)  When factoring the Carbon footprint of the electric car, you used the Leaf as an example.  I suspect that the Leaf doesn't have as clean an assembly plant as the Prius, which has a modern assembly plant with 50,000 sq. meters (538,200 S.F.) of solar panels, and generates 2,000,000 watts per hour.  That somehow doesn't seem to have been factored in to your equations.\n\n3)  In the USA, only 30% of electricity is generated by coal.  34% is from natural gas, and 20% from nuclear.  The rest is hydro/renewable.  So to claim that an electric car is a \"coal driven\" car is mostly false.  Especially since natural gas is much cleaner than gasoline, and Nuclear has nearly zero emission.\n\n4) Like hybrids, electric cars use regenerative braking to recover energy from it's lost inertia.  conventional cars don't.\n\n5) The Mercedes CDI burns diesel, which you use to discuss it's CO2 emissions.  But it is well documented that diesel (even \"clean burn\" diesel), while being better for CO2, is much dirtier than gasoline (petrol).  You conveniently switched from \"pollution\" to \"CO2\" whenever the one emission favored your argument.  In fact, the Mercedes Diesels aren't even for sale int the USA any more due to emissions problems.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Robinson"}

Moreover, the power source for your electric car can be solar or wind, not mentioning Hydrogen fuel cells; since electricity is not difficult to produce as people that know, should be telling. 3) The cost to owners:  as any cost in this society it is due to inflation on the part of companies trying to squish as much as they can before one's bail out.   Let's have a brief comparison.    This is my personal case:  Cost of electricity per month = 80 to 170 + or - $1500. Yr.

CO2 is also odorless, colorless and not poisonous to humans below 10,000 PPM, a concentration we will not ever get near. The effects of CO2 on climate have been severely overhyped by clowns like Al Gore, and by actual measurements, turned out to be mild at best. The temperature has risen by what? a bit over 1 degree C over the last 40 years, and given the natural variability of the climate it is highly uncertain how much that is caused by CO2. It is a non-issue anyway because within another 40 years fossil fuels will run out and any excess CO2 will be absorbed by nature, causing a greener planet.

The two largest of these drawbacks are limited viable locations and the ecological impact on the local wildlife. We only have so many rivers that are suitable for hydro plants, and that limits where they can be placed. For example, in the Eastern US, where we might benefit most from hydroelectric power, the land around any possibly viable rivers is already held or occupied by others, so would we need to take someone else's land in order to build? Also, considering the physics of hydro, you need a couple of things for a viable hydroelectric plant. the first is naturally water, but the second is distance. In order for hydro to work, you need to have water flowing with enough volume and speed to generate sufficient force to turn huge generator turbines to create the electricity. This means either finding a natural change in elevation of the river (such as a waterfall), or creating one (building a dam). Just looking at the dam option, in order to raise the level of a given river enough to make a viable hydro plant, you will end up  \"backing up\" all of the water that the dam holds back, and often for MILES. Even a tiny power plant for generating electricity would need several FEET (and often YARDS) of additional elevation in order to generate the flow required to generate a useful quantity of electricity. Many hydroelectric power plants in the Pacific Northwest (where I come from) have raised rivers by TENS of feet, backing up the water they contain for MILES. This represents a HUGE, often catastrophic, impact on the local eco structure. now, granted, that area slowly \"recovers\" over time, but the interim cost is very high in terms of wildlife, plants, and even fish. I've kind of rambled a bit here, and have mixed my two points together a bit, but they go hand-in-hand, and I think I've more or less made my point. Hydroelectric power has its place, but it isn't as \"green\", or as viable, as you might think.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Dave Morton"}

I've talked to installers that say they install Chinese PV because it's cheaper.  China heavily subsidizes their industry even more so than the US.  So, part of it is foreign competition.\n\nSo, some of the subsidies are aimed at keeping the US competitive, some are an artifact of previous policy, and some are designed to help with upfront costs.

Not only do you need burn coal to make electricity from coal you need gasoline to transport coal to the power plant.\n\nThat's the shit of it and why climate deniers are on the wrong side of history.  Even if Climate Change is a giant fraud, the energy transition is going to happen regardless.  Schwarzenegger was spot on about that.  It's not about Climate Change anymore.  The alternatives are cheaper or becoming cheaper. Grasping at coal is like a horse and buggy manufacturer saying cars will never be a thing or doubling down on beepers because they think cell phones will never catch on.\n\nTrump's insistence on reviving the fossil fuel industry will ultimately cede Green jobs to China.  In the last year, China mothballed plans for 13 coal-fired power plants and aggressively moved toward installing electric vehicle charging stations--increasing the number by 65% over the previous year. While the US currently has about 10,000 charging stations, China has more than 81,000, a figure that is six months old.  So, China is on track to have ten times the number of charging stations, and a capacity to accommodate 5 million electric cars.\n\nChina knows the direction this technological boom is going, and unlike the US, they want to be on the leading edge of it.  The US is hopelessly clinging to the past.  It's one of the main reasons we're no longer great anymore.  We're so busy clinging to the past that we're not looking to the future.  Going back to the 1950's won't make us great again.  That ship sailed.  All of you people deriding \"Green\" just don't seem to get that \"going Green\" is big business now.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "ecostarr"}

The cost to install solar panels in a region that receives high annual sunlight like Arizona is certainly cheaper than nuclear energy, But in the real world you have to store the energy in either batteries or dams, both of which are expesive, impractical on a large scale and are inefficient (meaning you loose some of the energy). Then, you need to get even more solar panels to account for cloudy days and unpredictable weather which means you would easily need 10 times more solar panels to meet peak demand on a cloudy day. \n\nSo something that was about half the price of nuclear per kwh is now at least 20x more.

A lump of depleted Uranium the size of a football can be sealed and buried, if the military does not need it for alloying into armor piercing ammunition and new generations of Tank armor. What about that waste leaking out? NEWSFLASH: The radiation coming out of the ground from Uranium deposits already exists in our environment. Using it it nuclear reactors actually removes some of it from the environment. Can Depleted uranium be stolen to make a Nuclear bomb? Not really, the point of Uranium being depleted means that the radioactive mass in it is so small, that it can no longer reach a critical reaction. It in theory can be used for a dirty bomb, but then, most of the damage from such a bomb comes not from radiation, but from the Uranium dust being a Super Heavy metal.\n\nThis is all true of old fashioned Fission reactors running off of Uranium.

{"cid": "UgjjlM-Fd35uqHgCoAEC.8KChhSFX2hT8Qm3hsnM6LY", "text": "Here's the problem with the \"Oil is cheapest\" argument.\n\n1) We have in the last 50 years expended a great deal of money keeping oil cheap.  The economic costs have three components.\n\nWe heavily subsidize oil and gas, considerably more than we subsidize alternatives, to the tune of 8 to 9 billion dollars.  These subsidies exist even though the oil and gas industry is a mature industry that definitely doesn't need subsidies.\n\nSecondly,  we allow American companies to lease federal lands and extract their resources for a fraction of the actual cost of those resources.\n\nLastly, part of the reason we have such a large military is to retain access to these resources in foreign countries.  Do you honestly believe we would expend so much money and lives on conflicts in the Middle East if they didn't have so much oil?  No, of course, you don't, you're not that stupid.  You know we don't need a military greater than all of our enemies and allies combined unless it was to defend our economic interests abroad.  We care about Iraq, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Libya, Qatar and Kuwait because they have oil. Otherwise, we would Ignore them,  just like we did in Rwanda's and the Sudan's civil wars.\n\n2) We don't account for the environmental costs of Climate Change, which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.  This is not just the costs associated with Climate Change either.  It includes the costs of human health as a result of NOX and SOX; harm from lost productivity, heart attacks, asthma and the health effects from mercury, all compounds that come from fossil fuels.  This video lies about those comparative costs repeatedly, exaggerating how much we rely on coal for electricity and ignoring the pollution that comes from tailpipe emissions.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Evan Fehsenfeld"}
{"cid": "UgjjlM-Fd35uqHgCoAEC.8KChhSFX2hT8QzhGmxgNxv", "text": "Evan, no one is going to disagree that fossil fuels are bad and must go, but we NEED them right now. lets consider the alternatives: \n\n1.Wind, this only works if you are in an area with constant wind, it is expensive and will always be expensive because it costs a lot of money to build a giant windmill. Then once you build the windmill you have to send the power to places that don't have wind, which wastes lots of energy.\n\n2. Hydroelectric, this one is great, so great that everyone already did it.  Just about every place in America that is economically feasible to build a dam has one. You could build more, but you would have diminishing returns. Dams wont get cheaper either, you still will need a ton of concrete no matter what.\n\n3. Solar, everyone loves solar these days, and its true that it's price has dropped considerably. Photo-voltaic panels have become more cost effective than concentrated solar and their efficiency has greatly improved. However you get the highest returns on your investment in one section of the country (arizona, nevada, etc.) everywhere else has limited sunlight reducing the efficiency, and there is nothing we can do about it (same problem as wind). Additionally the sun only shines during the day so we have to store the energy in either batteries (which are very expensive, bad for the environment and would require us to completely change our power grid) or by pumping water against it's flow to get power from later (which is very inefficient and expensive)\n\n4. Nuclear, which is awesome and I personally think is the way to go. However people are afraid of it and protest nuclear plant being built near them. Waste storage is a huge problem because of the same people opposing waste storage facilities. Also nuclear plants cost a lot of money up front but are inexpensive to run which requires major investment. It is ultimately the same price as fossil fuels but it's easier for companies to build a cheap coal plant and then pay more for the coal than an expensive nuclear plant and pay almost nothing for uranium.\n\n5. Fossil fuels, Extremely cheap, work anywhere in the US, Work at night, can be big or small (nuclear can only be big), widely used/not many legal hurdles or engineering challenges involved. They may kill us all, but it wont be for 100 years.\n\nIts easy to see which one people will chose. If you want to get rid of fossil fuels right now, you have to switch to nuclear, its the only option and it would take at least a decade. In the long run solar will be an option but at least in the next 20-30 years solar is not able to make up the majority of our energy production.

Cheaper than even natural gas, and much cheaper than coal.  \n\n1) Fossil fuels are not extremely cheap either.  The LCOE of natural gas is currently cheaper than everything save wind, so you're on safe ground there, but it also has the benefit of being considerably less polluting (1/10th) than coal.\n\nCoal is, however, only cheaper than offshore wind, which is a nascent technology in the US, and geothermal.  Its LCOE is at parity with utility scale solar.  Coal is basically a dying resource in advanced economies, a fact this video ignores. So, saying coal is extremely cheaper is just patently false.  It's why many coal companies are going bankrupt and many coal plants are closing, not because of Obama, but b/c it just not cheap anymore: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/14/the-wests-largest-coal-fired-power-plant-is-closing-not-even-trump-can-save-it/?utm_term=.5117ee246ffc\n\nNuclear also has the problem of being expensive, which is why Westinghouse recently filed for bankruptcy: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/westinghouse-toshiba-nuclear-bankruptcy.html?_r=0.

Your looking at the cost of wind without the factors of transporting that energy long distance, and storing it. \n\nWind will never be our primary source of energy, it's just not practical. Maybe in 50 years the battery technology will become good enough to support wind and solar storage on a large scale, but by then we will most likely have functioning fusion reactors which will outproduce the wind energy by orders of magnitude (literally). Not to mention the energy demand will have exponentially increased and renewable like wind and solar do max out (even at a theoretical 100% efficiency you would need so many wind/solar farms and energy storage facilities it would be impractical)\n\nI was talking about our main source of energy, now it is fossil fuels, nuclear is the only alternative at the moment. You cant run the US on wind or solar or a mix of the two, it's not viable. And Nuclear is not expensive, it has high upfront costs but once a plant is properly built it can produce extremely cheap energy for decades, potentially centuries with updates. When nuclear plants have economic troubles it isn't because it's an expensive resource, it is because it can take years for the power generated to pay for the fixed costs of the plant. \n\nThat is why China is excelling at nuclear energy right now. The Chinese government can give full funding for nuclear power in advance and reap the benefits later, while our economy is better suited for more short term gains. This is easily fixable, idiots like you need to snap out of your dream of pure renewable future and realize that our options are Nuclear or Fossil fuels.\n\nThis doesn't mean we wont use wind and solar, it just means that they will never be our main source of energy", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "pistol peiter"}

And they aren't just expensive to buy, but also require much more maintenance expenses due to the need of changing the batteries.\nDead batteries and panels need to be recycled and that requires even more energy (and it barely pays off as it is) which would make it even more expensive (a lot more). \nAlso, electric cars are rendered quite useless during winter when the temperatures are lower than 0C for Li-ion or -10C for lead-acid.\nYou have to pay the man in either case, because I assume you don't own a dozen of mines and refineries extracting and processing all types of rare elements and then another dozen of factories that manufacture it all into power plants.\nAnd unlike the alarmists would like you to believe, the resources we have would last for thousands of years with tight and shale oil and gas, as well as not yet discovered sources or theoretically possible ones (like clathrates or thorium).

Well I guess a better way of stating it is there is only one model of socialism we have seen. Most of the time when people advocate of the USA to be socialist, they are referring to Social Democracies. Which is a capitalist market economy core, with heavy regulation of the private sector. Since normally Liberals and people I talk to use Demark ,Norway, Canada it's obvious they are referring to Social democracies rather then Democratic socialism. I do think Socialism works well in theory but fails in practice and won't work until we can form a government which is a true democracy which it's hard to say if that will ever be possible. I agree though there are true socialist states, but Prager U tends to ignore social democracies. Who are some of the wealthiest happiest countries on earth. Personally I think the government role in the economy should be to insure that capitalism functions as it should in theory and to supply basic things needed for life to people as well as mega projects to costly for the private sector. Such as NASSA, scientific institutions, bridges and so on. \n\n\n\n(The definition depends on how you look at it) (Socialist as defined by Marxist origins) Socialism states everyone would be equal, making the same income and having same resources for work. With the people owning all resources. All states who have been called socialist have lacked equality, the lack of social classes that are needed to be defined as Socialism. I agree totally socialist states like any system when given extreme power are doomed to fail. True socialist nations will not function since in modern times the only way to organize that system is through a centralized power (The government). When any group is given total power it corrupts. Although the same thing would happen if capitalism was the only form of government. Socialism as a idea, still has never been applied successfully, so there has never been a socialist country since they can't form. All modern \"Socialist\" countries are a blend of Stallinism (I'll use that term to describe it) combined with the control and ideas of Marxism. This creates a perfect storm and a new form of government where the state creates a upper class, similar to a monarchy where the upper class \"own\" property land and housing. Russia, North Korea (Pretty much a monarchy though), Cubia use this idea. China has it's own thing going.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socialism\n(Definition for some terms in here although it's sorta weird)", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Evan Dugas"}

Because not every place in the world is close enough to alternate-energy sources to merit their use.\n\nI'm getting tired of this back and forth now so read this and shut up: http://www.coaleducation.org/q&a/10_reasons_why_coal.htm\n\nAnd I never changed anything. \"You can't just not use coal\" is not the same as \"you HAVE to use coal\". The only implication of the former statement is that it currently is not possible to not use coal to generate 100% electricity.\n\nHere's another article: http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/replacing-coal-with-clean-energy-let-me-count-the-ways\n\n\"Ignoring the costs, here are some of the ways the U.S. could replace enough coal power to meet an 80 percent clean energy sources target by 2035:\n\nWe could build 243 hydroelectric dams that have Hoover Dam's generating capacity (that’s 10 new dams a year, on average). Mind you, that means we would also need 243 mighty rivers like the Colorado that don’t already have dams on them. There aren't enough rivers left in the U.S. to support that number of large dams, and smaller dams alone can't generate enough electricity to replace coal power plants. \n\nWe could build 194,900 wind turbines, each having 2 megawatts (MW) of capacity (a typical size). That would mean building more than 8,000 new turbines each year, or 22 turbines a day, every day, for 24 years. Even if this is doable, we’d also have to overhaul the U.S. electrical grid, and add a way to store electricity, in order to safely and reliably use the intermittent flow of electricity that comes from wind turbines.  \n\nWe could build 64 new nuclear power plants the size of New York’s Indian Point power station. Since the Fukushima disaster in Japan last spring, however, that kind of construction rate, with nearly four nuclear plants being built each year, no longer seems realistic. And keep in mind, the U.S. hasn't built a new nuclear plant in over 20 years. \n\nWe could build 10,200 solar energy farms — but each one would have to be the size of Nevada’s Copper Mountain solar array, which is currently the country’s largest. The amount of space needed for this number of solar panels: an area about three times the size of Delaware.\n\nOr, we could keep using coal-fired power plants as long as they are outfitted to capture and store the CO2 exhaust instead of releasing it into the atmosphere — a technology called CCS, or carbon capture and sequestration. But using CCS makes a plant less efficient in generating electricity, so not only would every existing coal plant in the country need to be outfitted with CCS, but we would have to build 133 new plants that would also be equipped with CCS technology. At the moment, the U.S. doesn’t yet have a single coal-fired plant operating with CCS.\n\nWe could all improve our energy efficiency, but switching light bulbs won’t be enough to meet Obama's target. Even if everyone in the U.S. changed all their incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent lights, it would still only save about one percent of the total electricity needed to meet the 80 percent target.\n\nAll these options still involve getting about 20 percent of U.S. electricity from natural gas, which produces greenhouse gas emissions. And right now, all of the clean energy sources mentioned here are considerably more expensive than coal.\"\n\nLong story short: you can't just \"not use coal\", as I said all along.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "The Binary Epidemic"}

I would like to critique it though, if you don't mind.\n\nThe assumption that \"Electric cars are coal powered cars\" is a TERRIBLE assumption to make, because you are assuming that coal is the only means to generate electricity to power electric cars, which is totally false. There are many other greener ways to produce electricity (although coal produces alot more electricity quickly, that discussion is for another topic).\n\nSimply put, when you compare the CO2 emissions of an electric vs fossil fuel car on the road, OBVIOUSLY the electric car is MUCH cleaner than fossil fuel cars. There is no denying it, and I understand that your question is \"where do we GET all that electricity?\"\n\nThe problem with your point of view, is you are limiting the value and viability of electric cars solely from the belief that all electric cars must be powered from coal. If that was true, then electric cars may be a terrible idea. However, electricity CAN be generated cleanly, and coal is NOT a clean energy source as you already know, so hopefully the world will also change electrical generation methods to a cleaner method shortly following the transition to electric cars.\n\nThe core message i got from watching this video is the suggestion to the viewer that \"it's not worth it to switch to electric cars because electric cars = coal, and we should just stick to using fossil fuel cars...\" \nbut the reality is, we've tried that. It's still happening now. There are too many fossil fuel cars on the road spewing emissions, and the world finally found out that it CANNOT continue like this for the sake of all sacred life on earth. We need an alternative method, and that answer, is 'electric cars'. Now, whether or not there will be enough CLEAN electricity supply to meet the demand for electric cars is a different arguement, but adopting electric cars and dropping fossil fuel cars is definately a step forward in the right direction to a cleaner world. lets just hope that the electricity generation part also transitions from coal to green as well. :)", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Harry Shin"}

So, that electric car is causing SOME additional coal to be burned to provide it the electricity it needs.\n\nThe video NEVER suggests that electric cars can only get electricity from coal, simply that such is most typical historical case in the US.\n\nThe points you probably SHOULD have taken from the video are:\n1) Electric cars aren't as pure and chaste as you may think -- producing them and powering them currently creates a similar amount of pollution as operating a combustion vehicle does\n2) It may not make sense for the government to give the levels of subsidies for electric cars as it currently does because they don't pollute so much less that it's worth the expenditure.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "jahenders"}

Not even mentioning the fact the Tesla has pushed the other car manufacturers to step up their EV game.  \n\nHow green are EV's?  Well it all depends on your source of electricity.  In California driving a EV is similar to driving a car with with a gas mileage of 87 MPG, in certain parts of the US with electrical producing dominated by Coal then this drops to about 35-Mpg.  However the one constant is that the US electrical grid gets cleaner every year and moves to sources of electrical production that produce less emissions.  More than 2/3 of Americans live in a region where charging a electric car produces lower emissions than a car getting 50-Mpg.  EV's have a high emissions during manufacture, a smaller EV will have about 15% more emissions and a EV like a Tesla will be 68% higher.  However this quickly changes as soon as the cars are driven, with smaller EV's offsetting these high manufacturing emissions within 6-months and a EV's like a Tesla by 18-months.  \n\n In my opinion the application of the EV incentives has been great.  It has served to prime the market and advance the technology of EV's with a definitive sun-set built into the law.  Judging by the rate of advancement in EV's since the law was passed, it has served it's purpose.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Greg Brance"}

No US State produces all of their electricity from coal although a few US States come close but even that is changing.  Coal is a financial pariah right now because Natural Gas is killing it in price.  Natural Gas CHP Plants are very efficient in producing power even though they are still dirty sources of energy but make the EVs far more efficient relative to power derived from Coal.

{"cid": "Ugij344qxRY4wHgCoAEC.8IMeFYKSAFQ8OLjCwUH7Kz", "text": "+Jahenders  As it turns out, your assertion that most of our electricity comes from coal is wildly inaccurate.  \n\nAs of April 2015, coal powered just 33% of electricity in the US, a figure that has declined and will continue to do so.  It is expected to decline to 25% by 2022.  Natural gas accounts for another 33%, which is expected to rise to 38% by 2022.  Twenty percent comes from nuclear and the remainder mostly comes from renewable sources, such as hydro (6%), and from biomass, wind, and solar (7%).  Solar doubled its electric generation capacity in 2016 alone, outpacing coal, natural gas and nuclear combined, representing nearly two-thirds of all added electric generation capacity.\n\nWhy?  Cost.  The LCOE of onshore wind, solar PV and natural gas are currently cheaper than coal.  By 2022, they'll be cheaper than nuclear and coal, even if we were to go back to the dirty coal days of the 1980's.  Coal is just no longer economically viable.  It's a dying industry. China knows this, which is why they mothballed plans to build 13 coal-fired-plants last year and are gearing up to make a major push in solar, having already done so in hydro.  They also increased the number of EV charging stations by 65% in 2015.  By the end of the year, it was expected that China would have ten times the number of EV charging stations as the US.  By June of last year, they already had 81,000 to our 10,000.\n\nThe author of this video has a false agenda, thus their deliberate misrepresentation of facts (e.g. claiming most electric power comes from coal).\n\nAs it stands now, the US will likely lose out on the renewable energy jobs boom.  In 2015, China spent near 3 times as much on renewable energy than the US.  Expect that ratio to increase dramatically in 2017 and 2018.  We're too busy looking backward, making promises about lost coal jobs we can't bring back and milking the fossil fuel industry rather than looking ahead.\n\nThe stupid thing about this whole conversation is that it's not just about Climate Change anymore.  We're in the middle of a major energy transition that WILL happen over the next 20 years, and the counties that get onboard will prosper, and those that laugh about it, push back against it to tweak environmentalist, and continue to line the pockets of the fossil fuel industry will be left behind. The US is shooting itself in the foot.  When tech opportunities happened in the past, the US jumped at the opportunity. We didn't try to save horse and buggy manufacturers or beeper makers.

So, $7500 comes off you Adjusted Gross Income to determine your tax bill.  Thus, the pass-through is not exactly $7500, but a fraction of that.  You are not paying 7500 for anything.\n\nSecond, $7500 is the maximum value of the tax expenditure depending on the size of the car and its battery.  Most only qualify for tax expenditures of about 2500.\n\nThird, all manufacturers were restricted to tax expenditures for the first 200,000 cars they produced of that model and since the law sunsetted, the amount of the tax expenditure has declined by half.\n\nLastly and more importantly, if you accept the scientific consensus that Climate Change is happening, the benefits of taking gas-powered cars off the road is considerably greater than the value of the tax expenditure.   If you're a climate change denier, that argument won't matter to you.\n\nWhat I do know is that China is taking this seriously, and now has ten times the number of charging stations as the US.

Since falsities are as thick as joints at a Woodstock concert, it is best to focus on what one can observe and know directly.

(2)  Regulations, subsidies, institutional deception, and corruption all force an otherwise free market from making the wisest decisions.  (3)  There are many excellent technologies, both new and old that will help us deal with our energy problems and that includes efficient coal, natural gas, wind, solar, nuclear, and any thing else we can muster up to deal with things.  (4)  Electric cars are excellent tools when used appropriately, not forced on everyone, and not worshiped as some kind of \"earth-saver\".  The technology is arriving fast and has come of age with or without government intervention.  Instant full torque at the moment the light turns green is a pure pleasure I'd hate to see anyone denied.  The silence is beautiful as well as the absence of stains on the garage floor.  And the entire car including the lithium in the batteries is recyclable. (5)  We need to stop all the stupid fighting and keep our wits about us.  Only then can we make good decisions and treat each other in a civil way and build a better future, first keeping warm by the blue flame of natural gas and later something else when it is most sensible.

There is around 9.7KWh equivalent energy in 1litre of petrol (or gas as you Americans like to call it. 😉) so a fossil fuel car needs approximately 97KWh to travel 100km! Therefore the electric car is 4 times more efficient. Then, there is the maintenance. Fossil cars need oil changes every few thousand miles, did you include that? More electricity to refine the lubricating oil. What about the co2 involved in transportation? First of the crude, the of the finished products? A lot of the electric car manufactures are turning to renewable energy sources, see Teslas new factory in Nevada or HOMes EV plant in Germany.

You can't chose where it is going to be nor its dimensional characteristics. And the energy potential is given by the height of the waterfall, regardless of the volume. So a large reservoir with little height has a huge environmental impact while providing little output power. So, while Brazil is privileged to have so many water bodies being therefore able to have many hydroelectric power plants, during the drought the electricity competes with water supply for the people.

{"cid": "Ugi0rka2cW8O7XgCoAEC", "text": "It's scary so many dismiss this presentation off hand. The claims are not unreasonable. It seems many read certain implications into the claims. If so, then these are sourced from their own imaginations. An EV cannot significantly reduce CO2 emissions as compared to a conventional automobile unless the source of energy used to charge its battery is not derived from fossil fuels. However, even in this case the CO2 emissions are are substantial. After all, there are CO2 emissions associated with the production of the car and the production of the hardware used to produce the electricity that charges the battery. In many areas, most electricity is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels including dated coal fired steam plants. In these areas, the EV likely increases carbon emissions (all else equal). Today, when one considers the average EV, then indeed the arguments presented here are reasonable: the EV today simply does not substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Furthermore, they are a great deal more costly (all else equal). It should not be taboo to speak the truth. Do these facts somehow imply developing the EV is a bad idea? Of course not!  For those who desire to reduce CO2 emissions, then improving the performance and driving down the costs of EV's will facilitate ever increasing numbers of EV sales that will, in turn, reduce dependence on petroleum as a transport fuel while leveraging the abilities for renewable energy technologies to contribute to this end. In the long run, the EV can be part of a low carbon future. In my strong opinion, those who work toward this goal should not ignore the facts lest genuine problems fail to get addressed.  So, \"environmentalists\" please get your collective heads out of your asses. Do not deny facts, but think and work to solve the problems you perceive. There will be a day when most and finally all energy is produced from net carbon neutral sources like renewables and nuclear energy. However, that day is far into the future - most likely no sooner than the end of this century at best. We have A LOT more CO2 to release until that time! It's not good or bad, it simply IS. I strongly expect no problems will be caused by further increasing CO2 emissions despite how so many like to imagine otherwise.

Also, define \"efficient\". Approximately 65% of the electricity used to charge an EV battery is finally converted to work in the vehicle drive train. If charged from the grid, then this factor of 0.65 is multiplied by the overall grid efficiency. So, in most cases, the overall \"efficiency\" is on par with conventional vehicles. Of course, it depends on how one chooses to define \"efficiency\". How about using cost as a proxy? Well, in that case the EV is not quite superior. Considering the average cost of electricity in California, then fully charging a Nissan Leaf 24 KWh battery from a very low state of charge costs roughly $4.56. On average, this will propel the car over 73 miles. A conventional car with similar performance as a Leaf will get at least 30 mpg on gasoline. So, this is roughly $1.87 per gallon of gas equivalent. How much is saved in fuel over a 150,000 mile life? With gasoline at $2.50 per gallon, then on the order of $3150 in fuel costs are avoided. Not bad - or is it? Will this compensate for the increased price of the EV (NOT including subsidies because, after all, that's theft), and considering the COST involved in reduced range, diminishing battery capacity, and time required to charge the battery? I suppose it depends on the user. For most people, it's not a worthwhile trade to make. Maybe a plug-in Prius is a better alternative?

Whether or not we drive anything at all, Coal power plants are still emitting CO2 into the atmosphere.  If the electricity is being generated constantly, you might as well use it.  This video treats the emissions of coal as the electric car's own emissions which is non sequitur.   To explain what I mean, here's an example:  You walk into a doughnut shop that makes 500 to 1000 doughnuts a day.  At high traffic hours (aka breakfast) 500 - 700 people buy doughnuts, totaling around 700 - 830 doughnuts bought. The doughnut shop is left with 170 doughnuts left over that is thrown away.  Electric cars represent the 170 doughnuts or energy left over by the power plants.  In other words, whether or not someone uses the energy, it will be wasted anyway, or left over as surplus.   Currently, Electric cars make use of this surplus energy if the cars are left to charge during those hours of surplus energy.

The fact remains that the US DOE, and other well respected researchers also, have clearly estimated that it takes approximately 21,000 Btu or 6KWhr of electrical energy to refine a gallon of gasoline from a barrel of oil. That's why you generally see large electrical sub-stations collocated with oil refineries.  Whilst electric cars might initially be driven on electricity derived from coal powered power stations, they will only get greener on the increasing emergence and adoption of renewable energy.

{"cid": "UggRxXSqYft9sXgCoAEC", "text": "This video is so poorly done that it is hard to know where to begin. But, let's try:\n1. Electric cars are NOT coal powered cars. Less than one third of power in the United States comes from coal and that number is shrinking daily. In fact, Obama ensured that coal plants are either going to go green or shut down, which essentially means that they will not survive. If you want to say that they are \"natural gas\" powered then that is at least accurate since that is where most of the energy in the U.S. now comes from.\n2. Renewable energy sources have more than doubled in the United States in the last 10 years and yet you say that in 25 years from now it will only grow by 3%. Thank you, Exxon, for your opinion, but we will be well beyond that mark by 2020. The cost per kW for solar panels is but a fraction of what it was at the turn of the century and is fueling home installations as well as corporate use.\n3. If renewable energy gains merely keep at the same pace of doubling every 10 years then we can expect it could make up nearly two thirds of all electricity production before 2040.\n4. Your (inaccurate) proof is not that electric cars are not green but that electric power is not green. While electric power is getting cleaner, I certainly agree that it is not truly green. We will not get there until 100% of power comes from renewable and nuclear power. However - it is already vastly cleaner than dino juice.\n5. An electric car purchased today gets cleaner every day as our energy mix gets cleaner. Can you name a gas guzzler whose fuel economy improves over time?\n6. You compare a Nissan Leaf to a \"comparable\" (ahem) diesel? Convenient that you picked an oil burner that has much lower CO2 emissions. I love spin zones, but come on - how many people drive diesel cars in the United States? (And speaking of harming people from emissions ... Know anyone with asthma?)\n7. You insinuate that all but 14% of energy in the U.S. is dirty coal. Not true. 20% is nuclear (CO2 free) and 33% is natural gas which emits half the CO2 and does not have the dirt problem.\n8. Most auto charging happen during the evening / off-peak when there is currently spare power. (Yes, that may change if everyone goes electric -but there are answers for that.)\n9. Many electric car owners, including my neighbor, charge their car with solar panels on their home. Yes, electric car owners tend to go out of their way to avoid all CO2 emissions possible.\n10. Owners of electric cars often purchase \"green energy\" from their power plant - so many of the farms of renewable energy coming online are a direct result of individuals paying more to save the environment. Therefore, you cannot assume you know the energy mix that was used to power an electric vehicle.\n11. Lithium batteries are 100% recyclable and are used in our laptops, cell phones and just about every product made today. Yes, it is a rare earth material that requires ripping up the planet to extract and there is a plan to stop using it (see below). Tell us, again, how you can extract oil and gas without digging into the Earth? And how recyclable is that black tar?\n12. Battery technology is evolving rapidly which is quickly dropping the price of electric cars and their distance. There are new battery products expected to hit the market over the next 5-10 years that are better than current batteries (weigh less, charge faster) and do not use lithium.\n13. The dramatic advances in battery tech are due in large part to the current electric car market.\n14. The greening of power plants is also due in part to the electric car market.\n15. Did you conveniently forget that the oil industry has received billions of dollars of subsidies? Electric car tax write-off's are but a small fraction of what the United States perpetually gives the fossil fuel providers. \n\nAs if your skewed and inaccurate portrayal of those trying to save the planet were not condescending enough, you also add choice bits like \"while electric car owners may cruise around feeling virtuous\" to then transition into the middle finger salute about how you (falsely) believe that electric cars are no cleaner. In fact, this whole video feels like nothing more than propaganda for the oil companies to allow gas burners to think that they can continue burning gasoline at will because electric cars are no better.\n\nIf you want to make an accurate comparison in the future, feel free to contact me and I would be happy to put you in touch with non-oil company executives that actually know about the subject matter.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Johnmichael Monteith"}

Tractor trailers still need to deliver goods to super markets for food while burning dirty diesel. Same goes for locomotives. There are pro's and con's to using batteries.  I'm in the electrical industry and unless someone comes up with an engineering miracle, I can't see EV's catching on any time soon.   If they were truly serious about replacing fossil fuels, we'd be using a lot more nuclear power.  Problem with nuclear is that nobody wants it in their backyard.  Next thing will be the greenies protesting airlines.  Way too many hypocrites in this world.  We have world leaders like Obama that don't even blink at the thought of burning fossil fuels to jet set to his favorite holiday retreat, then turns around and tells us we need to drive EV's.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "The New Minority"}

Natural gas power plants are about twice as efficient as car engines, and renewables emit close to 0 emissions. Even coal, the dirtiest of the 3 biggest electric generation methods in the US is about 50% more efficient than car engines. So, if your car gets an average mix of electric generation, then your car will be at about 59% efficiency, almost than triple that of a standard gasoline car. Assuming, as you did in this video, a gasoline car will emit about 18 metric tons of co2 over a 90,000 mile lifetime, electric cars would only emit 6 tons. 18 plus 16 is 34 metric tons, and 25 plus 6 is 31 metric tons, so your math checks out there. This is still better than normal cars but not by much. However, you assume that the average car has a 90,000 mile lifespan, when, in reality, people keep their cars for 11 years on average and drive 13,000 miles a year on average, so people drive their cars about 150,000 miles, on average. This means that gas cars would emit 30 tons of co2 by driving, whereas electric cars would emit 10 tons on average. 25 plus 10 is 35, whereas 16 plus 30 is 46, so electric cars would save about 11 tons on average.

{"cid": "UggRpD23O5RoX3gCoAEC", "text": "This is misleading. California, for instance, uses coal in only 0.7% of its electric generation. Out of California's 66,105 MW of electric generating capacity, 60.7% comes from natural gas, 20.2% from hydroelectric dams, 6.9% from nuclear, 4.2% from geothermal, and 3.1% from wind. AND, by 2020, state law requires that California obtain 1/3rd of its electricity from renewable sources. Moreover, the top two electric car states, Washington and Hawaii (California is third in electric car percentage as of 2014), don't use much coal either.  Coal fired plants, which are going out of favor in the United States, are found mostly in the eastern and southern United States (Texas is the worst) where you don't find as many electric cars purchased.\n\nWHAT IS MOST MISLEADING IS HERE IS THE STATISTIC REGARDING THE CO2 amount used to produce the battery. That statistic, which was given short shrift in this video, assumes that the battery will just be thrown away when it is past it's useful life. That's wrong. Although electric cars and hybrids are so new that only a few cars have had to have batteries replaced, the batteries are mostly recycled and the manufacturers, like Tesla, has long been aware that batteries recycling makes the carbon footprint much less of an issue and those companies have long been doing something about it. \n\nIn fact, regular car batteries are actually the MOST recycled products in the world. And the batteries in hybrids and all electric cars contain metals that are expensive and highly desirable to recyclers. You would be stupid to just throw away any electric car or hybrid battery, because you would be throwing away a lot of money. As such, the metals (and sometimes just the batteries themselves) are used again and again, substantially lowering the CO2 rate needed for the mining and manufacturing in the 2nd product and thus, lowering the amount of CO2 produced overall hybrid and electric cars.\n\nMoreover, as renewable energy is becoming more and more available, electric cars will become more and more C02 friendly. Will they reach a point where the CO2 footprint is ZERO? No. Of course, not. But every little bit helps and our carbon footprints must be reduced more and more if we are going to solve our climate change problems. Is the electric car a panacea? No. But policy makers have to weigh the benefits and challenges of making electric cars and hybrids versus doing nothing now and in the future when renewable energy is more available and coal plants are used less. Creating an electric car market NOW, instead of waiting for the optimum time when coal plants are no longer used, is stupid. First, no matter how to you look at it, electric and hybrid cars do produce less CO2 than regular cars NOW and this will only get better in the future. Electrics and hybrids reduce CO2 NOW. Not 20 years from now. And the technology will only get better and better now that big manufacturers are working on it. \n\nIf the producers of this video and the climate change naysayers would like to propose other solutions than just doing the same old thing and pumping out more and more CO2, I'd like to hear it.

Cars are often refereed to as \"zero emissions\" but do they really?\nA. zero emissions is denoting a road vehicle that emits no pollutants from its exhaust. Electric cars do this, they don't have an exhaust. Does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nMore than 1/3 of the lifetime Co2 emission from an electric vehicle used to make the car itself.\nActually correct but this is mainly due to our dependence on fossil fuels to power the machines we use to mine and manufacture. \n\nYour stats on the Nissan leaf 31 tons vs 34 tons for diesel Mercedes.\nPlease see above point for a easy understanding of why there so close currently.\n\nYour points on the billions of grants loans and tax write off's make me laugh. this kind of subsidy is tiny compared to that the money/scale that has been invested in the fossil fuel industry over the years when we first started using that too look how rich they are now the power plants have been running past there expected life span for years. Climate change is real and to continue on our current path of co2 is going to irreversibly change the planet if we dont react by 2050. \n\nThat brings me to your point on deaths,  this is based on the specific and continued use of coal. One of the fastest dying industry's today. As the energy mix is changing those statistics dont truly reflect what the deaths will be in 5 years with a different mix. \n\nYour next point on renewables by 2040 is even more far fetched, the US use of renewables went up by 3% in the last 10 years and the rate of adoption is increasing, even if it stayed flat it would be closer 27% by 2040 and after COP21 all our country's are legally obligated to reduce there carbon 80% by 2050 which will only increase this effect. I wont even comment on the 1% less fossil fuel by 2040 common sense can fill that in.\n\nIn conclusion, Are Electric cars really green?\nYes defiantly and our continued efforts to adopt renewables and develop more efficient environmentally friendly ways to manufacture will increase the margin in total co2 emissions over the next 34 years and onward.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Neil"}

Equally, there's the very real possibility that the methods for mining/producing cars will also go greener. I'm convinced the start up CO2 cost should be significantly lower, maybe not for the first generation of electric cars, but certainly years from now.\n\nAmerica also shouldn't be the shining example of energy distribution. They are trailing far behind the rest of the world in terms of renewable energy and with America as the leading example this math basically becomes as pessimistic as possible.

This presentation assumes that power generation in the US (and any other country for that matter) is reliable solely on the power plants that uses coal as their main source of fuel.  But the case is not that. In fact, when we plug in our EVs to recharge, we're plugging them not to the power line of specific coal-powered plant, but to the national grid. Electricity in the national grid are provided by the all sorts of power plants which, in addition to the power plants that use fossil fuels, also includes hydro-electric power plants, geo-thermal power plants, wind power plants and solar power plants. If you take that into account, then this calculation of how much equivalent CO2 is emitted by EVs will go down a lot less than just 4-5 tons compared to conventional cars. And in some countries, for example Germany, produces up to 90%  of their national power from renewable energy sources. \n\n2. Yes, the EV manufacturers right now are mainly dependent on the national grid to run their factories. But let's not forget the long term - the gigafactory of Tesla that's being built in Nevada which will run solely on renewable energy and over it's lifespan is going to leave a lower carbon footprint than a conventional car factory does in a year. \n\n3. Let's not kid ourselves, the shift to renewable energy for power production is being hampered because of how heavily our economic system is dependent on the price of per barrel of oil. Until our priorities are not primarily financial, we cannot move towards energy generation from renewable sources. \n\nYes,  the battery is still dependent on the lithium.

For starters, I'm glad you brought up the whole argument that electric cars shift pollution away from city centres, but you failed to address this argument correctly:\n\nYou went on to say that coal pollutes more than an internal combustion engine and therefore this will result in more pollution overall - and thus more deaths - but this is simply false, precisely FOR the reason you completely ignored; the power plants are AWAY from city centres.  So in actual fact, even if pollution is greater, there will actually be less deaths as a result because the bulk of that pollution is in the middle of nowhere, NOT a city centre.  In truth, though, the gist I've gotten from most of my research on the subject has contradicted yours and suggested coal plants are cleaner than combustion engines due to scale-efficiency.\n\nSecondly, your entire video is working on the basis of assumption that coal will always remain dominant; this couldn't be further from the truth, as the U.S. is actually currently transitioning over to natural gas, and an electric car powered by natural gas is far cleaner than one powered by coal.\n\nFinally, you complain about government subsidies towards electric car R&D, but without R&D these cars will never improve.  We NEED them to improve.  Oil is finite, so money spent on the next solution is money well spent.  Besides which, the individual contribution from any single taxpayer towards EV incentives is less than a dollar, so it won't actually affect anyone's lives.  Being dependant on oil 20 years later, however, WILL affect people's lives.  You've got to think outside the box; think ahead.\n\nThere are a few other videos on this subject here on YouTube, one conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and another conducted by a private individual.  Both of those surveys conclude that electric cars are the correct route to be taking.\n\nAs another commenter aptly states \"This title should read \"Are Electric cars really green at present time?\" which is spot on.  You're basically saying we shouldn't focus on electric cars because they aren't clean enough.  What you SHOULD be doing is looking at their future potential - that's what matters.  To put this into perspective, electric cars have far, far more future potential to become cleaner.  Gasoline vehicles do NOT, which is why manufacturers - who have already exhausted the limits of pollution reduction technology - are starting to shift towards hybrids with electric motors to meet emission regulations.\n\nYou're awfully closed-minded for a Scandinavian, that's all I can say.  You need to make fewer assumptions.  Who's to say we won't have new, superior batteries by 2020, that require a fraction of the materials?  What's to say we don't experience a home solar boom, or countries don't shift more heavily towards less-polluting power generation?  What's to say about those people who live in areas where coal is low-to-non-existent as a power source, or those who live in renewable-heavy regions?

Economist would call CO2 an \"externality\", meaning it's a by-product of economic activity that has a negative effect on society as a whole. The simplest way to address an externality is to simply tax it. If America were to dramatically cut its corporate tax rate, eliminate most corporate tax loopholes and deductions and then just implement a simple VAT-style tax on carbon we wouldn't have to spend any money. We could do this in a way that was 100% revenue neutral (not a hike in overall taxation) and it'd probably be better for our economy than having a ridiculously high corporate tax rate that's easy for politically connected interests to game.\n\nNeither party wants to do this though. The Democrats would much prefer feel-good measures that, as an added side benefit, let them dole out money to cronies while the Republicans tend to hail from coal and oil rich states or from agricultural areas that love the welfare program that is ethanol subsidies.\n\nI'm not saying this is how we should go about addressing the impact of humans on climate.

This will never get implemented, as many vocal people still don't care about this issue, especially considering the important investments necessary. \n\nAs for the subsidies, it may seem unfair, but currently, the proportion of this objectively better car, if only because of it's acceleration and mechanical simplicity, is staggeringly low. Hence, this incentive is a good way to jumpstart the electric car industry, that need an initial incentive. \n\nLet's bear in mind that as the public interest in electric cars grows, so will policies that will help with a cleaner energy production. Staying away from electric cars altogether on the pretext that it may be advantageous RIGHT NOW will never give this project the required energy to kick it in motion. \n\nAlso, let's bear in mind that this analysis is very dependent on local implementation.  Subsidies are not the same everywhere, and so does the power generation. Hawaii for example get an increasingly larger portion of it's electricity from Solar Panels because other sources are unreliable. Hence, I saw a very large proportion of electric cars there on my last vacation (in december 2015). At first it made me hopeful that it was a nice trend, but research later showed me it is mainly confined to Hawaii, due to their energy generation situation. \n\nAs for me, in Quebec, where 98% of our electricity comes from water dams, it would be a very clean way indeed to move around.

{"cid": "Ugi42DKGdQcXi3gCoAEC", "text": "Pretty dumb to say electric cars are coal-powered. Coal is on the way out in the US because natural gas is cheap. And electricity from natural gas more often than not comes from combined cycle gas turbines, which produce energy from natural gas with almost TWICE the thermal efficiency of a typical coal plant. Even if you took that gas as CNG and burnt it in your car, there is NO way you get a 65%+ thermal efficiency from an ICE in a car. So, wrong and wrong.\n\nRenewables are also ramping up a lot faster than what this guy is saying. Not only that, but there are countries, Canadian provinces and US states where most of the energy ALREADY COMES from renewables, e.g. Oregon, Washington, BC, Québec, etc. In these regions it makes absolute sense to use electric vehicles vs. imported, expensive fossil fuels.\n\nOn the ICE side, he glosses over the insane NOX and PM emissions from diesel vehicles, which are responsible for many, many more premature deaths, respiratory ailments and morbidity in urban populations around the world than coal power is. Besides, the MPG rating of diesel vehicles is quite high, which makes the comparison with electric vehicles look better than it should. Try this with a typical V6 2.0 lt gas engine and you quickly find out that the lifecycle CO2 emissions of an electric car are much lower, especially once you start driving 20k miles/year or more. Add in the health costs of the NOX and PM emissions from, say, that Audi car (i.e. VW) and you quickly see that the environmental footprint of ICE's (especially diesels) is way higher than advertised here.\n\nOh, and another thing. He also fails to contemplate a little thing called \"regenerative braking\", which absolutely no fossil fuel car can do, while even the cheapest electric vehicle can. On urban driving, recovering kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost is just smart, and also reduces the need to recharge. Did he include this in his calculation? What % coal, gas, hydro, nuclear and renewables did he use? And, even if his figures are true, it no small irony than an electric car is already LESS environmentally damaging than an ICE, which has been undergoing constant optimisation for the last 120 years. \n\nOn a personal note, I am currently sick with some sort of respiratory inflammation because of the diesel fumes from busses and cars where I'm from. The air literally smells like sulfur and is pungent to breathe, and this is despite recent $10b+ USD investments in hydrotreatment and new refinery capacity to produce \"cleaner\" diesel.

Too many old cars in junkyards just rotting away when they could be rebuilt and be back out on the road again. Some cars as early at 10 years end up in junkyards when the lifespan of a car is really 30 years or more if properly maintained. You might have to replace or fix the engine in that car but at that point, the car 'isn't worth it'. So you put in a new engine, wouldn't the overall worth of the car go up? A car that is worth $400 with a dead engine on it you can put the new engine in and drive it around for another 5 years it'd still still for $1000 because of the new engine. The economics of how much a car is worth based on age and mileage doesn't or shouldn't mean much if the car is well maintained. If the body/frame is in good shape that's really all you need. It's even worth more if it's a classic car or will be in the future, being a popular car if you plan to keep it for 50 years.\n\nGoing back to electric cars, once the battery is shot on that car people will junk the car. If it's 5 or more years and it's paid off, that car may be junked. Even if not, you're still putting more money into a vehicle that isn't really all that environmental friendly. Cars are too disposable these days, even accidents.. where insurance companies often will mark the car as totaled. I crashed a car in 2003, all that was wrong with it was that it needed a new front axle and a bit of frame/body work. But the cost to fix it was more than what it is to buy a new car. Some people will always want a new car anyway but there's also those who want to keep their cars. But for the sake of the economy we got to keep pumping out more cars which also pump up more C02 in the atmosphere. This is the real problem.\n\nAnd you're really not doing much by swapping a gasoline car for an electric one. It's still a pollution issue. Every time you buy a new car you are buying a car that added more pollution. If anything i'll probably get a second car so that way i can work on the first one without having to worry about everything being disconnected when i have to be somewhere. Plus the older the car is, the harder it will be to find parts.. unfortunately but this is what happens when people junk their cars, something i would prefer not to do.

This means that in many countries with cleaner power systems than US, you have a substantial climate advantage in using electric cars. \n\nMoreover, in US, a good climate strategy would be to decarbonize the power production, and combine that with electrification of the transportation. Then you gain dubbly from the decarbonization. He mentions that renewables are unusfficient, to some extent yes. But there are many energy sources that are cleaner than coal, such as nuclear, and even gas powered plants. \n\nIn countries such as mine, Sweden, there are no coal fired plants and the electricity is almost CO2 free, making electric cars a very good solution to even further decrease our climate impact. \n\nBut, ok, the first step in a healthy climate policy is to reduce the coal power and second to electrify transportation.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Peter Andersson"}

Not only that, they have no reliability. On non-windy days, they make no electricity whatsoever, meaning power to your house could be cutting out randomly every now and then.\n\nSolar, again, has no constant energy. Solar does not work during the night, at all. Not only that, but solar power can be defeated by a CLOUDY DAY. So it can never replace any significant portion of the power. Unless of course you rack up the fossil fuel generators at night. Which is stupid, because it takes much more energy to get a power plant started than it does to keep it running smoothly. Solar power is incredibly expensive, and it's not going to be any fraction of our power at all in even half a century. BUT we'll already have invented a new, better source of energy by then! Like GEOTHERMAL.\n\nFar more effective, geothermal has a constant and unyielding flow of electricity. The mantle of the Earth doesn't exactly cool down or heat up at all, so geothermal has a constant energy yield, and unlike wind power, geothermal does not kill birds constantly. Geothermal also doesn't explode during a storm. Geothermal is and always will be, THE renewable energy source.\n\nAlthough, nuclear power plants are far cheaper and unlike crazy people will have you believe, they are not dangerous.\n\nOf the two power plants that have ever failed, One was being stress tested, and they overloaded the generator, and the other at Fukushima was hit by a goddamn tsunami. There are plenty of places in America where a nuclear power plant would be completely safe. It's not like they explode randomly. And when nuclear power plants melt down, it's not like the entire goddamn place melts down, just the reactor core melts down.\n\nAnd Nuclear melt downs are not going to kill anybody.

{"cid": "Uggq7lbhcJpih3gCoAEC", "text": "I question some of the figure as presented in this video, at least with regards to the comparison of CO2 production caused by the production and usage of two different vehicles.  Besides the fact that electricity does not need to be generated from Coal exclusively either, I'm willing to accept the comparison of strictly coal production as a source of energy to power electric vehicles as used in this example.  Still, missing from this argument is to point out that energy generated at a large scale power plant is far more efficient than generating that power from small scale energy production plants... like engines in an automobile.  \n\nFurthermore, completely missing from this is the energy consumption issues for even producing gasoline in the first place from crude oil at refineries, something which strangely requires more energy to produce a gallon of refined gasoline than is produced by that same gallon of gasoline.  That energy cost comes from the fractional distillation process, and while some petroleum refineries use some of the crude oil petroleum feed stocks to create that energy (aka two plus gallons of crude oil make one gallon of gasoline or other petroleum products) often that energy comes from electric heaters to warm that oil above the boiling point of gasoline... and that energy comes from coal powered generating plants.  In other words, you can even think of gasoline fueled vehicles as being coal powered as well through precisely the same reasoning, and this CO2 budget was clearly not taken into account by the video creator.\n\nOn top of that, the energy distribution system for electricity is far more efficient than the energy distribution system for petroleum products.  A proper comparison for the effective costs would also include that figure.\n\nI'm not saying that the argument made here is completely inaccurate, but it is incomplete and definitely biased.  In particular, I question the death counts claimed at the end of the video were highly misleading unless specific details can be demonstrated.  The assertion that electric vehicles produce more air pollution than gasoline internal combustion engines is decidedly absurd, particularly when the same argument can be used that nearly identical amounts of electric generation would be required to produce the gasoline needed in a comparable vehicle.\n\nAlso missing completely from this is the argument where American coal reserves are more than sufficient to produce the energy needed to power all of those coal powered electric plants, removing the need to engage in wars to secure petroleum stocks like the crazy adventures in Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.

Some of us have actually invested in renewable energy. Arguing that electric cars are coal power cars because the USA is a country that relies on coal for electricity only proves that the USA is going down the wrong path with it's energy policy, not that electric cars are a bad idea. Your argument is built on the false premise that coal power is the only way to make electricity. If you phase out coal power (has many countries have proven possible), this whole fatalist line of reasoning falls apart.\n\n2- I don't know anything about Lithium mining, but I know one thing: it's an infinitely recyclable fundamental element. The incentive to recycle a 218 kg 24 kWh Li-ion batterie is pretty high ($$$). Therefore, the Lithium only needs to get extracted once from the earth, and then it can be used to power cars for ever. Sure, every recycling produces CO2 (human breathing produces CO2), but I don't believe the numbers you used reflect this likely diminution in mining activity over time (assuming the global number of active cars worldwide levels off at some point).\n\n3- The video assumes reducing CO2 is the only reason to switch to electric cars. Petroleum is a non-renewable ressource. We will need to find an alternative at some point. Some of us can see the clouds on the horizon. We might not agree on when peek-oil will happen (some believe it already has) or what the real world consequences will be, but it will happen.\n\n4- Have you ever driven an electric car?

So what&#39;s the trend for battery manufacturing costs? They are falling like a stone. It's halved every few years.

That fossil fuel use will only decrease by only 1 percent by 2040.\n\nThe younger generations are much more active about climate change, sustainable energy technology is developing fast, and is almost more viable than fossil fuels. Many new leaders including China and Canada and many places in Europe are taking action against climate change already. There is also Fusion which has finally reached the point where it could be ready soon. China is confident it will have a reactor by 2030.\n\n2. That the creation of electric vehicles produces more emissions than petrol cars.\n\nSince more expensive cars in general cost more, and the manufacturing methods are similiar, the issue seems to be the battery.\n\nThis seems irrelevant to me. The most efficient petrol car burns 5 litres of fuel for every 100km. For every litre of fuel burnt at least 2 kg of CO2 is released. That's 10 kilos per 100km. Average driving distance is 13,000 miles, which is 20,000 km.\n\n20,000/100 = 200. 200 times 10 kg, is 2 metric tons. That's for efficient cars though. So 2 tons each year, is going to emit a lot compared to the costs of the batteries, which at one estimate was about 10 kg of CO2, which is about 4-5 tons for a tesla(400 kilo pack). Just not relevant.\n\nEven if we consider mining, thousands of tons of rare earth minerals being mined is nothing compared to billions of tons of coal being mined.\n\n3. That Electric vehicles are not that more efficient. Since they still use electricity from fossil fuels.\n\nA study I read showed that even running on Electricity from coal plants, the electric vehicles are more efficient than any petrol car. It produced as much CO2 equivalent as 54 mpg. This is becuase, lots of small petrol piston engines, are less efficient than 1 big coal plant. By a large amount. Something like 10 - 30 percent of the energy in petrol cars from burning is converted into kinetic energy, the rest is sound and heat. Whereas a coal plant turns 70 percent of its energy into electricity. This is becuase it is much more complex and efficient.\n\nAlso the rise of sustainable energy, which is actually more prevalent in certain areas, will reduce that from being 30% more efficient than petrol engines, to as much as 100%. If you were to factor in home solar panels and a tesla powerwall battery for charging, that would also allow much larger reductions.\n\nThere is also the range lie. This one is pretty serious. No battery goes out after 90,000 miles. The tesla batteries could go 2,000 cycles before 70% capacity, a reduction of 30%, on the model S at release. With a 300 mile range, that is 600,000 miles. I've heard the number 3,000 cycles been thrown around alot, so its more like 900,000 km. That means on coal power, or whatever they used as the baseline, the actual reduction on emissions is 10 times greater. 40 tons. If you use a car for 50 years, that is 100 tons of CO2 from the petrol, in a home solar system, that would be 0.\n\nThere is also the fact that an electric vehicle will last longer. They use less moving parts, are newer so they haven't figured out how to shorten the lifespan yet, and the only issue is the batteries which will easily go about 50 years and still have over 70% charge for the average driver. Only having to replace the battery instead of the body saves a lot of CO2.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "CMDR Dantae"}

Plus, less maintenance costs are expected for electric motors compared to engines. As battery prices continue to fall, the initial price difference will narrow, which will give EVs the decisive advantage in total cost.\n\nIn other words, it is not just about \"feels.\"", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "dMb"}

Most oil (~75%) is used for fuels. Reduce the need for fuels, and instantly that 40% figure for domestic production goes up, all without drilling a single new well.

If Sanders is elected (and gets his way), he'll destroy the whole oil & gas industry. He will then offer handouts to move workers into a govt-subsidized and -approved industry. IMO, that sounds like welfare employment because the jobs likely won't exist without govt paying for them.\n\nBut rants aside, even with President Obama's policies, the domestic oil & gas industry expanded and bacome the world leader. It's been long thought that OPEC maintains the current low price of oil specifically to shut down the US' fracking operations. It's a tactic they've used before. Recent rig counts shows that a lot of rigs are leaving the US (again). OPEC still have a lot of influence over the US' domestic oil industry. That's why I honestly believe the best action is to stop importing oil. It may result in a bit of pain for US consumers, but the overall economic benefit, such as reducing the trade deficit, is worth it.\n\nI disagree about the viability of EVs. Already they are near price-competitive with gasoline cars. You spend about $10k more up front, but about $10k less over its life because electricity is cheaper & more efficient. There's also the plus of much reduced maintenance with no oil changes, no transmission service, etc. Battery prices are still dropping--GM reported costs at $145/kWh, half what it was a few years ago. You can also bet Tesla is under $200/kWh with the gigafactory. In another 5 yr, the price may be under $100/kWh. EVs will not completely replace ICE vehicles, but I do think in 5 yr to 10 yr, there will be tipping point where an EV option is only a couple thousand premium, like an upgrade to a different engine. With time, consumers' 'soft' worries, like range, will lessen.\n\nI like Pickens' proposal from a few years back. Large trucks & vans (garbage trucks, delivery vans, buses, etc.) can easily convert to natural gas. The natural gas would be redirected from our electricity supply & replaced with renewables, primarily wind. (Oklahoma's--Picken's home state--ample wind resources are no doubt a factor in his plan.) So combining his plan with EVs becomes:\n- Increase electricity from renewables like wind & solar\n- Use the natural gas saved to power cars, particularly large vehicles that are best suited for natural gas\n- Increase use of EVs, especially for commuter & city cars that are best suited for electricity.\n- The reduced diesel (from the large vehicles) and gas (from commuters) would be enough to reduce oil consumption by 20%, we could cut ties with OPEC.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "dMb"}

No electric car before the last 2 decades has had a range over 100 miles. That has changed now, and with vehicles that can both reduce costs and keep a range of 200 miles or more, the era of the electric car has arrived.\n\nNobody wants a car that costs a ridiculous price, when they can get a better one, which is why most electric vehicles haven't done that well, and nobody will go for an electric car at lower prices with their low range. Now that technology has allowed cars with high range and low costs, the benefits of an electric car, from convenience, space, safety, better driving and now onsite emissions, will become much more visible and expressed, and they will become a better option than gas cars.\n\nSure, government subsidies have had a part to play, but its a new technology with great benefits that will massively reduce oil costs. If even a third of all vehicles in the US were electric, it wouldn't need to import oil from Saudi Arabia or even Russia, and could rely on its own oil, helping the economy greatly.\n\nNot to mention, it's not as if electric cars get that many subsidies. Tesla paid for its government loan the year after, and the Nevada loan was for a factory that will double the world's production of batteries, a worthy investment. Most companies could have likely survived without government loans, by selling stocks, but that would have diluted ownership of the company.\n\nThe only other subsidy, is the federal credit of $7,500 which goes straight to customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing, Verizon and GE paid no taxes from 2008 to 2013 and still receive tax rebates of $4.1 billion.\n\nThe fact is that gasoline and diesel engines have always been far easier to make, more convenient, more powerful, far faster to refuel, and in most cases, even safer.

The Tesla Model S and X use simple lithium ion panasonic cells, about 7,000 of them. In a laptop, the charge cycle doesn't allow heavy usage, but with a cooling system to minimise damage to the cells, it can last quite a while. This would have been possible with or without government subsidies which you massively overstate. The technology is from mobile devices.\n\nIn the 1990s, I heard that california tried to force car manufacturers to produce evs, after it ended, they confiscated and destroyed all of them. Similar reactions to other attempts are quite common, and some companies even tell customers not to buy the electric/hybrid vehicles over their petrol ones.\n\nThe subsidies you speak of go directly to the customer and have little effect at the prices of the Tesla S, not to mention I believe the Federal credit of $7,500 doesn't last past 200,000 units sold. If you think that only electric car companies get subsidised, then you are pretty ignorant as plenty of other corporations get a lot of government subsidies, Boeing for example owes the government $13 billion.\n\nNew research shows that millions die each year due to pollution, while air quality has improved, that has a lot to do with the type of gasoline and coal we burn. Also, coal use has only increased internationally, due to developing countries like China, if you look at pollution levels in China, they have ridiculous problems. In America, the same amount of coal has be burnt, with only a little difference, but it is a far smaller percentage of the electricity produced.\n\nSo no, coal use has not increased, oil has, but that has mitigated by fuels that reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.\n\nAgain, oil comes mostly from other countries, fracking can also cause damage to the environment when done improperly. Lithium however, provides much more energy, that can be reused and recycled over a long period of time. Not to mention alternatives in battery technology. Electric vehicles also massively reduce emissions even when electrical production is mostly coal.\n\nWe chose petrol becuase it was easier to develop, and nobody solved the problems with them.

I get 700km+ in the city, aircon max, with passengers. When I drive out to the country, again, with passengers and cargo, using the aircon, 320-ish kilometres doesn’t cut it. Even if my car gave me such meagre milage, it wouldn’t be as big an issue, because I don’t have to pull over for a half hour coffee time for every extra 150 kilometres. It’s a non-comparison. EVs are currently better suited to those who commute regular short distances. But cases like that warrant better investment in public transport, amenity, and planning. So every $7000 the US federal government splurges on a Model S is $7000 dollars that could have spent on the public, you know, where public money belongs.\n\nCan you please show me where it’s said the Audi has to learn the route? The system on the Audi is virtually identical to the Tesla in what it achieves. You put it on the freeway, it’ll maintain a lane, distance etc. and change lanes when prompted by the indicator.\n\nNo it’s not ‘actually a space rocket’, aluminium is great but it’s not some crazy new thing. I haven’t seen any evidence it’s the safest car on the market. A quick Google has shown me a number of European and Japanese cars, without any EVs rating a mention. Granted I didn’t look deeply into it but if it’s as outrageous as you claim, I’m sure there’d be plenty of material. Plenty of cars will drive off after a minor accident. So will Teslas. Plenty of cars won’t drive off after a major accident. Neither will Teslas. I’m sorry but there’s no magic sauce. They’re impressive, but so are many other cars.\n\nUS electricity production was 67% fossil fuels in 2014. Wind and solar aren’t making this big dent yet that everyone’s getting all moist about, and it’s largely to do with what I’ve talked about, that solar doesn’t provide when demand is high. The amount of power lost during transmission is embarrassing for humanity, which is another factor which balances the arguments about losses in refining and transporting oil. We spend enormous amounts of energy in transport and through the grid. Shifting this from two of those sources to one will be a strain on costs for much of the world, especially as much of it is much more fossil dependant than the US. Until EVs and their energy sources become competitive, people, especially the poor and developing, will continue to use the cheaper alternative.\n\nOdd that you’re totally okay with powering a car by burning natural gas, transmitting the power inefficiently to your battery which is extremely energy intensive to produce, and then using it, but you complain about the particulants of biogas which is better than natural gas as it's pure methane whereas natural gas contains additional contaminants. Natural gas and biogas are chemically the same, bar contaminants, artificial odours etc. Smells like bias to me. Alternatively, if you’re so chill with natural gas, why not run a car on it? Many in my country do.\n\nThe source of my friend's gas doesn't impact food production. A while back Sweden regulated how farmers can fertilise their land with cow manure, as it was causing algal blooms in the Baltic. Left not sure what to do with it all, businesses were clever and started making this gas. Farm land isn't impacted by its production, it gives farmers an extra source of income and makes use of what would otherwise damage the environment. She can now use her car for about the same cost as petrol, and it's pretty close to carbon neutral.\n\nIt’s a great interim solution, as your car doesn’t know any difference between NG and biogas. We produce a fucktonne of both waste and natural gas. Why not capture as much of that as possible, power most cars more cleanly on a combination of the two until EVs catch up. The infrastructure is there, we already produce millions upon millions of cars capable of running on it, so much for small scale.\n\nIt’s interesting to think though, if we did, the upward pressure on the market would probably make electricity prohibitively expensive to warrant EVs if we want to reduce emissions short term, for which there is no economically viable alternative than to shift from coal to NG. Because running a car on NG which is efficiently piped around to where it can be burnt, is more effective than burning it, transmitting the power wastefully and then charging a god awful battery. Also NG likes a particular amount of air. It’s not like coal. So all this about ‘large scale power companies can do it more efficiently’ is fairly moot.\n\nNow I say this knowing that one day, electric cars will be the way, and they’ll be clean and efficient. But at present, they are none of those things for the overwhelming majority of people in the world. It’s ridiculous when suggested those in developing countries shouldn’t be entitled to burn petrol meanwhile others run their electric cars on coal, gas etc. to no better end, just as polluting-ly. Right now, convincing ourselves or spreading mistruths that the emissions of EVs are anything other than identical to combustion vehicles isn’t protecting the environment. Carbon trading schemes give a good indication of just how little difference EVs make. I know we need to buy them for them to develop to the stage we need to begin with, and I don’t discourage anyone from buying one. I don’t dislike Teslas (I like them a lot) or any other EV on the basis of being an EV. I’m just not into the misinformation surrounding them. That is my point here. Users suffer a bad case of the 'if I can't see its effects, they don't exist!'. Acknowledging the reality that EVs are just as dirty is the first step to making them not so.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Bannicus"}

That's a fact, most nuclear bombs use it. China even achieved it for half an hour at temperatures higher than the sun. The issue is not fusion itself, it's generating more energy than you use, and doing so in a reliable and regular manner.\n\n\nAn Isotope is literally just an element that has a different number of neutrons (particles in an atom without charge). A element is decided by the number of protons in the core.\n\n\nIf it has more neutrons it becomes unstable, which is useful for nuclear power, both fission and fusion.\n\n\nWe have created ridiculously high temperatures in very small concentrations, think 1 gram or less. In fusion they avoid damaging the materials by using magnets which can affect charged particles like plasma. However neutrons which have no charge aren't affected by charge, and thus are fired at the surrounding chamber, so they can't keep things running forever and have to use materials like titanium to absorb them without damaging any electronics. The real issue is long term, since you have to replace lots of parts.\n\n\nHuman civilizations have been destroyed countless times, however at the moment we suffer none of the problems that caused these collapses. No famine, no plague, no mass slavery(unless you count tyranny and debt), are able to collapse our civilisation in the same way previous civilisations have.\n\n\nThat said, there are so many ways for civilisation to collapse in the future, that it will take a lot of luck, and hard work for humanity to endure the future.\n\n\nHave you heard of metamaterials, everyday we are discovering new things about matter and physics, that are allowing us to use technology in new ways. I don't know of any new technologies, however nuclear thorium salt reactors is suprisingly useful and uses only waste material which would get rid of nuclear waste.

The US should invest way more in renewable energy. Second of all, electric cars and batteries are still in active development, which means they will get better and better. We will probably find some element in the (near) future that can replace Lithium and is way better. And we will find better ways and materials to create cars from which will make sure we don't need as much energy.\n\nEverything that is being developed now for electric cars is an investment in the future, people seem to forget that.

You do have that right. But I refuse to believe that there is any moral equivalency between Humans and Animals, which is what I was trying to say. These are animals that have no concepts of morals or consciousness. I have worked with these animals before: cows, chickens, pigs, they are not very intelligent. Even when compared to dogs and cats they fall short. Not to mention that their relationship with us is far more symbiotic than parasitic. We raise them, make sure they are in good health, feed them nutritious food (well, some of us) and ensure that the strongest among them breed, and in exchange they give us meat and milk/eggs/bruises on the legs.\n\n\nI also completely disagree that we have much of a choice in the matter. Humans are rather well built for eating meat. We can eat anything, but should we? I think a balanced diet is much healthier than a vegetarian one. Look up Lierre Kieth. She has done excellent work on researching anti-nutrients and the effect of vegetarian diets. This is of course not to say that everyone should eat meat, but vegetarianism isn't for every body, especially when you factor in celiac disease and other dietary problems relating to gluten. When grain goes out the window, the next highest density of energy in food is meat. Everything else is either harder to digest (vegetables), way too sugary for our good (fruits and other sugary foods), or prone to allergies (nuts and beans).\n\n\n\nI have to say you're right about the video.

I am assuming you are American, and I am afraid you are confusing things here. I can show you studies of sportsmen who ingest plenty of animal protein and are by far the healthiest people on the planet with the lowest incidence of Diabetes, hyperlipidemia and cardiomyopathies. Saying that Vegetarians have a healthier diet in America, doesn't mean much really. The problem is that Americans have horrible eating habits. Eating meat everyday, especially processed meat, is not healthy at all. Not to mention the incredible amount of steroids and chemicals used in American meat and diary products. In other countries milk goes spoils in three days. In American in can last almost two weeks. Sure eating too much meat is harmful, and will obviously increase the risk of the diseases mentioned above. But from there to demonize all meat nourishment is long stretch. There such a thing as eating too little meat. Just an example, I had a patient who was vegetarian, we convince her that eating meat would be beneficial. She had iron deficiency levels. She saw it was ok to eat meat once on awhile. But that is the key, eating meat is good. A lack iron, cobalamin, carnisone, Ω3, among many others, can lead to a lot of health problems. These are nutritional sources that can be easily found in meat products, and in the cast of the latter two almost exclusively in meat products. You can have some supplements, albeit for some not all, but they will never match obtaining them from meat products. We are omnivore animals, we need these nutrients. (BTW I can recognize a vegetarian miles away by just looking at the color of their hair) Now, we have to be very careful, this means you can eat meat up to three times a week to make the nutrients enough for your body to work with. If you are one of the many Americans who eat bacon, beef, ham, pork, and chicken (most of them as heavily processed) three times a day, then yeah vegan diet will look like a miracle from heaven. The problem there is that you are eating too much, and in most cases a lot of that is not even meat, buy dyes, steroids and chemicals. My advice would be to have a healthy diet. For Americans, try to buy organic meat and organic vegetables (which in the rest of the world are normal meat and vegetables) and try to vary the income of the things you eat. Much better than risking your health.  ", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Revert Revertz"}

Do you think Obese people get fat because they eat too much vegetables? No, because they eat too much fast food and they wont stop eating fast food which normslly contains meat.\n\nBefore everyone thinks this is a great idea, going vegan=No fish, no pizza, no sushi, no burgers, no barbecues!! like do you think people will give this up that easily?

Although I would not approve of the extermination of any animal species, clearly this has a zero effect.  Myth 2. \"Land that is used for ranching could be used for growing vegetables and grain.\" Not true... Farming vegetables and grain is, and always has been, more profitable. Raising livestock is mostly done on land that is not suitable for cultivating. Poor soil, thin top soil, scattered bed rock, high altitude, too hot , too dry etc etc Trust me! If they could grow soybeans, they would. Myth 3. \"Land that is good for cultivating is used for growing animal feed.\" Also not true. Most animal feed largely consists of food byproducts from human food. Everything from coffee bean shells to the left over barley from beer brewers gets used. There is, however, farmland that's use is wasted for making ethanol. Of course there are many more unspoken truths about this subject matter that you won't find in the media.

It seems preferable to have cultured the grasslands to manage vast populations of meat animals (i.e. cattle and/or bison) to optimize the production of high quality grass fed meat (and dairy) for human consumption. It seems absurd to feed grains to cattle not adapted for this feed, and to produce grains so inefficiently (and destructively) to boot. Somehow, feeding the same grains to people (as vegans) doesn't seem much better. Perhaps it is preferable from an energy balance perspective, but the problem seems more complicated than a simple heat engine.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "cheezerj 30"}

You see the quality of land has a huge impact on what is farmed, and the quality of land can vary greatly over even short distances. One can unquestionably say that not all land designated for farming is suitable for crop farming, far from. Take for instance the UK, 80% of farmland in Wales and 84% of farmland in Scotland is classed as 'less favoured areas' (lower quality soil, soil lacking certain properties and/or higher altitudes make these lands inadequate for crop farming) Using such land for crop farming would essentially be a waste of time and resources, i very much doubt even the most talented farmers could eek a living from growing crops in such conditions, and he or she certainly would't have much to show for it in terms of food on our plates. Crop farming in the UK is essentially centred around eastern and southern England, these are areas of low-lying land packed with quality. Farming generally balances itself out, crop farming centres around high quality soil localities, and livestock farming around land not suitable for any other farming. Your prediction of an almost totally vegan world is quite farcical to me.. Did it not occur to you that there are upper limits to where the crops you love to eat would grow? Altitude? Soil quality? Did you think you could just start growing crops on all land used for livestock currently? This is the consumer mind set.. don't care how, don't care where from.. as long as its on my plate is all that matters. \n\nI will say this.. I'm not sure we need so many burgers in this world (McDonalds) i'm looking at you.

The amount of nutrients in meat heavily outweighs that of vegetables. The amount of vegetables that we would need to consume in order to survive would mean the amount of land needed for farming would leave little room for living space. The amount of energy that would be needed to process these foods for consumption far exceeds the amount needed to process meats. This is just another false ideology, just like climate change, propagated by those in high places to get us to believe that the Earth is overpopulated and measures need to be taken to keep the population down. If everyone fell for the vegan propaganda and became a vegan and they stopped farming animals and started only farming vegetables, the amount of land for farming needed to feed everyone would further push the idea that there are too many people on Earth and the population needs to be drastically reduced... People have to start thinking for themselves and stop believing what you are told. Everything we are taught in school and on told on tv are lies. For some reason, the \"elite\" of this world want more of it to themselves and are constantly creating lie after lie to get us to kill ourselves off.

When you factor in the real costs of solar panels and how they force you to use them, it takes 30 years to pay them off and the best solar panels on the planet will only last 25 to 30 years.  The vast majority of solar panels give out at the 15 to 18 year mark.\n\nFirst and foremost solar panels have subsidies.  This is a way of faking the true cost of a solar panel.  Remove the subsidies and solar becomes far too expensive to have.\n\nSecondly, you are forced to tie your solar panels into the grid where the government pays you pennies on the dollar for your electricity and then they sell it back to you at full price.  Thus reducing the time it takes for you to recoup your money.\n\nI realize that you can simply just vomit out whatever emotion that is in your stupid head, but that isn't a valid form of argumentation.\n\nA simple google search on \"average lifespan of solar panels\" as well as \"solar panel subsidies\" as well as \"solar panels return on investment calculator\"  will show you that if you live in Arizona it will save you about $13,000 in energy over the lifetime of the solar panels which is 20 years.  It will cost about $30,000 if you subtract out the subsidies.\n\nSolar panels degrade about 1% efficiency per year.

{"cid": "UgjrcYv4oiNRQngCoAEC", "text": "There are two ways electric cars could be actually environment-friendly, because there are only two worthy sources of green energy.\n\nThe first one is hydroelectric power. It is cheaper than coal, and 100% green, except when it comes to the need for a dam, that can cause considerable (and often kills beautiful landscapes), but easily mitigated damages. A few years ago Brazil's energy source was 80% hydroelectric (now just over 70% due to a drought since 2012), and it could be 100% if more plants were built. Sadly, most countries don't have enough water sources to do the same. The Southern and Northen American countries generally could do it to some extent.\n\nThe second option is available for every country. NUCLEAR ENERGY! It's green, it makes a lot of energy, it doesn't need rivers, it's great! The cons are the production of waste and the fearmongering of people afraid of an explosion. Accidents can be pretty devastating, that is why we need to work on this source to make it even safer, and, if possible, put it away from places in danger of natural disasters.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Mr Doctor Professor Patrick"}

{"cid": "UgiNP4bvhyRfpXgCoAEC", "text": "A few points were missed for the entire reason for electric vehicles, and I'll try my best to hit each one.\n\n1. Giving incentives for the population to move toward electric vehicles will raise demand in that area.  Demand for it will also help research and development teams create better designs of efficiency.  Gasoline vehicle have hit a brick wall, they mass produce ICEs like there's no tomorrow without worrying about efficiency....want a V8 when you live in a flat state and you only drive 5 minutes to work? No problem, here you go!  At least with electric vehicles, we've improved to the point where it now rivals gasoline, and hopefully one day we will beat it in drive length.\n\n2. Placing a single 1 m^2 size solar panel replacement for the roof can capture roughly 0.75 kWh on average day (this is the low end scale, there are more efficient models).  The Tesla Model S (for example) has a 300 mile range on an 85 kWh battery, which seems like that solar panel isn't going to do much for you....but I live 4 miles from where I work, so I use only 1.13 kW of power one-way, which is recharged in 1.5 hours.  Even if we skimp on efficiency (or even if I got the numbers wrong), I work for 8 hours, that car is definitely charged.  Maybe this doesn't go for everyone, but I would wager that the majority of adults live close enough to their job.\n\n3. Even if cars are charged by majority of coal power plants, the government has started a reduction regulation on CO2 emissions from industrial/power plants....which means even if the demand for electric goes up from more electric vehicles on the roads, the emissions from the plants still have to be reduced by law.  There is a growing opportunity for algae farms to siphon some of the CO2 out of plants which create biomass used for fertilizer, oils, etc.  We cannot expect to put these farms on every vehicle in the country, so why not combine all the emissions into a single location that can harness that power specifically?  With more demand in this, we can also raise efficiency here as well.\n\n4. I will concede at this point to the actual manufacturing of the vehicle itself....many deadly chemicals are created and used.  However, as my first point states, efficiency is found through research and development, simply changing the batteries into a capacitor bank can save on lithium production, reduce cost, and performs similar to a normal battery (other than a high natural drain, but that can be offset by a solar panel, go figure).\n\nIf we are to continue as a species, we have to look to what we can do now to stop killing the planet....-5 tons is still better than doing nothing.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Robert Caldwell"}

I would argue that the main reason for this low adoption is the lobbying from organisations such as the Copenhagen consensus center made possible by the obscene amount of wealth that fossil fuel interests have concentrated over the past century.

If the batteries become much cleaner, the cars will, too.\n\nThe only problem remaining is that electricity is largely generated via burning of fossil fuels, which does not have anything to do with electric cars whatsoever. One way or another, both cars are currently powered by fossil fuel, but one of them has room for improvement. I'd rather start low with a lot of room to improve, than stay at the same mediocre level forever.

Your vehicle’s Battery is covered under this Battery Limited Warranty for a period of 8 years or for the number of miles/km specified below for your Battery configuration,\nwhichever comes first:*\n\n• 60 kWh - 125,000 miles (200,000 km)\n• 85 kWh - unlimited miles/km\n\nAs you can see, they expect it to last a lot longer than 90,000 miles. Also, the low end estimate for the motors, is about 400,000 miles or so. If we also look at the Tesla battery cycle lifetime, of 3,000 before you have 70% charge, even at an average of 200 miles per charge, you have 600,000 miles.\n\n- It says that 65% of the energy in the US is not produced by sustainable energy like wind and solar, therefore it is coal. This is patently false, coal has not not produced that high a percentage for decades, and this completely ignores nuclear which is very clean, discounting nuclear waste.\n\n- It also claims that this will only increase by a few percent. Again, by 2040 nuclear fusion could be achievable, battery technology will be better thanks to Tesla energy, and solar and wind will be better and more viable. More and more people are able to buy solar panels for housing as well, also if coal is replaced with gas stations, less CO2 will be produced.\n\n- It claims that Lithium mining is bad. Actually, lithium isn't that worse than coal or oil production, and is done at such a low scale it has little effect, you might say that it will need to be up scaled, but that's not accurate since lithium ion batteries can be 100% recycled.\n\n- It claims that electric cars take more energy to produce and release more CO2 in production. This is either becuase they compared a smaller car to a Tesla, in which case of course the larger more expensive car takes more energy and emissions to build, or they accounted for the battery, which does release CO2 in mining, however, if you replace the transport and equipment in mining with solar energy, and heavily involve recycling of lithium, ignoring batteries that use less or even no lithium the emissions are offset.\n\n- It also claims that electric cars will still release more CO2 if they use coal. Electric cars use electromagnetic brakes to recover kinetic energy, they are much more efficient than petrol cars which lose energy through heat and through many more moving parts. Even on coal, a group calculated an electric car has the equivalent of 54 mpg.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "CMDR Dantae"}

That means the car with one passenger, driving on level ground, 72 degrees outside, middle of the day, etc.    The thing is that gas cars naturally are closer to this \"perfect condition\" than electric cars. Hypothetically, let's assume it's -10 degrees outside. In a gas car you turn it on, and turn on your heater. Yes, there is some drag from belts, but it is negligible (you actually gain some efficiency from the cold as well from slightly higher oxygen content). In an electric car the battery efficiency drops like a rock. In addition, instead of heating the car with waste heat like a gas car, an electric car must use an electric heater. According the manufacturers' own reports the heater uses MORE power than actually driving the car.    Now imagine driving at night with headlights on, and the radio turned up, charging a cell phone, seat heater on, and all the other electric devices people use.   The same is also true for extreme heat. Hot summer temperatures will KILL batteries' life expectancy with prolonged exposure, sometimes by up to 60%. Gas engines, not so much.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "cuda1179"}

Also, electric cars actually do better in higher temperatures, they are meant for places with solar panels anyway, so that's a win win. Are electric cars having problems in cold areas, yes, they can get covered in ice in the snow, and you don't want water in electronics, however, they will find solutions to that over the years, and its still better than petrol. Coal use is decreasing in favour of gas, nuclear and renewables, which makes EVs, far better than any ICE car when it comes to emissions.\n\nAlso, the new lithium oxygen battery, would actually gain efficiency in the cold, due to the oxygen content, and bridge the gap between ICE and EV at sub zero. Also, no, the heater doesn't use more power, users report only a 30% reduction in range in cold weather, if you added proper insulation, that could be cut in half. Once EV battery technology has improved for a few years, this won't be an issue unless you don't have a garage to prevent your car from freezing. Battery tech according to Tesla could already give them cars with 400 - 500 mile ranges, but they have an issue with price, batteries are expensive, once tech improves, and price drops, batteries could have better range than petrol cars. They are more efficient after all, with less moving parts, heat and energy saving features like aerodynamics and a magnetic brake to save kinetic energy.\n\nNo, hot summer doesn't actually reduce range, apparently it improves it massively.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "CMDR Dantae"}

Although this does help damper the drain on the battery it does lead to a less than ideal environment in the cabin. Just another thing to put-up with in an electric car. Gas engines do produce 20% more emissions in real life than in tests, however electric vehicles also show a significantly higher rate of energy use in real-world application.   As for hot weather, I wasn't talking about short-term energy returns with a single charge. I was talking about long-term life expectancy. Consistent use in hot weather will limit a battery's ability to take a charge.

Over 17,000km in a year emits 2,000kg of CO2. Over the lifetime of an electric car, the USC says an EV can save 53% in emissions, this includes recycling with is a negligible percentage. That's on current US grid, lets remember. Which has a more polluting grid. Car fleet too, but in reality, your average 24mpg isn't very far from out from the real, average economy of 30 - 40mpg here when units are converted.\n\n\nEven over here when we forget what the sun looks like, the like of a 2-panel array can provide up to 30,000kWh per year.

There is no doubt that the Earth's climate is constantly changing, often dramatically (think Ice Age).  The question is whether that's completely natural, whether man has a negligible impact on it, or whether man is capable of having a catastrophic impact on climate.  Our understanding of climate is in its infancy, and we have NO computer models that even come close to working accurately yet (ask any scientist and they will verify this).  The \"catastrophic\" models are almost entirely guesswork, and rely on feedback loops that we don't know exist.  They also rely on fudging the data to generate stronger reactions from the climate than our research can justify.  In short, I agree that man may have a minimal impact on climate, but there is no evidence that we can impact climate catastrophically.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is flat-out lying and/or completely overstepping the actual knowledge we have.  The question then becomes whether trading a minimal, non-catastrophic climate impact for useful energy is worth it.  Developing nations (who are reliant on more primitive forms of power) are the hardest hit by global regulations.  The world economy is hit by regulations.  Jobs are lost, wealth is destroyed, and the government extends its control while it crushes individual freedoms -- as we march ever onward toward greater and greater degrees of totalitarianism.  To me, it's NOT worth it.  There is NO evidence that \"catastrophic man-made climate change\" is a real thing.  If you'd like an entertaining and enlightening read, I'd recommend Michael Crichton's \"State of Fear,\" which illustrates how the government uses fear and the crisis mentality to get us to voluntarily give up our freedoms.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "RandomNumber"}

They did the research for real, finding that of all the research papers, only .3% of them, yes, 99.7% of scientists did not claim that man was responsible for global warming, only .3% claimed man had done this to us. So they tried other studies, manipulating the data again, all of it crap and it turns out that the only people who believe that hoax anymore are the ones making the big paychecks to support the political agenda.

The IPCC has been manipulating data for years, ever since they concocted this hoax back in the 1990s. Why is it that the raw data shows no change, nothing as far back as they can go? Why is it that in all of northern Canada, there used to be 150 temperature stations, but now there is only one. The IPCC NWO, globalists shut the rest down because they showed a cooling earth, so more manipulation of the data! Climategates 1, 2, and 3 all show the same thing, mass manipulation of data, there is no warming! If you aren't aware of that, then go dig another hole in the sand and bury your head.

What about Great Britain’s Windscale reactor and what about Chernobyl in the Ukraine?  We still don’t know how many were killed there.  Measuring instruments continue to fail at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant were they need to use robots to continue the dismantling of the facility (5 years later).\nYou asked me for one name.  I hope that you receive this information in the spirit that I have presented it for the genuine concern about a very real tragedy that can beset us so easily and quickly and so many won’t even live to regret it, while many others will suffer horribly for the rest of their lives.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "53wamo"}

No, there is still plenty of unused electricity, more electric cars would not mean more coal plants which are many times more efficient than a car engine, it would have no effect, and reduce wasted energy since so few people have electric cars anyway. Obama's administration predictions are irrelevant, solar and wind technology are improving fast, not to mention Fusion will be available by 2040. More and more people want to take action against climate change, especially in the younger generation. \n\nThe manufacture of electric cars produces similiar co2 to petrol cars, in fact since the engine is made of lots of metal, and is very big, the petrol car is worse in that aspect. Lithium production sure has problems, but they are limited and it can be recycled. Petrol cars are extremely inefficient and lose energy through heat and sound. Even electric vehicles running on coal powered electricity have the equivalent of about 54 mpg, which is very efficient compared to petrol cars. Also, more and more electricity is being produced from low emission gas stations and renewable energy like wind and solar.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "CMDR Dantae"}

We have seen evidence of a correlation between CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and periods of warmer weather on earth. But is it warmer because there's more CO2 or is there more CO2 because it's warmer? Or is there no true causation at all and it's just an interesting correlation that we're observing. The truth is we don't know. The Earth has gone through many cycles of heating and cooling without man's interference and we honestly don't know what is causing it today.\n\nIn modern times we have a unprecedented variable of man made CO2 emissions. Yes CO2 levels are higher now than they have been in the past 5 million years, however they're still lower than they ever were before that. In addition, the average temperature of the planet right now is lower than most previous geologic periods of the planet except the ice ages and the \"snowball earth\" periods.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Nathan L"}

I live here and in terms of energy, we have no nuclear power plants (eventhough we are the worlds largest exporter of uranium) and very few cities and private homes that have converted to using solar power (even though australia invented solar panels!). so our energy actually comes from huge stores of brown coal (lignite) which is actually the worst kind of coal interms of co2 emission, but interestingly enough this might be why there is such a geothermic shift in our rural enviroment while also enriching organic matter in soil which is quite commonly known", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "green lamp"}

You're asking us to believe that's a coincidence, and that some other natural process started this trend right around the industrial revolution? And that our known emissions are smaller than we think or something, so they don't contribute? I don't get why people resist the idea that we caused this.
