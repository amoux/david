(even though i love all races each is special and awesome depends on person not colorüòò) Out of all races isnt it a little racist or at least generalizing if you automatically assume its a black person? They might be totally innocent and it could be another race but yet you are attacking one race out of tons and assuming you are right. That isnt right on you're part especially since you're mad the person said \"i hate white people\" when you are spreading hate about another race without even knowing facts.

Yes black people are very known for being the most racist people in the country. Mostly because they can get away with it the easiest. They can kidnap and straight up torture white people just for being white and livestream it and it will get almost no media attention. So yes they are usually the ones saying racist things toward white people. Why is that you ask? Because it‚Äôs easy for them to fight every argument with ‚Äúwe were oppressed 100 years ago‚Äù. It was literally your natural instinct to do it in your comment as well. But that‚Äôs not my point. If you want to self victimize at all times that‚Äôs fine. I mean it won‚Äôt help you succeed in life but I can‚Äôt stop you. Never the less I never said it was a black person tweeting them. I just said imagine if the tweet was about black people.

Btw, Slavery and ethnic prejudice has been part of the human life since the dawn of humanity and it has evolutionary roots. 2. Your logic is severely flawed . Racism is defined as \"Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race so as to distinguish him/her as inferior.\" Thus:  \"Discrimination against people based on race\" = Racism. So when you say \"you can discriminate against white people sure\" you technically say that it is racism. The fact that a group of people has or has not been discriminated against \"Previously\" on a \"Grand Scale\" has absolutely nothing to do with it. If you are discriminating against a certain group of people solely based on their ethnicity \"Today\" you are \"Racist\". Period.  It is rather a cheap and ridiculous justification to say you are not just because no body else have ever oppressed them \"on a grand scale\" before!!! By your flawed logic, We can't be \"racist\" against many of the ethnicities around the world. For instance, we need to dig in history to find instances of systematic racism \"on a grand scale\" against me as a Persian. We have rather been colonizers in history and been colonized too. However, I reckon you would not hesitate to extend your definition of \"racism\" to me because you see me as a \"non-white\" (though technically I am a Caucasian). But you try so hard to avoid calling out the very obvious racist remarks towards these people \"Only\" because of their white skin colour which is ,in fact, the very definition of \"Racism\".", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Mitra Shokrollahi"}

At the end of the day, actors are people who are just doing what everyone else is doing ---- their job.

You can't deny this. You have to take this into account when you talk about equality. The more power you have over a person or group the more responsibility you have.  Your boss hitting on you is not the same as you doing it in reverse. He has the power to fire you. A man hitting a woman typically has more physical strength and there for we do not except man hitting women. Not a double standard. I am talking about the abuse of power. All of it is wrong.

I'm not going to debate that point though. I just wanted to point out in your statement about men hitting women and vice versa, that they are both equally as bad as far as I am concerned. And I understand where you're coming from, in that if a man punches a woman he will typically do more damage than a woman who punches a man. However, a lot of women dont use simple punches to attack a man unless they really know how to punch well. Usually when I've seen a woman attack a man first, they kick full force to the nuts and keep kicking while they pull hair and claw for the eyes. I've seen a 100lb. woman who attacked a man first, put him in the hospital with a ruptured testicle and a severe cornea laceration. Sure, if he would have punched her first  he would put her in the hospital with a broken jaw. Sounds pretty  equal to me. It's just old fashioned gender stereotypes that push the idea that women cant damage men as bad in a fight, so it's obviously worse for a man to hit a woman. We all know in this day and age that women are considered to be equal to men on every level so an attack by one on the other should be thought of as exactly the same thing. If the adage of women being equal to men is considered by society to be universally true then that would mean that a woman is not an underprivileged minority compared to a man and should receive no special status vs. a man, based on just gender alone. If you say that adage isn't true then you just triggered every feminist around the world who says that women are equal to or better than men in every way. But, no one can have their cake and eat it to, so which is it? Are women equal to men in every way or are they not and somehow inferior to us in some way, shape or form and deserving of some special status to help even things out? I'm not asking you to pick one. I'm asking society to pick one or the other and settle the debate instead of flip flopping between both answers whenever it suits societie's, an individual's, or group's need to do so. Also if you're boss  hits you, you call the cops he goes to jail and he usually loses his job and power . If you hit him,he calls the cops and you go to jail. You lose your job and go to jail just like he would if he hit you. A CEO or president is no better than anyone else in the eyes of the law.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Bad Bishop"}

The default is human, every human should be treated equal, fair and just.

There is no double standard or having it both ways. Men and woman are equal in every way but physical. I am sure someone will be able to even argue with that.

Remember, above all their celebrity status, they are still human. I read somewhere in the comments where someone said that Hiddleston's face should be hit with a brick multiple times. Would it be nice, if I rammed a brick at your face? No. What if everyone around you called you ugly just because they disliked you. Would you like it? No. In my opinion, nobody in the world is ugly, we just lable something as ugly if we don't like it. Change that character of yours first, then talk about others.

First of all, i have never read a buzzfeed article lmao and even for all your knowledge of history your ignorance knows no bounds. To understand and especially to speak about racism, you need to understand race. You don't. Racism has not existed in many nations across the globe throughout centuries because racism, the term, didn't exist then. There were no races, simple ethnic backgrounds, where you were born. Plenty of those people were the same color or differed, but they weren't worried about that at all, they simply hated eachother for having different rulers, laws, or even technology. Racism LITERALLY didn't exist before because there were no races before, white americans created that line. That is a very recent social construct. How about you pick up a history book sometime?\n\nAlthough races are generally black, white and asian with latino moving between black and white due to white americans' needs at the time and are generally on the white side nowdays simply because they got to choose, people now consider race synonymous with ethnic backgrounds. As in they'd call black people black and white people white, yet with asians it will be indians, koreans, chinese, japanese, etc. The largest issue with race is there are no predefined boundaries because its literally based on skin color, but white people were never consistent with that. They made asians and latinos black or white depending on what they wanted them to serve as, labor workers or dividers between african americans. But those who could pass for white, even african americans, could manage to pass by these rules. \n\nWhat is racism? It's black and white bathrooms. It's not black, white, japanese, mexican, russian bathrooms. It's not christian, jewish, buddhist, islamic bathrooms. It's skin color and nothing more, which was never a problem until white people specifically. I don't think only white people can be racist. But they are the only ones capable of racist acts, from not only history but from the definition and context of racism. And for you to call me racist for believing that shows just how little you know about the term. If a black slave were to hate the white race, would you call that racism? Do you think they feel superiority? If so, you're beyond clueless. If not, then comprehend that further. If black people feel bitter towards white people, what makes you associate that with superiority as a race when you know the relationship between black and whites? People who develop hatred for their captors don't base it on a superiority complex, that makes no sense. If they truly felt superior they wouldn't care enough to hate them. But from that ill repeat that the statement in the video is a racist comment. But whether the person is racist or not, idk. A racist comment from a white person has the background of racism and white superiority for centuries. A racist comment from a black person has the background of racism and white superiority for centuries as well. So you can see why one is more suspicious over the other.", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "The Balloon Jin Lets Go In BST"}

{"cid": "UgwpGo5GJVN3DNry7D54AaABAg.8hpRuravR-Z8jof2jue-zQ", "text": "Andrew, actually white European culture got rid of slavery, well at least in it's political sphere.   The whole world practiced slavery and the word slave was derived from the word slav, which was the Slavic people's of Europe (eastern)  which today would constitute Czech's Pole's and Slovaks.   So people of white heritage, so yes all peoples at one time were slaves, it's not a racial issue.   In fact it was a economic issue, people with money bought slaves worked them to death and bought more to make profit for themselves.   If you look at slavery in the west though slaves were treated like property and were fed, housed and taken care of better than in a lot of other places.  Even back then there was more value placed on human lives than in other cultures.  \n\n       It's why i think eventually English gov't started paying slave owners for their slaves, set them free  and banned slavery all together.   USA also banned it along with most European cultures far before other cultures did.   Keep in mind also that been a economic issue as well as a social issue, people with money lobbied gov'ts to enforce slavery laws on their behalf.   Sound familiar?   Corporations (which are a gov't created entity with rights above average individuals) lobbying gov'ts for their interests.   \n\n      However you will never be taught the dangers of gov't in schools that are funded by gov't, it would be like Coke running a school and teaching you the dangers of sugar.   Hence in today's schools the narrative is white oppression and the patriarch.  This serves to undermine our culture create guilt and have us fund corporate / gov't  interests.\n\n         This narrative also helps the corporations in my opinion.   You have the corporate military industrial complex paid by tax payers destroying other cultures/ countries  around the world and then institutions like the UN and EU demanding countries take in refugee's. These institutions are directly linked to groups like the Council of Foreign Relations and many of our gov't officials have served on their boards.     White shame is then used to extort the west's money to populate their countries with more people which may also result in conflicting cultural value systems.   Now corporations have more cheap labor at hand and gov'ts to a certain extent have more cattle to tax and don't forget who the gov't works for.....people who lobby them, not you the tax payer.   The corporations will also have more people to buy their products.  This influx of immigration however is payed for by tax payer money.\n\n      You see it's not about races VS race and how whites are opressor's.   It's about money and consumerism.   Don't get me wrong i am all for business, i would rather deal with people in a business situation than with a gov't agent who won't think twice about throwing me in jail if i don't give him money.   It's when you mix ultimate power (gov't) with billionaires, they end up creating large institutions that run society between the two of them and the rights of individuals are secondary to these institutions.   The irony of it is, the answer to this problem is a gov't that has VERY limited powers and a strong free competitive market place.  You just have to understand that gov't will always become corrupt just as no business person is above corruption either.   Corruption in the market place however can deal a swift blow however, your sales can tank fast.  \n\n       I will stop there, you probably stopped reading few paragraphs ago lol.  Oh one more thing, as cultural differences get worse gov't will have to enact new laws / poower's to themselves to fix the tensions between clashing cultural value systems.   If you noticed both gov't and corporations are acting in tandem and are putting in place laws like hate speech and in some countries compelled speech, a lot of censorship is taking place in both corporate arena's and govt.   It's why i hate the narrative you stated above as it's divisive untrue and hurts individual rights and helps the corporately run fascist gov't.   That is one aspect of fascism btw, corporations merging with gov't to run society.   \n\n       So don't be used my friend for others political and financial gains, we need to learn how to critically think.......not that i am great at it but i have taken a journey because my society was no longer making sense in what they were saying.   Also by no means am i correct on all my assertions, after all how can i know the inner thoughts and motives of corporations and gov't.   If you follow the money though that is generally what is happening, in fact natives in the west have less access to tax payer funded services than minorities and refugee's............hell in Canada my aunt was told that to her face lol.

It‚Äôs not even racist because it is designated to just a skin color and not even a race of people. I think most people these days are actually so ignorant, stereotypical, ‚Äúracist‚Äù,  and rude. I think all types of humor definitely have a place. But I know in America that that tweet wouldn‚Äôt have been shown if it was about a different skin color, which is stereotypical and hateful. I use quotes to imply that racism is actually something else entirely, but is now very watered down and misconstrued to allow ignorant and entitled people to make false claims that can‚Äôt be argued with logic because they are not based in logic. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm sorry if you were just trying to look at potentially funny comments. I don‚Äôt mean to ruin anyone‚Äôs day. And I‚Äôm willing to discuss what I just previously stated if they wish to respond and I see the response. And to clarify the only things I said negatively were about people who are rude, stereotypical, and stupid. But I‚Äôm sure this comment will have arguments. \nAnd people if you think you actually experience hate and racism then you are grossly discrediting people who were literally murdered in millions and or enslaved by others simply on their race. But most people decide that because they share some common trait with someone who was once subjugated for their race and treated awfully, that they are entitled to some compensations or different treatment, which is again, ‚Äúracist‚Äù... damn I need to just go to sleep", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "WTH13SERIOUSLY"}

In fact, humans as we know them have only existed for about 0.0000005% of the time the universe has existed. Now, in regards to your racist hypocratic comment, yes, you can in fact be racist to white people. And yea, you're right, white people have been racist to pretty much every race, including their own, throughout history. What you're forgetting (or never knew) is that throughout history literally EVERY other race has also been racist to literally EVERY other race. Just because white people enslaved black people in the United States doesn't mean they were the only slave owners throughout history. White people have actually, historically, been enslaved significantly more than black people.\n\nYou can't use history to make excuses for racism. Racism is bad period, no matter what race it's against, including whites. Saying it's ok to be racist to white people because they've been racist in the past is like saying all people who have descended from Nazis should be slaughtered in a genocide because their ancestors did it to Jews.

This is due to the concept of ‚Äúprivileged vs. underprivileged.‚Äù It‚Äôs acceptable for the underprivileged to make jokes about the privileged but not the other way around.\n\nHere is an example. Let‚Äôs talk about short guys vs tall guys. If you‚Äôre a short guy, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage versus tall guys because we all know that tall guys tend to have more success with women and tall guys command more power in a room. So in this scenario, short guys are the ‚Äúunderprivileged‚Äù and tall guys are the ‚Äúprivileged.‚Äù This is why it‚Äôs usually acceptable for a short guy to make fun of a tall guy. The logic is that if you‚Äôre speaking from the perspective of the disadvantaged, then you should be allowed to make jokes because it sorta evens things out. But a tall guy would be considered a cruel jerk if he pokes fun at a short guy because tall guys already have the advantages. So jokes coming from the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù seem unfair because the privileged already have the upper hand.\n\nIn our current society, black people are considered the ‚Äúunderprivileged‚Äù and white people are considered the ‚Äúprivileged.‚Äù This is why black people can make racist jokes all day but white people can‚Äôt. Y‚Äôall may not agree with this concept but it is what it is.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Oridginale24"}

I'm in university and have studied how privilege and oppression works in society. You can't be \"racist\"to white people because white peoples have never, and aren't oppressed based on their race. When you say mean things to white people, it's called \"discrimination based on race.\" People think discrimination based on race is the exact thing as racism, but racism is discrimination based on race and as well includes more complex things then that, Racism is connected to privilege and oppression. discriminating a white person and calling them a \"whitey\" is discriminatory and it is very rude and definitely NOT okay. But it doesn't have the same effect in society as calling a black person the N word, because white people arent oppressed and being called a \"whitey\" doesn't effect their privilege in life, it's basically just a form a mean bullying. Wheras when you do the same to a black person, it will effect their privilege in life because they are CURRENTLY and have historically been oppressed in society and it's a much different situation.

If you remember, she received quite a lot of backlash for this, but many came to her defense. A news website (can‚Äôt remember who it is atm) released an article (written by a white person) defending her stating that Asians can‚Äôt be cast in movies because they aren‚Äôt expressive/don‚Äôt have ‚Äòa diverse set of facial expressions‚Äô and so, that‚Äôs why Hollywood hires white people to play asians instead - which is CLEARLY very racist. The tweet was a response to that. Does it make it any less mean or rude? I mean no, but that‚Äôs the whole point of this segment right? \n\nChadwick & Tom‚Äôs tweets: I mean... if you really think these are racist well honey, you might need to chill out a bit!! I mean Chadwick is a bit white a white name, what‚Äôs so wrong with that??? The person just said they thought he‚Äôd have a more African-sounding name. Not sure what how that‚Äôs racist against white people. \nAnd Tom‚Äôs tweet.. I mean white people are literally the only people i‚Äôve ever witnessed applaud when a plane lands so they weren‚Äôt lying. These statements are NOT  racist, prejudice or are discriminative towards white people. If you think they are, then you need to take a step back and think about the fact that while you believe these are forms of racism, POC have to deal with being called terrorists, rapists, being killed by the cops etc \n\n(i apologize for any typos or grammar errors, if any)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Emily Ramsubir"}
