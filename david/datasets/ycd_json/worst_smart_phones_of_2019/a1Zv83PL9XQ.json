Used phone market tells the same story, Andriod phones depreciate by a far bigger margin at a mush faster rate, which means Andriod users feel they need to constantly ditch their phones and replace with new ones far more so than iOS users who, by comparison, don't seem to mind to keep using their old phone they already have.

Could it have something to do with the battery having that plastic protector on it? Maybe it's just coming loose from its connection, or something. If it's something as simple as that, it's really too bad for the manufacturer. If it weren't for that problem, it might be a pretty good phone for the price. Oh well.\nI don't think it's the worst phone, though. At least after the first two times it shuts down, you just ditch it and get a new phone.

This isn't some sort of threadbare device with ultra-low margins. It's more likely to be rebranded factory seconds - factory seconds due to the obvious hardware faults. I really doubt it's as simple as just putting a piece of paper in the battery compartment, otherwise they wouldn't have gone to the trouble of sticking it on an off-brand and selling it to customers defective. The reviews seem to indicate that they're all like this.\n\nWhat do you think is more of a hassle for them - fielding the various angry customers who try to squeeze a return/refund out of them, OR putting something more substantial in the battery compartment to fix the issue in house?\n\nThere could be a lot of other things wrong with it that cause it to shut off on impact that are far more intractable than battery compartment issues (which are extremely unlikely to make it past the design stage).\n\nCould be a weak solder joint on the mainboard somewhere which an impact is just sufficient to warp out of place enough that the device shuts down before returning to position. Somewhere where an impact might be enough to cause a tiny bit of board flex. It could be even higher level than that, a similar fault in one of the critical microchips (processor/RAM ie).\n\nWhatever it is, it won't be an easy or economical fix or they wouldn't have shipped them like that.﻿", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "Plans for the Creative Commons"}

The phone had a tendency to stop detecting my extension card, also it stopped working a few times and I needed to go into boot mode, the lock button it failed after 1 year and now I use a third app to unlock it using the finger scanner, I needed to factory reset the device a few times. Also just so you know Thor E is supposed to have 5k battery, it used to last me 2 days, now, I am lucky if i get 1 with some heavy use, but it has 3GB of RAM and decent storage.
