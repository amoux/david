I told myself ‚ÄúI never want to work for money again, but only because I enjoy the work I do‚Äù. I modeled Lester Brown‚Äôs spirit of absolute certainty and among at least hundreds of other applicants I got the position that would change my life and begin the path to fulfilling my own destiny. It has always been my dream to become an artist, and for the last 10 years, I‚Äôve been wanting to become an animator. I no longer have to wake up dreading the next few hours to come. Now I wake up and get ready to have fun! Now I draw animated characters for a living and the company is paying for me to go to school and get my bachelors in animation! I believe listening to this video about 3x a day for at least a week before my interviews helped get me in the right mindset to prove I am the only candidate for the Sketch Artist position. I am so blessed and lucky, but before all that, I had to believe I was worth it. I had to look at the Fatalist in the mirror and say ‚ÄúI am worthy of happiness, and I deserve to realize my purpose in life.‚Äù Then the man in the mirror smiled back at me. Every step thereafter has counted towards my dreams.Ôªø", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Miguel Reyes"}

One thing that pisses me off that people still believe that will hold you back more so then anything else in you're life \"find yourself\" how ever many ways you tell you're self to find you're way... Stop that and right now, while you're running off to find you're self understand that life is passing you back, there is no other or a slightly completed you out there so why are you searching... For a you that doesn't exist? That's like feeling like you want to be the person you once where... He or she (I'm not doing all these pronouns/transgenders/I identify as because it's ridiculous and scary that we are redefining what's natural so someone else can feel better about themselves instead of helping them, saying you have gender dysphoria, let's help you and stop this non sense, you don't feel like someone trapped in another body you want to be another gender because you're unhappy with what you have cut it out. But things are too scary in this topic because we're now forced by law to recognize mental illness as anything but mentally ill)\n\nBut to my opinion he or she is gone, doesn't exist anymore, instead of searching for a you that isn't real... It's more about creating, redefining by learning and self development in every way possible as much as you can. That's the trap, \"I want to be who I use to be\" and \"I'm trying to find myself\" no explore you're self, figure you're self out a little more daily, work on and fix aspects you don't like about you, use these videos to help yourself better and motivate yourself.Ôªø", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "GCT10/31/1990"}

Put on some music , not too loud, and have a positive attitude and dont expect too much perfection and just have fun!! If you like photography teach your child to take photos right along your side if you park them in front of the TV then that is what they will be used to and wont want to turn it off they start living in a fantasy world! Same with internet! Avoid it as much as possible!! Dont ask your child too many questions about the future especially their adult life- it creates anxiety! Put your infant right next to you in a safe area and involve them while you do things you enjoy! They will learn to be productive too as they grow!

I had started waking up when I became mother to my grandson and changed my focus. Now that he's older, there are so many things that fascinate me that I can't choose one to start with! \n\nI've found that the MOST important thing is to know, love and accept YOURSELF.  Once you accomplish that, everything else will fall into place. It requires effort - as does everything worth doing - but it's worth it. \n\nI have a large library of books (PDFs) that can help with this.  Anyone interested can contact me thru my channel.

{"cid": "UgwAsi6KblK5mRSnmuJ4AaABAg", "text": "I‚Äôm a fan of the law of attraction since I was 16. I always wanted to build a better life for myself, so I left home just after I turned 20 and moved 3000km away from everyone I knew, just to have more opportunities. Life slowly got better, but for that I had to work 60h/week and of course money still weren‚Äôt enough and I spent all my time working. Few weeks ago I stumbled across this Online Academy who‚Äôs purpose is to teach people how to build a Digital life for themselves. I‚Äôm learning now how to become an internet entrepreneur and build my own online business. üòÅ this is the future.. being able to create your own source of a passive income and work from anywhere you get internet access. That‚Äôs simply The Dream and thanks to the new technology, now it‚Äôs possible. \n\nI‚Äôm so excited about everything that‚Äôs happening and how this whole process is changing my life day by day. I had no previous experience at online marketing and technology, but they put together this amazing step by step system to make it easy. They created this amazing community of likeminded people who help each other every step of the way. It‚Äôs MINDBLOWING! I never thought this actually exists and I was very skeptical and afraid for the first few days in, until I found out this is genuine. When I realized that they all focus on using The Law of Attraction to create the life they want, I actually started crying:‚Äù This is exactly what I was asking for, and now it‚Äôs manifested in my life!‚Äù \n\nIn there you can find tons of training and support, from help with the system and technology to help with your mindset and personal growth. It‚Äôs absolutely incredible and hard to describe.. you have to see for yourself. \n\nI attached the link below if you guys are interested in taking a step towards changing your life, like I did. ‚ù§Ô∏è Digital Economy is booming and now it‚Äôs only the beginning. \n\nAnd don‚Äôt forget!! The Universe loves bold moves! üí™üòÅ\n\nIf you have any questions please add me on Skype ( moarcasoana )and I can help. I hope I‚Äôll see you on the other side. ü§ó Don‚Äôt hesitate to sign up for the Free 7 Days Video Series, you‚Äôll get more clarity about all this movement. \n\nhttp://justbelievethiscouldbeparadise.com/OanaAlexandra?pg=video-series&ty=video-series&t=fbfÔªø", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "oana alexandra"}

Everybody is too egotistical, too much into themselves to care about innocent animals life that wants to live but are killed just to fill humans egotistical SELFISH desires. They think life is only about humans and only humans matter. They do not put a thought not once on what the animals must be going through to be turned into a hot dog or bacon or burger, and that the animals had to be skinned alive in EXCRUCIATING PAIN  for you to have leather shoes, leather belts, leather coats, wallets bags and so on. They believe the old MacDonald had a farm fairytale in that the animals are treated with love but they do not think about DUuh the innocent animals have to be KILLED in order for me to eat them and or wear them.  What do you think that the animals go with a smile to the SLAUGHTERHOUSE and say woopiiii I get to be murdered today so people can eat me and or wear me HA! NOT A ONE. They are just like us, they have feelings and emotions and do not want to die they do not want to be slaved, exploited, incarcerated, confined, isolated, and such until a human says ok time to kill you so people can eat you and wear you. NO never that! They want to be free and want to enjoy life just like us. Be more compassionate and caring and for the sake of not contributing to animal cruelty please go veganÔªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Miriam Schiro"}

He was the only inspiration i ever had in my life, not my mom, siblings, famous people, in my head nobody was worthy enough, nobody that i can look up to.... for the first time in life i knew in what direction i want to go, everything that friend did on daily basis was like an eureka to me, he thought me so much about life without even realizing it. I admired him so much i wanted to be just like him. He was the real life version of my vision what kind of person i wanted to be.  And one day... i got the news that he killed himself... i was so confused why, i still am. What he did that day raised so many questions about life in general, and i just got tired of living life, just stopped caring about anyone or anything. I lost everything that day... I don't hate him for that, everything he did in life had some kind of purpose. Later i learned how fucked up his childhood was that probably led to that decision, he suffered from depression and i had no clue cause that man was the definition of happiness.... At least  that's what he allowed us to see. \n\nAnd now 3 years latter... im still sitting in this damn uncomfortable chair feeling lost, without a job, fucked up my collage education i stopped going out of the house, got chronically ill and i still don't care cause i feel unworthy just like all the years before i met this friend. Browsing my life away on the internet trying to motivate myself again... in hopes somebody or something will kindle the fire in me. I get myself moving for a few days a month, but that quickly falls apart cause i cant deal with my head and stay consistent at anything. So what i started doing is listening to these speeches as much as i can to burn it into my brain. To force myself to say yes to goals i was once 'hungry' for.  Talking to people became my worst fear, cause i cant really explain my thought process without being judged so im writing this here just to get it out... have a happy and productive decade people.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "prdi ludi"}

What's the worse thing mankind has ever invented ???? \nIs it the Nuclear Bomb that has such a destructive force that it could kill EVERY living thing on Our world? \nThe answer is \"No\". You'll laugh\nWhen I tell you that one of the most DESTRUCTIVE objects in YOUR life\nis in nearly everyone's house and it's NOT powered by electricity. What is it? \nIt's the MIRROR in your bedroom, bathroom, hall and wherever. \nWhen we look at our reflection,\nWe instantly JUDGE ourselves on our appearances. The mirror tells us that\nWe're attractive, ugly, young, old, fat, thin, and by your OWN JUDGEMENTof self, YOU either like or hate what you see. YOUR mirror, without saying a word, tells you that you ARE better     looking than others but, NOT as good looking as YOUR idol. Imagine a world without mirrors. What a different world it would be if you couldn't see your OWN reflection. Without the mirror, you would NEVER see yourself and thereby, you would have NOTHING to Compare yourself with. There would be NO competition to look better than others  as no one else Would ever know what they looked like either !  What's the meaning of this rant then?  Simple.\nDON'T look into your mirror for self appraisal, Cos if you're totally HONEST\nwith yourself, you may see self - condemnation staring back at you.\nYOU ARE NOT that reflection, YOU are\nA child of the Universe, a Spiritual Being that exits and extends beyond time and space, so, STOP JUDGING YOURSELF AND OTHERS BY THEIR OUTWARD APPEARANCES ! \nSome of the Most Beautiful SPIRITUAL\nPeople you have met have looked,  OUTWARDLY, like the biggest bag of garbage you've ever seen, but, INWARDLY, they are full of Wisdom, Empathy and have unlimited  Compassion and Unconditional love  for their fellow creatures. So, look AWAY from your mirrors and be your \"true\" Self as you REALLY are and were always MEANT to be. Peace and love to ALL being everywhere.

I was also on your boat.  When I was 28/29 years old, I started thinking about going back to school too.  I was working in commercial insurance for about 6 years after undergrad and I absolutely just hated what I did for a living.  It was scary to think that heading into my 30's that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing with my life.  It was scary to think of starting all over again, especially when my friends around me were getting married/having kids/buying houses.  But you know, everyone has their own roads, and everyone figures things out at their own time.  Anyway, long story short, I decided to take the leap and I started working on my prerequisite courses (which took me about 2 years) before actually getting into grad school for physical therapy.  I'm 35 now too and I have about a year and a half left before I graduate, and my program is a 3-4 year program at $100,000, not to mention living expenses.  It's a lot of money.  It's a big decision, definitely weigh out your pros and cons.  I guess what I am trying to say is if you are not currently happy with what you are doing and you are certain that you want to become a dental hygienist, I figure it's worth it to be doing something that you love.  I am not saying that the road is going to be easy.  It has definitely been a roller coaster of emotions these last couple of years with this career change, but at the end of the day, I have absolutely no regrets.  Just thought I'd share my story.  Good luck to you brother!Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Charles Shauf"}

If he thinks that swearing his head off is cool then he needs to watch his video. He likes to swear so much then it will only attract the same. Take notice fucker. Anything you have to say means shit because the only shit that spews from that hole in your face called a gob is disgusting foul language. This world has enough negativity in it without an agro negative fuckwit trying to preach positivity. It shows him up to be of minimal intelligence because an intelligent person doesn't have to use swear words to fill up a sentence. Shut your negative face the fuck up. What you were trying to say is nada, just like you!!!Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Turuhira Ngaronoa"}

I was just a little bit in my head like \"if you don't gettt shit shittt atta here.\" So at that point i realized, okay, obvious click bait, but then i started hearing speeches, that outright just changed my life. Motivational pieces are a dime a dozen okay, they all usually sound the same to a certain extent with slight variation, or different perspectives on already looked upon topics. But man, when that man spoke, there was something different. There was having had the hard times, there was his own self transition as well, but he made me laugh like never before. It was like combining a good black comedian, that rocky feel where you go from nothing to something but more intense, but some how still exuding this unbelievably positive outlook on life, truly vibrant energy that overwhelms you. So i just have to be the first one to say, I have got to thank you for your personal use of clickbait, because it lead me to something so powerful and life changing, that i may not have necessarily clicked with a different thumbnail. Besides, 10 times a day you click on a random clip not even looking at the title just to see some tits or some half clothes wearing woman to draw attention, i think this is using thumbnails for a good purpose for once.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Shayne Williams"}

Teaching children lessons that is one of the hardest lessons to teach child or adult. Lessons like self confidence, how to brake down goals into steps, how to do things that adults struggle with everyday. Our nation makes it impossible to understand that everyone is gifted. The only gifts that children know even exist is the most common gifts. A child with a gift or curiosity about being something that can not be explored like sports or the clubs offered within school stop exploring and feeding that gift. This is a non-profit idea that I need guidance on. I have no one in my life other than my three little girls and a family full of negative thinkers. Therefore, creating a atmosphere of loneliness, not because I do not believe in my idea or because I do not know which way to go, or because I do not believe in my self. I fear I will loose this battle if I can not find a mentor. I have asked college they said they didn't understand what I meant but good luck. Please just give me an idea on where to find a mentor. The only path I know to take is to start meaningless business until I can create this business myself. If anyone could give any tip please let me know.
