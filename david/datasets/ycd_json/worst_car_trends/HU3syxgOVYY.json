On my car, if the turn indicator is not turned off within....I am guessing 60 seconds, the annoying ticking sound becomes a loud bong.  How do I know this? There was a car behind me a few months ago that signalled a turn for MILES, so when I tried to alert the driver to the annoyance, I discovered this \"feature\".\nConversely, because the dome light on my car does not work (my car is a retired police car), it has been nice to know, via a beeping sound, that one of the doors is not completely closed.\n\nI hate electronic emergency brakes because unlike a conventional lever or foot brake, you can't always tell by looking at the button if the emergency brake is on or off.\nAnd the proliferation of different shifting....handles? knobs? buttons? is stupidity bordering on dangerous.  In the 50s the US government stepped in because manufacturers had different automatic transmission shift arrangements.  Some had PRNDL, while some had PDRNL, and others had other arrangements.  You shouldn't have to consult your owner's manual to find out how to shift an automatic transmission equipped vehicle.\n\nFinally, spare tires weren't just deleted to save space, but also to save WEIGHT.  As I understand it, the brackets/classes for allowable emissions from your car's tailpipe are broken up into myriad groups separated in some cases by 50 pounds.  A spare steel wheel WITHOUT a  tire for a compact car can weigh 20 pounds....add a tire and the total for a compact car jumps to nearly 30 pounds, or more than half of that 50 pounds.  And my experience from traveling several thousands of miles per year?  Folks rarely get flats, and when they do they don't want to get dirty and sweaty changing a tire....assuming they even have enough confidence to tackle the job.

Guess it depends on the type of system (when it stops the engine etc.), as for audio warnings, most of them are subtle enough to give warning and not be anoying... electronic parking brake... dunno dont have it, but I think its tailored to 90% of drivers that never used it for anything else other than parking...

Kids don't stop cocking around with them, then they complain it's too hot/cold when you lock them.\n\n Inbuilt sat nav. Just, no. They're clunky and unreliable most of the time, are often part of the radio/CD player (if new cars still have those) and at least on Peugeots, they turn on by themselves even if you turned the screen off (it turns off properly when reversing (sensible idea) but then when you put it in neutral or 1st it comes on full glare, like WTF, I turned it off for a reason)\n\nBluetooth. Kids these days are tech savvy. They'll connect before I do. Those little shits will then play their shit on a loop for the next 20000000 miles and I can't do anything to stop them because Johnny copper will have me for using my phone or the kids will cry because it's not the Frozen soundtrack.\n\nThe Ford flippy badge thing to open the bonnet. First off, it means taking the key out the ignition, not ideal if I'm trying to check what's making that squeaky noise. Second, some sticky fingered little arsehole will play around with it, break it then get something stuck in the keyhole leaving me unable to refill the radiator YOU BROKE THE CAR TIMMY!!! DON'T CRY BECAUSE YOU MISSED LEGOLAND, YOU STOPPED DADDY FROM FILLING THE BLOODY RADIATOR, YOU SNOT-FACED WANKER!!!\n\nThose extra stalks for the Radio controls. I want to indicate left, not skip past Dancing Queen, that shit is my racing music.\n\nHorns on the steering wheel. Just bring back the little trumpet thing with the rubber squeezy bit. Those things take the edge off road rage.\n\nOddly positioned signals. Often this encompasses the side indicator, one expects this below the mirror, just ahead of the door. Quirky ones on a mirror tip or some other bizarre place take longer to spot and make the car look stupid.\n\nSTDIGTRVTECRSXYZ etc bollocks. I swear by this point everything has some assortment of \"performance\" lettering on the back. I don't give a shit if it's got RS TDI STD TURBOMEGA BOOSTER on the back. It's still a Polo and it detracts from true performance packages. \n\n(Applies to one particular brand) BMW logos plastered everywhere. The indicators even have them. Beemers are cool but sticking the logo on every surface just looks pretentious.\n\n\"Super-mini\" in the description. It's a fucking landbarge. The Fiat 500 and Mini Cooper (BMW) are the worst culprits. The originals were compact enough to drive on the pavement and still leave room for the postman. Now they're the same size as everything else.\n\nThe Chelsea Tractor. We're talking Range Rover Sport+Vogue, Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q series, BMW X series and tragically even the Disco 4. A 4x4 is for having fun on a muddy mountain, not for lugging kids around in while taking up an entire road with terrible parking.\n\nOn that subject, treadplate on brand new Defenders (RIP). It started out as a farmers on the spot repair. You're a drug dealer in Brighton, Carl, you look like a twat.\n\nGarish colours. In the good old days you had Tasteful Blue, Handsome Black, Civilised Green and Charming red. Now you see things in such a bright shade of orange your face melts up and the dog throws up in shock. Also, why would anyone want a car in the same shade of brown as a lump of dog shit?\n\nPockets on the backs of seats. Trying to spruce the car up, make it look nice when I take granny to the airp...

Everything else I can easily find valuable, voice control so you don't have to take your hands off the wheel, or eyes with concentration of the road, bings/bongs to keep the driver more aware then just a small glowing light that can easily ignored. Bigger key fob to have more features, plus if you spend a bunch of money then I'd hope to get a large fancy fob (like that cool BMW touch screen one, over the top but cool), lack of buttons is okay as it allows you to have more features in a small screen rather then a cluttered center console, electronic e-brake is okay, yeah it can take away cool drifts but I don't think everyone drifts or whatever, start stop is normally something you can turn off in settings most of the times,  lane departure systems is something the world needs to try so later they enhance/develop a more advanced autonomous driving, and tire repair kits are fine tbh, if it fixes your tire for long enough to get you somewhere to get fixed then it's fine, plus some people just end up taking it out.

If it's night time you can't get a full size tyre repaired as tyre places aren't open at night here anyway.\nAlso start/stop is a pain in the arse and I'd have the activating circuit removed by an auto electrician. \nThe traditional key is far better that push button start coupled with proximity keys. The plastic push button start will break as the plastic ages.\nThe endless chimes when low on fuel, opening a door, or if you've left the headlights on and they're not on an auto system. Manufacturers could link the headlights to the ignition so when you turn the car off the headlights go off too. My dad's 1976VW Golf had that. But now it's endless chimes, bongs and dings.\nVoice control is alright until the voice changes like if you have a cold and your voice is much deeper then the voice control doesn't recognise your voice.\nElectronic handbrake is another gizmo that'll wear out long before a traditional handbrake will. Traditional handbrakes also come with a self adjusting handbrake cable.\nTouch screens. We don't need apple car play or android car play. You're there to drive not fiddle with the entertainment system and no one is going to pull over to the side of the road, stop and do it.\nLane departure warnings for people who are too busy fiddling with the android and apple play or who have their face buried in a smart phone merrily texting.  \nBlind spot monitoring. There is no such thing as a blind spot. It's a car manufacturer invention. If people have the exterior mirrors adjusted properly then they have no blind spot and no need for blind spot monitoring. The mirrors should be adjusted to the lane next to you not looking down the side of your car. Believe it or not the side of your car will not leave you. It will remain there for your entire journey. People say what about parking when you need to see down the side of the car.

Imagine that you are in the middle of nowhere, late at night, you are on your way for holidays with your family (wife+children) and you've got a flat tire. If the hole is big in the tire, the \"repair kit\" is useless and you are stuck in a car with only 3 tires \"working\" and with your family in it waiting to arrive at your holiday destination. Excellent situation, ah?\nAnd the most annuying? In most modern cars (even in some saloon or SUV cars), you can't get a spare tire anymore. Only the \"repair kit\".

Start/Stop feature only activates if the vehicle is at operating temperature, and is not demanding defrost, a/c, or any extra electrical load. It is, for the most part, non-invasive to the driver experience, as it only does its thing when you need the engine the least. And as it goes for extra wear, that is non-existent, because like I said, the engine is going to be at operating temperature. And you don't have to worry about burning out a starter, because it uses direct injection and a spark plug to start it back up.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "MEG Crafter"}

A \"yes, thanks, shut up now\" button is useful.\n\nIn aviation there are many audible warnings. While some are to be responded to immediately (certain ground proximity warnings, about to land with the landing gear up etc) others are not always, and in some circumstances it is safer to leave the emergency a few minutes until the aircraft is in a safe situation (engine fire just at take-off for example; it is left until safely airborne as the design allows for a few minutes of fire without further hazard and jet engines are meant to be on fire inside anyway). In this case the pilots' first action is to silence the alarms. The big red lights, or amber lights for less serious problems, keep glowing or flashing, but the flight deck is quiet and the crew can focus.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Doubting Rich"}

I don't get a bong that reminds me to put my seatbelt on. I do that as a matter of course. A bong that tells me I have lost brake pressure before I next glance a the dash, or that warns me there is a big problem, look at the lights now, very useful\n\n2. Not annoying at all, and for the generations who are growing up with Cortana and Siri, perfectly natural. I don't know of any vehicle where it is the sole method of control. Only annoying if you use it and it doesnt work, dont use it and it cant annoy. How simple a concept is that?\n\n3. See 2. \n\n4. Does save fuel. Makes living next to a busy junction quieter. \n\n5. Seriously, how many people actually use the parking brake for anything other than parking? Heck lots of people with autos dont even use it for that. A little button, even better the automatic one that is available on many new vehicles, with added benefits such as anti-roll-back for starting on slopes, far more sensible. Nobody I know uses it \"on the track\" either, just sometimes very rarely on very certain kinds of track, such as in rallying as you show. You do not need the handbrake to perform powerslides or drifts either\n\n6 Keyless entry. So I can have a little card or fob (smaller than most smartphones) anywhere on my person and just jump in and go. No digging keys out of pockets or bags, no finding the right key on the ring, no sharp edges shredding my pocket linings. You really did get that one backwards.\n\n7 Of course, nobody ever hit the wrong radio station button before touchscreens. Drivers are not \"forced to browse around\", all the regular, important features are still good old stalks etc, even on that nice new shiny Tesla. Other than tactile feedback, just how is a button on a touchscreen any different from a mechanical button? Especially as mechanical buttons havent actually switched much on or off for many years, merely told a computer to do it. \n\n8 LDS. Ever driven with it? they do not \"rebound\" or insist, they are easily overridden with minimum pressure on the wheel\n\n9 I haven't had a puncture on a paved road in years, and a can of sealant is quicker and safer for the average Joe than trying a wheelchange at the roadside, especially on fast roads.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Steve Smith"}

Get rid of it entirely, give me a speedo in front of the wheel, maybe a tacho and a satnav/radio who needs anything else?

Call a weird poor kid (because I am) but I've always had (and still do have) older cars from before 2000.

Heck, I've hardly ever even had a key fob for long but I just don't feel comfy getting into a car without having to even touch the key.

Driving a manual gives you a feeling of being one with the car. Automatics require no outside interference other than turning the steering wheel and applying the brakes and gas when needed. It gets monotonous after a while. A manual on the other hand demands your attention almost all the time, requiring input from most of your limbs. Left foot, clutch in. Right hand, downshift. Right foot, rev your engine. Left foot, off clutch. It's poetic almost. This is also coming from a guy who doesn't know a lot about cars and taught himself how to drive manual. So, take this with a grain of salt.Ôªø", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Samuel Agan"}

I genuinely think touch screens are so dangerous in cars, far too distracting. Unlike a button you lose one of your senses, you can't operate the cars functions by touch. Which means you have to do it by sight, you need to physically look at where you're  pressing to make sure your doing it. And usually you need to keep looking to check your input was recognised cos half the touch screens crash or go unresponsive randomly. And if you're  on a bumpy road it's a fucking nightmare to change the radio station, your hand getting thrown all over the screen, and you end up adjusting the weight of the steering instead of changing the radio. I own a Porsche 944, it has a rear wiper and a heated rear window and a cassette player. That's it. And I can find all of those buttons by touch without looking away from the road. Meanwhile my mate in his Golf is fiddling with the suspension settings and fucking about with how long he wants the kerb lights on when he turns the ignition off, why??? Why does his car need to do this? Why are modern cars filled with all this useless shit we don't need? How come we have to buy a car and then spend forever adjusting it?

I have one great example for the voice control: My father drives a 2017 BMW 520d, which is said to have the best voice control system in the world at the moment. He wanted to call my grandma (his mother) and so he said to his car \"call Mum\". The car replied with \" 'Mother' can not be found in your contacts\". And this drove my Dad mad - because the car understood that he wanted to call his mother, but wasn't able to just select the contact that was named \"Mum\" which was just what he said. \"Mother\" was indeed not a contact, but that's not what my Dad had asked for anyways. Anyways, after a bit of arguing with the car, it decided to solve the Problem once and for all - the conversation ended with the car's hilarious message: \" 'Mum' has been added to your Mother\" üòÇÔªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "German Perfectionist"}

{"cid": "UgxUtw1YW-rkL1hvv614AaABAg", "text": "1. The warning sounds:when your seatbelt is not fastened and your just going to do repark your car in a parking lot, tell me, would you fasten your seatbelt because of a light in the dashboard? No! And parking lots are VERY unsafe, because due to parked cars, you may not see a car turning at a turn for example, and they would smash into you 2. Here you say you should rather do it yourself, but later in the video you say touching screens while driving is unsafe. Pick one! 3. Okay you won this one. But you have to admit its pretty cool. 4. I'd DOES save fuel, fifth gear once proved it, and of you don't like it you can just turn it off.5. the electronic handbrake not only makes cars interiors much prettier, but it's also a safety feature. When the driver faints or has a heart attack, the passenger can pull it to stop the car relatively safely, unlike with regular handbrakes.6. while huge keyfobs aren't good, the bmw screen-key you showed can be genuinely useful for example like you showed there, you can check the cars fluids without even getting in the car which is good for non car people. 7. Touchscreens are also for cleaning up interiors but they also help the elderly or ppl with bad vision because there can be just some of the buttons on different screens making them larger instead of putting a million tiny buttons all over the place.8. the sverving thing would never happen because the systems aren't stupid. They just make you safer, like if you fainted or fell asleep behind the wheel, you would thank the system for not crashing into a pole and taking turns or maybe stopping and putting the hazards on.9. in my opinion, it is worth it, because it works and most people would throw the old tyre out anyway. I get that all of these things have disadvantages, but their advantages (in my opinion) outweigh themÔªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "A- dino"}

And the E-handbrake is in my opinion good. If you do nothing but daily driving with your car. But if it can get annoying. For example, my dad owns a 2008 Renault Espace and sometimes for literally no reason it says that the handbrake is broken. Even tho it works just fine. At the end, he has to go to a service where they deactivate this warning trough computer (by the way it isn't quite cheap what gets me the most. Also, you have to rev the car up to like 5000 RPM which in diesel...you get the idea. But there is always the option to install a hydraulic handbrake since if you use the normal handbrake too much it will damage or even break down completely. With the keys: They are useful, with the feature that if you need to open the boot of your car you just press a button. Or if your child wants to get to the car as quickly as possible you can open it from distance. But I think there is no better feeling than turning that key and seeing the engine startup (or not if you have a project car) apart from well-executed handbrake turn obviously. And I think that the 'normal' keys washed off because of people got lazier and also, let's be honest the locks were quite easy to break in. Touchscreen commands are however a very good feature if the screen's placed in good position. It in many cases allows getting more sophisticated and faster system into the computer. Unlike buttons, there is usually quite short or no delay at all between the moment you press the screen and computer's reaction. Of course, it has some flaws. You mentioned the main ones: precision and safety. In that case, I think the driver should be allowed to use the touchscreen or ordinary buttons. Becuase it isn't a bad idea to just play with the touchscreen while you're waiting somewhere but when you're moving it all different game. So...chaning lanes with the computer. Unless we have perfect top-notch roads all over the world, these systems are useless, for example here in the Czech Republic (or Czechia if you will) the roads especially the main roads or even highways are so bad that the Tesla system wouldn't even allow you to turn it on. Also, I think that all the systems are made for these top-notch roads and therefore they may make a mistake if you drive somewhere, where it isn't the top-notch quality. But I have to admit that sign reading systems are useful unless it limits your top speed at what the sign says.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Eli√°≈° Mach√°lek"}

I only use my parking brake for parking on a hill, and I can't think of a time I'd be annoyed by engine stop/start.\nI agree completely about the spare tire.
