It is a matter of taste. Of course. \n\n\nHad a Renault Megane for a short while (2017 one) it had a digital instrument cluster. Looked really nice and made the car feel modern., even if the rest of the interior was nothing special. Now I drive a 2016 Polo (soon going to the new Corolla or Mazda 3) and it has very basic and simple cluster. I think it makes the cabin feel even more bland and dated than it already is. Some might like the simplicity of it, but I prefer to look ad an interior that feels new and fresh.  But then again I lease cars for 4 years or 150.000 km, so long-term reliability is not really a concern for me.\n\n\nSome people say that analogue clusters feel timeless. I just can't look at it that way. \n\n\nI disagree with the whole distraction point. I have never felt that the screens in a car are distractions, far from it. If they work well you really don't have to look at them that much in the first place. And if you have navigation open sometimes you have to look, so in that situation it is easier to have it at leas a bit high up so you don't have to look down that much. Also bigger screens, within a limit, of course.... (Tesla).... Makes text and other things a lot easier to read and, if done right, makes on-screen buttons easier to tap.

In terms of complex tech, the aircon will check which seats are actually occupied and only work in those areas by automatically controlling the air and seat temperatures, plus it moisturises your skin while it's at it.\n\n\nThing is though, it's also a ridiculous sleeper, especially considering I'm in the UK where the average car has about 150bhp (because fuel costs about 3x more here). I can see how those things would be annoying but when a manufacturer makes it work, they all make sense. I'm not suggesting the GS450h is the best car ever, but it's a good example of getting it right- it still handles incredibly well, goes like a rocket but then you shove it in eco mode and it's like driving a Rolls Royce (at least much closer than you'd expect for 1/5 of the cost). Plus, it's a Lexus so it's not going to break, even the mental transmission, which actually works well for both performance and cruising. The batteries even have a 10 year warranty, so no issues there.\n\n\nI will say though, that they have to get it right for all this to be good. Since I used an example of Lexus getting it right, they also make the CT, which is I believe statistically the world's most reliable new car. It's also horrible.

{"cid": "Ugw50vhayKtNvjbGNGp4AaABAg", "text": "Fun fact, when you open one window in a car that is less than ten years old, the air coming in will be split by the pillar behind the window, and it will cause an extremely uncomfortable vibration that irritates every person in the vehicle. This behavior is comparable to an organ pipe. When you think organ, think church, or theater. They have pipes ranging in size from the size of a pencil to the length of a wooden power line pole. The range in size is to cover every note and pitch on an equally tempered keyboard instrument, which the pipe organ is. The pitch is measured in feet. Middle c is in the 8 foot pitch range. Higher pitches go up, 4', 2' 1', and even some fractions in between like 5 and 2/3'. Lower pitches go down, 16', 32' 64'. There is a variety of types of pipes that might extend the full length, as in open pipes, some that are half the labeled pitch length,  as in stopped pipes, and also twice the length, as in overblown pipes. Then there are pipes designed to fit in a small space, while still filling their required length to resonate at the proper pitch. These are Mitered, or 'bent' around like a concert tuba, or forwards like a saxophone. This is purely compensating for limited space. Pipes can have different voices. This is based on their speaking element, which can be flue, like a recorder, and reed, like an oboe. It is also based on their voicing, which is very mathematical in some ways, and I don't understand it yet. Now that you know more about a pipe organ, I will get to the point. The vibrating air inside the car resonates within the passenger cabin when split by the window frame. When the valve under a flue pipe is opened and the air flows into it, it encounters a barrier which has a slit facing the front of the pipe. The slit allows air through, and guides it towards a splitter. The air runs into the splitter, and is guided either outside of the pipe or into the resonator. The air that goes into the resonator vibrates with increasing intensity, and it becomes audible, or inaudible, sound. Now you can see the comparison; the flue is the window, and the passenger cabin is the resonator. It is a fun comparison for me when I find myself in one of these newer motor vehicles, and I have the natural instinct to open the window. I realize my mistake, and as the cabin begins to resonate, I close the window, because everybody hates that. On with the air conditioner, I suppose.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "MrManiac3"}

{"cid": "Ugw50vhayKtNvjbGNGp4AaABAg.8pRwB-4zACJ8q1ppxwSvRH", "text": "Larry Schwartz that is exactly right. It seems, from what I have seen just in life, that the double seal came about in the mid to late 90s, as I've seen it in vehicles that I've ridden in. I also recall that a couple vehicles from the late 80s that I have looked closely at do not have a double seal. The cars from the 90s/early 2000s that I have had experience with noticeably did not resonate in such an uncomfortable way. This can probably be attributed to the age of the vehicle, the breakdown of that seal over time, and the high probability that the seals were not manufactured properly. Both options--proper seal or improper seal--have their trade offs. A proper seal insulates a bit of noise coming into the cabin, but when windows are open, the wind causes uncomfortable vibration. An improper seal allows the air to flow more smoothly in the cabin by comparison, and only blows your hair around and causes noise. When the windows are closed, less noise from outside the cabin is blocked from entering, and as you say, you can hear more of the road. There are other factors to hearing the road, such as suspension stiffness and tire diameter, as well as road quality to begin with. But ignoring that, window seal does have a large influence on noise. When it comes down to it, it's the driver's preference. Does the driver want a quiet car? Does the driver want windows that can be opened on the highway? Does the driver want to understand the car, or does the driver want the car to shush? It's up to the driver to decide.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "MrManiac3"}

It's not wickedly overstyled with hundreds of sharp pointless angles, there's no big stupid gross grill, the doors aren't ' dented ' in like so many newer models, I have a REAL spare tire and a REAL key, there's no distracting tv screen with menus within menus making it hard to find certain functions, all the controls have REAL knobs and buttons that are so easy to use, after 17 years I've got them all memorized and can adjust things without even taking my eyes off the road, and if I have to check the gauges, they're right in front of me, not the centre console, and they're simple and quick to check. My car doesn't shut off at a stop sign, I'd really, really hate that, there's no stupid sensors everywhere that can and WILL fail in time, ALL the fluids are easy to check and replace, there's no driver assisted anything, which has forced me to become a better driver over the years, it's far cheaper to fix anything on my car, and after all these years, my V6 still runs like a clock, unlike so many turbocharged 4 bangers that are crapping out faster than you can say ' gigantic repair bill ' and my 4 speed automatic transmission is still functioning flawlessly, and it even came with a block heater as standard equipment because not everyone lives in Florida. What I'm doing at this point is waiting until they start to delete the most obnoxious trends in styling and function regarding ICE cars, either that or until they come up with an electric car that will give me 500 real world miles worth of range with a 25k price tag, whichever comes first.

A few things he has talked about that stood out to me in this video are- Auto start stop. Ive Been informed that the auto start stop vehicles actually have a second starter motor specifically for that use. If you pay attention, listen to the difference in time it takes to start a vehicle normally and when the vehicle auto starts. The Auto start is much quicker. Along with that, in an engineering explained video fuel consumption is talked about. An engine idling for about anything over 30sec uses more fuel than starting the engine. With that said, I think if companies use the auto start stop they should shut the engine off after it becomes wasted fuel instead of immediately when you stop. Lastly every car I've driven that has a start stop has had a switch or button that is easily accessible to turn the feature off. You dont have to dig through settings and menus to turn it off.

I had one for 2 years in a (company car)'17 Ford Fusion and didn't care for some of the timing of when it turned off typically right when I needed it to go for immediate take off - say to make a quick left out of a neighborhood onto a busy road.  Pain if I didn't remember to disable when I started the car.  Your idea of turning off after it starts wasting fuel, wouldn't really work due to timing - how would it know if the stop light I was at changed at the 35 second mark or 2 minute mark?  Shutting down after 30 secs for example would mean it's idling for 30 seconds, then off for 5 wasting that initial 30 sec. fuel burn off.

The madness behind it is sexist in that it assumes women to be poorer drivers than men so they need a big load of metal around them to protect them on the school run. The knock on effect of this is it does actually end up making women drivers take risks they wouldn't normally take as they have the protection of 3 tons of steel around them. This is fine and dandy for them but not too cool when you are in a normal person's car watching a woman too afraid to drive through a small puddle at the road's edge and instead decides to nearly kill you as she swerves in to your lane to avoid dirtying the alloy rims....or exposes all her precious cargo of children to the extreme risk of collision by pulling out of a junction in front of you when all she had to do to be safe is wait the 10 seconds it would take for you to pass on by safely and then she is safe to pull out as as there is nothing behind you...which she would know if she could be bothered to look instead of texting and just blindly following whatever the car in front has done. And before you all get on my case about slating women drivers...the men are no better...to make an instant dick head...just add 1 x man to a Range Rover or other similarly useless when off-road vehicle. Indicators (turn signals) not needed...driving standards out the fucking window. These piles of shit bring out the worst in people.

Just last week, I was getting out of my car and I noticed the car I parked beside was running and didn't see anybody inside. Ignoring it, I returned to my car in about 2 hours and that same car was still there, engine running.  I was nosey this time and looked in the windows and confirmed nobody was in front or back of this car. Now you can't fix stupid, but I imagine if that driver had the habit of putting their key in and out of the ignition they would have a much lower chance of leaving their car with the \"key\" inside and accidentally leaving the engine running.  I get buttons are more convenient, but seriously how far does it have to go?

I'm looking for a very simple car that is reliable and can get 300K miles.  Looks like I will buying an old 1990s Toyota or Honda.  I can get a rebuilt engine and transmission for say $5000.  Put in a new clutch and suspension components for $1500.  Bring the seats to an upholster for $1000.  Repaint and fix rust for $2000.  Throw in $2000 for miscellaneous stuff.  Figure on $2000 for the used car.  The total is $13,500 for a car that will do 300K miles.  Insurance will be really cheap too, as well as registration.  Guess what automakers, I have saved a ton of money that I can spend on something that I feel is important.  BTW the fuel mileage on the old small cars is just as good as new cars.  If I need more space I will put on a $300 roof rack.  The only thing missing is airbags.  However, if people quit using their cell phone in the car and messing with the undecipherable infotainment system, they wouldn't be getting in crashes and needing air bags.\n\nI will have a real dipstick, full spare tire and not runflats, windows I can actually look out, a radio I can figure out, and simple heating knobs and levers.  Parts are also really cheap.\n\nEnough is enough!!!  Detroit you are getting rid of small reliable cars so you can cash in on truck and SUV market.  BTW...most new trucks and SUVs will NOT get 100K miles with our spending $10,000 for something that breaks.  I will not play.\n\nConsumers...pull your head out of your ass.  Don't play their game.  Go to the dealership or automaker web page and say you will no longer buy into this crap.  Alas...I know you won't do it because most people are just downright stupid (not just ignorant).\n\nI have used/programmed computers since 1974 and understand technology.

I'm also familiar with the stats for hospital deaths due to errors, which outweigh all highway deaths by a factor of about 12. Saving lives requires choices and allocations. \n-- Light trucks (SUVs, pickups, and vans) had, in 2012, a 47% higher fatality rate than cars in single-vehicle crashes, presumably due to their higher centers of gravity. Single-vehicle crashes accounted for 55% of all highway deaths. Shouldn't we do something to discourage non-essential SUV purchases, like extending the left-lane ban on highways to light trucks? That could discourage a lot of people from buying SUVs, cost virtually nothing, and even generate revenue.\n-- As cars become more complicated, they become more expensive to fix, and more disposable.

If driving is left to only the people who enjoy it, there would be fewer vehicles on the road. For the people who don't care about their motor vehicles, it would make sense to provide public transit, but not everyone cozies up to that idea. That is probably due to their preconceived notions and past experiences with public transit. More attention towards public transit could bring such features as private cabins and cleaner passenger environments. Such things would improve passenger experiences. Of course, a market can't be driven in a direction that has little interest, and thinking about such a goal simplistically, ignoring factors that influence change and factors that cause disapproval among consumers won't allow you to influence effectively. Considering the variety of communities in the United States, those which have dense infrastructures and those that don't, you can see where this market would be focused, and where it wouldn't. That is ignoring public interest in public transit, which is especially low in suburban communities. There is another way to discourage driving on top of that. That is making the world come to the consumer. This can range from walking downtown for your groceries and everything ooh may need, to delivery of any necessity and at home work. I'm not interested in going down that rabbit hole. Nor am I interested in public transit, beyond historical examples, going back before the middle twentieth century. My interests lie in the antique; clothing, architecture, theaters, music, films, television, etcetera. I'm not a fan of public interests that defined the common interest, such as consumerism, drugs and alcohol, trends, and ignorance. I still find it interesting in historical context, though. There are things that I find exceptional. My favorite topics are theater organ, aeroplane, and automobile. I'm glad that I was born more recent, as organizations that promote such antique pieces of history are more accessible than ever, and there are more people who are open to supporting them for whatever reason. Being born in the twenty first century, if just by several months, I don't have decades of experience and wisdom.

The secondary issue here is one of government interference with the minutiae of citizens' lives and purchasing decisions. And those who pressed for the original mandate were definitely pushing for increasing government control of citizens' lives as a general policy (Claybrook, Nader, et al.). This in turn shrinks the domain of personal responsibility, and the more a society shrinks that domain, the more it creates a class of dependents who require even more government support and guidance, which in turn, allows government bureaucrats to gain even more power. It's just one of thousands of little steps in the direction of elitist totalitarianism. Some government involvement in safety regulations are necessary, but they should be chosen carefully.

And yes, do not change anything when in fails but simply buy a new one! And I completely loathe this approach.

And I know personally in detail what I am talking about! And I can elaborate or other manufacturers too! Where the injection system is a \"consumer\" product! So please!

They use a different gear-ratio to allow the starter to run at a lower RPM. They use different brushes (when brushes are used), they use needle bearings, they decouple the mechanical action from the electrical action of stopping and starting the motor, the ECM/PCM communicates with the starter and informs it when each cylinder reaches TDC. \r\n\r\n@ 10:53 - My old 95 T-Bird had a 4.6L V8 that ran about 2200 RPM at 70Mph, my new I-4 engine has a 6-speed transmission and runs at 2100-2200 RPM at 70Mph. Efficiency yes, but also the potential for reduced engine wear.\r\n\r\n@13:19 - The areas that are't painted are those which are prone to paint chipping from rocks and debris. The primary purpose, aside from costs, is so you don't end up destroying the paint making it look terrible and also prevent rust from forming because some people don't realize how important proper paint care is. Some people buy these cars and drive down dirt roads, improperly maintained roads or simply roads that generally have alot of debris due to the amount/type of traffic that use them and this can help with future maintenance costs on the exterior.\n\nThe sterilization is real though... unfortunately it's the consumers that are directing this move based on their purchase decisions; Which is why is definitely won't go away anytime soon. Great video though, goes over alot of topics. Honestly I only wanted to mention the first thing about the starters because I've had many people ask about it. The starters are designed to handle the extra usage, however they are also more expensive to replace when they eventually fail. Also, having no oil dipstick is a dipshit thing to do... they really need to stop doing that... They CVT is an incredible implementation for a transmission, like you stated, the main issue that has been with CVT is manufacturers trying to cater to people by defeating its purpose to make it 'feel' like a regular transmission.

What's with Ford deciding that literally nobody wants to buy a sedan these days? Do we all want sucky SUVs and crossovers? Really? Car makers should be offering more choices, not fewer. Two door coupes used to be very popular, before the car makers raised the prices above 4 door sedans. Sedans and even station wagons are still popular in Europe. European cars also have noticeably better interiors and complain about American interiors. What's up with that? Do Americans really not care about how the interior looks, how the controls feel?\n\nThe other thing is that car buyers really can distinguish between real and fake. Why do car makers insist on putting fake stuff on their cars? Fake wood, fake carbon fiber, fake scoops and vents, fake floating roof, fake chrome, fake engine noise, fake CVT shifts, fake harsh sports suspensions, fake offroad capabilities?

And i put up with that for 11 years.\n\nAfter that I purchased a used RAV4. Not because of the \"sports\" stuff or off road or shitty fuel economy compared to my 35-40 mpg yaris, But I got it because it was roomier. SO fucking much more than my car. No more banging my head or knees. No more scraping the roof of the car with my scalp! I CAN FUCKING SEE THE SIGNAL LIGHTS NOW!!! \n\nYes it's just a sedan with a station wagon body crammed on it, same 4 cylinder, same transmission, but thats what I wanted, I wanted a larger \"car\" I wanted something like my Yaris but just bigger!

It is too difficult to text and drive and shift and change the music at the same time. Again, I love the NV3500 in my Silverado. But if they want to make the fuel efficiency claim, my truck sees an average of 17 mpg city with the 5.3L V8, versus even newer automatic trucks are still below that.\n3. Styling - everything these days looks the same, all the same eurotrash styles with minor variations that even Europeans don't want.

They're forcing these over complicated vehicles along with their extortion level pricing. Even the base model vehicles are so far beyond what is required for a simple vehicle.

All the snobs and grannies lost, because it wasnt a sustainable model to switch up all this stuff to please them.\n\nTake the Quad 4 as a prime example. It was a wonderful motor, plagued by corporate decisions and bean counters. They used the wrong thickness head gasket despite the engineers' wishes, they decided on a horrid oil system that created the pancake batter effect in early motors, that was later revised. And then, they decided to bog it down by adding more and more plastic garbage to please the grannys who complained that it was 'too noisy'. They kept the high power Quad 4 cars in a seperate catagory until 95', but ended up screwing themselves by continuing the noise dampering on the motor. They added .1 liter, balanced shafts, and an absolute nightmares worth of plastic to the intake, and released the 2.4L Twin Cam. Its still a great motor, but it was the quietest and most tame of the engine family to date. In order to really wake it up, youd have to remove all the plastic, and add a custom setup. They basically hushed the engine to make sure granny jenkins was happy. The ecotech went though the same ordeal. And not it has so much plastic on it that it may as well be a fisher price toy.\n\nIf manufacturers listened to its real customers and supports, instead of the press and pristine pricks that wouldnt know a good driving experience from a golf cart,  I may have bought a new car by now. But with all the useless and overcomplicated bullshit on cars these days, I wont ever touch one. Like my grandfather always said: if you own it, you better know how to fix it.

It might sound wrong because we have all the informations in our pockets but just because we can easily get important and correct information doesn't mean we do. It shows with our car choices.

I've said that it has front wheel drive only and the same ground clearence as my quattro but less space inside so let's have a competition, they didn't want to because the most important argument for the Kuga was that the wife liked the looks of it. That's all there is to SUV's, they are fashion items and people buying them like those stupid pants that looks like denim but they have a rubber on the end of the legs... My other friend bought 5 years old Audi last year. He was so proud because it is such a good looking car with very economical and yet quite lively diesel. But then one day he was in a supermarket car park and he pressed \"hand\" brake button a few times in a row and the brake stuck in locked because the button stopped working. He had to leave the car there for the night. The next day guy came with a computer and set the car free... I mean to the servis. \nI don't know much about electronics but in my opinion it doesn't last forever without issues. Especially in cars where it shakes and gets cold, hot or wet.

I am a Chevy guy and I’ll say that GM is the undisputed king of doing that. You have the GTO and the GT-40 (turbos everywhere) and the Impala and the Charger and the SS and now the new Bronco and the new Blazer. These companies are capitalizing on nostalgia just to sell us a mediocre vehicle. I mean I used to have a Blazer ZR2 and as someone in rural KS that was a fantastic vehicle for gravel roads and mud and deep snow and it could off road with the best. The new Blazer is literally being marketed as the exact opposite of it’s predecessor. I don’t have any better hope for the Bronco either. I hope that the new Bronco will be a capable off road vehicle but I seriously doubt it.

An SUV is a Truck underneath, with a full frame, a solid rear axle, leaf springs, torsion bars, big ground clearance. It can go offroad, it can haul trailers, etc. Most of these things are crossovers, they are for all intents and purposes overgrown station wagons with slightly more ground clearance, they have unibody construction etc. Because the manufacturers realize 90% of the people buying these things will never actually go off road or haul anything heavy, and that all these people really care about is fuel economy and cargo capacity. As for why the hate, because people like me who prefer to drive a car most of the time, that doesn't have shit handling for extra cargo capacity, that I could get just as easily in a wagon, we get sick of not being able to see anything in front of us because there's always someone in a crossover in front, and 90% of the time, there is no need for it and they are just taking up space and reducing visibility of the people who don't want to get on the crossover bandwagon, I bet half these people only own a crossover so they can see past all the other fucking crossovers.

Growing up in the 80’s I remember thinking how cool it was when I got my fist electronic dash on my Cutlass supreme and the cool shaped ‘Plastic’ everything inside and out of my new 94 Z-28 with the LT1. I was working as a crew member for a National Airline and  I could not wait until what was next.  Now I hate all of it !\n\n I don’t need a electronic device to tell me that I need air in my tires for example. It’s just one more thing that can go wrong and cost a lot of money to fix,  otherwise you got to sit there and look at the blinking light on your dash.  They really are looking more and more like  cockpits of an Airbus and spacecrafts. That’s the trend today that the generation wants and that’s what we’re stuck with. Or, if you’re lucky like I was.  Buy a car that’s about 10 years old (One owner, garage kept, very low mileage)  that has  just about enough technology in it to make it enjoyable to ride and keep it up.   Use to be that in America things were built to last and they did,  but slowly we became a disposable society.  If you remember when gas grills were all the rage and now you can get one for 100 bucks and within a year or two it’s rust and you toss it out. This is now becoming a trend with cars really.

Most cars do it this way, which means that when the headlight is on it's hard to see the turn signal. This has been common for a while, but getting worse as headlights get smaller and more intense, the module smaller thus the lights closer together. What's the obvious solution? Separate them by a few inches. But do car makers do the logical thing? NEVER! Instead they wire it to turn off the headlight when the turn signal is on.

I'm one who tends to see the Bug as having the best solution to almost everything. This wouldn't really work so well on a newer vehicle, as they don't have fenders to put them on top of, and just putting them on the sides of the hood would look hideous - as seen on the Toadmobile (which Nissan refers to as the Juke). I can't think of a particularly good place to put them on more modern cars, probably best is low down below the headlights - not as optimal, but at least it's not right next to the headlight. Maybe low down, but also have some beside the headlights visible from the sides, and on the mirrors - that's very visible from an oncoming direction and plenty far from the headlights, without looking terrible.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Quill Maurer"}

Toyota's latest styling, adding to this an excessive jaggedness. As for the complexity of engines, we're in the awkward last hurrah of gasoline powered cars, we all know the future is electric - which is much simpler in every way. Thus it will get better, but not in simplifying gas engines. That will likewise eliminate the transmission entirely. I think it's really silly when a new technology eliminates the need for this or that, but it's still kept because consumers are used to it - if you're using new tech, roll with it, flaunt it, don't hide it! This is true for the \"shift points\" on a CVT, as well as fake blocked-off grills on electric cars. On that note, would it be possible to make a manual CVT, instead of having notches one puts the gearshift into they can slide it fore and aft or something to change the ratio, without having to use a clutch - I think that could make for some interesting driving techniques. Either mechanically actuated, or electronic but with the driver controlling instead of ECU. As for the smaller windows - how could that make something \"safer?\" Maybe better protection in a collision, but I'd rather be able to see so that I don't get in the collision in the first place!

Good luck though if ever anything goes wrong as they're not cheap to fix. Just the clutch mechanism on a DSG alone will cost you dearly if you ever burn it or wear the plates out as many come as unserviceable assembled units.\n\nAlso, not all gearboxes are made the same. The original Smart was a slushbox that took forever to change gears. I've recently had the pleasure of driving a Canter truck with Duonic DSG gearbox and boy, was that a pile of junk. It was so slow to change gears it almost came to a stall going up some hills in Brisbane. I couldn't imagine that thing in a place like San Francisco. The clutch engagement was terrifying when trying to turn this thing around in a tight space as it couldn't engage the clutch smoothly. It reminded me of the Saab James May tried to park with its semi automatic gearbox.\n\nI don't hate automatics, I ride a semi automatic CUB and love the design.  Simple centrifugal clutch with predictable engagement, very reliable, compliant to use and simple mechanical design tied to a strong sequential gearbox.\n\nHowever, most cars nowadays are overly complicated in their design. You often end up fighting the gearbox when trying to get it to do what you want it to do. Why do we need so many darn drivemodes?\n\nExample: Subaru's Forester is crippled when going offroad by its gearbox management and you need to use settings that are against the manufacturer recommendations to successfully climb hills some hills.﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "djpalme"}

You don't have to worry about exhaust pipes or gasoline or changing the oil or adjusting the valves or getting a new timing belt etc etc. So, electric cars have incredible potential to simplify cars and actually increase their performance.

With young dumb kids, mostly women. I have seen that they get into a skid mid winter and don't have the skill to correct. Even though fwd is point the wheels away from the object you're about to hit, and floor it catch traction.

Because a majority pushes for eviromental control (1 Prius = 10, 3500 dodge dualies emmissions) ice engines won't be V8's much longer which is retarded. We already got rid of I6 engines. Why is it bad we get rid of race inspired engines? Because the reliability of customer cars goes down. I own a Silverado (6.2L), a elantea gt sport (1.6T), and have a 2J being built on a stand for the elantra. Why swap an engine 1 year into ownership? Emissions make the gdi engines fill up the cylinder bores with carbon, and the maintenance to keep the 1.6 running for 5 years is the same for a 2j swap, rwd conversion with custom tube work for the front and read subframes. \nWe need to have some mechnics design the cars from now on. Fuck engineers, they are the retards who make everything fit just barely. Yet since they are engineers youd thunk they are smart enough to either remove uneeded drivera aids, or reposition some components to make everything fit. \n\n\nWorst design ive seen for a so called simple repair on most cars. Clutch master cylinder on any genisis coupe. You need to remove the drive shaft, 2 motor mounts, angle the engine down and trans remove the trans, then go to the rear of the car to remove the master cylibder which is also up and to the left of the rear diff. After getting to the cylinder you need to remove 3 bolts and struggles usijg different angles to remove the part. \n\nFucking why, why not just put the master cylinder next to the BMC?

Look down the line of Lexus or BMW or Audi or any of the others and you may lose your lunch. Audi's a little better than the others but they're so gland and so kitschy as to be unacceptable. There's too many gimmicks and add-ons that manufacturers use inside and out to make people think that the car is incredible. So, the number one worst thing these days is styling or the lack thereof. The second worst thing is ergonomics. So many factors are starting to get this right such as Porsche with their touch screens which are excellent, but Lexus across the line continues with the worst design of ergonomics in the history of modern man. I own a Lexus, so I really know this to be the case. The third worst thing these days is that you cannot purchase a car with a manual transmission. There are many Enthusiast out there like myself that would prefer in most cases to drive a car with a manual transmission. There is nothing like a manual transmission, and a PDK or one of those other newfangled automatics are not the same. I'm talking about a manual transmission with the clutch pedal. The force major drawback to cars these days is what you mentioned, way too much Electronics! Nobody can work on these cars anymore because you pop open the hood and all you see is a giant big piece of plastic and underneath that there is a million vacuum tubes and electrical lines and just a complete disaster and cluster bang of nonsense.

A stability system that can’t be turned off. \n\nI drove it and I love it. Excellent vision all around ( save the rear view). In spite of being the safest car on the road. Instant torque like nothing else I have experienced with only a 1 speed transmission. \n\nEvery thing that is wrong with most modern cars Tesla somehow got right. So like 108,000 people before me and over half a million people still waiting for a sedan  .... not an Cuv. I am getting a Tesla 3. \n\nI won’t be saving the world quite yet ( I think the Cherokee and the 3 cancel each other out).﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "fatboy19831"}

Technology moves so fast and new advances keep coming out, but the auto makers are now making it harder and harder for owners of older vehicles to upgrade their vehicles to keep up with modern technology, some of which is safety related.\n\nI also agree with the always-on instrament illumination and the vehicles going down the street at night with their lights off. This one started with luxury and high-end Vehicles going back 20 years or so. If you're going to put an always-on instrument cluster in a vehicle, the lights have to be fully automatic, just because they're so many mindless zombies on the road pretending to be drivers.\n\nThat's another pet peeve of mine. there are far too many mindless zombies on the road who do not want to drive a car, truck, SUV, or any other vehicle, but feel that they must to be able to get from point A to point B.

We cannot afford health insurance for me, so if I get so much as just an accident and break my leg, I'd have to be left for dead on the side of the road, as the medical costs would be too outrageous and the debt would ruin our lives and make us wish to be dead either way. \n\nAnd for transportation , I am very lucky right now that I was able to even get a cheap clunker for under $1,500 to get me to work and college, before this, I had nothing, I had no way to get out to college to further my education to increase the amount I'm paid, I would have had no way to travel for job opportunities outside of a couple local convenience stores, which needless to say wouldn't be enough to live off of. If there were a simple bus service here and an Amtrak station put in, I could easily reach the city and have my job opportunities expanded and a way to much college from the existing bus services in the city.

The problem with socialist programs is that when implemented, it becomes argued that it isn't enough. Afterwards, people beg for the gov't to do more and more. Rather than having a gov't agency provide charity, it is far more appropriate for an actual charitable organization to provide charity. They normally have less corruption and are less wasteful with their resources. I've seen many charitable organizations help less fortunate people with cars (acquisition and repairs). As far as health insurance, most employers provide plans as a benefit. I've seen some of the best and worst in the different jobs that I've held. I have even left jobs for better benefits. The worst thing that has happened has been the ACA. It actually raised my plan cost because of the regulations.

However, like I said, there should at least be a minimum provided to allow people a jump-start in life. As you said about employer provided healthcare, what good would that do someone without a way to get to a job without it? And what good would it do for someone who ends up getting a disability that doesn't put them fully out of work but limits them to part time jobs? When you're born into a low income family, you're pretty much going to remain stuck there with no social mobility, can't afford a car to get to higher paid work? Too bad, enjoy barely making ends meet at a local convenience store or McDonalds. \n\nI do also agree that there are many bad charities that just take the money and run, there's many, maaany out there like that, which is exactly why it's suggested that the government do it. Sure it's not perfect, but it's kept more in check and is often obliged to release financial reports, while a private charity can withhold them to not show their greediness.\n\nFor the ACA, I will also agree it's terrible, we've been affected by it too, it pushed health insurance out of the affordable range for us, and now we're stuck paying that extra fine that comes with not having health coverage. It's terrible for people like you, and it was terrible for people like me, it was overall terrible. This is however, exactly why there's calls for true taxpayer paid healthcare with plans such as Medicare for All having been proposed. It cuts out the health insurance deal completely, the hospitals don't change, it just simply becomes taxes pay the bill (and yes, I'd be fine with a tax increase, because there's nothing exactly wrong with higher taxes.

With out the occasional tune up, an old car would break down and leave you stranded.

And because of all the electronics, cars can compensate for wear as the vehicle ages. Not even mentioning the car's ability so self-diagnose, cars today are much more reliable than they were in the past. I get the logic of simple means reliable, but car's are not simple.

At the same time, the new regulations prohibited any decorative or protective element in front of the headlamps whenever the headlamps are switched on. Glass-covered headlamps, used on e.g. the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted and vehicles had to be imported with uncovered headlamps for the US market. This change meant that vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.”\n\n“In 1983, granting a 1981 petition from Ford Motor Company, the US headlamp regulations were amended to allow replaceable-bulb, nonstandard-shape, architectural headlamps with aerodynamic lenses that could for the first time be plastic. This allowed the first US-market car since 1939 with replaceable bulb headlamps: the 1984 Lincoln Mark VII. These composite headlamps were sometimes referred to as \"Euro\" headlamps, since aerodynamic headlamps were common in Europe. Though conceptually similar to European headlamps with non-standardized shape and replaceable-bulb construction, these headlamps conform to the SAE headlamp standards of US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, and not the internationalized European safety standards used outside North America. Nevertheless, this change to US regulations largely united headlamp styling within and outside the North American market.”\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp﻿", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Rollo Larson"}
