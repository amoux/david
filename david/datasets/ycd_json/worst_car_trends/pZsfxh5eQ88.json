I am not against electric cars, I think it's a great future technology, but it's not a technology that is ready for the present day, and it's not needed. \n\nA range of 300 miles? That sounds awesome, until you realize they are talking about potential maximum range on a perfectly smooth test track, and so long as you keep the engine at optimum RPM the whole way, you don't go up hills, you don't turn on your lights or heating or anything else, and don't drive anywhere cold.  And building these cars is paid for more by the taxpayer than the manufacturer; it's a subsidy based industry.\n\nEngine efficiency in electric cars is inferior to gasoline vehicles; about 30% for a typical budget car compared to 25% for an electric car. And batteries are heavy. Gasoline is pretty light, and you can run the car on a 1/4 tank. Who is going to pay for the fast-charging stations? We are going to need a hell of a lot of them. More taxpayer subsidies? And what about power stations? We will need lots of nuclear power stations built to provide electricity for all these tens of millions of electric cars? \n\nAnd even if you think carbon emissions are bad (they're not) electric cars generate more carbon than regular cars, plus several very toxic chemicals used for production.Ôªø", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Hercule Holmes"}

{"cid": "UgyiJqO2nMqwC5hfmt14AaABAg", "text": "Self driving cars will not be a thing until \"human error\">(non self driving cars) are eliminated, or else the whole concept is dead. I mean whats the point of making self driving cars if they cannot even think fast enough and make assumptions. Google is making them only because they want more people to use google. I mean what else would you be doing in those things besides social media. Tesla is a battery company advertising and developing batteries to store renewable energy for domestic use. And Cadillac's CT6 is just being a cadillac and using new technology. Back to the point, in order for there to be actual functioning driverless cars that eliminate human error, they have to all be driverless at the same time. This means that some how the government is gonna have to get rid of all non driverless cars at one time. And they will need to pay a ton of money to redesign roads. And either give everyone driverless cars or make people pay for them. This will piss everyone off so, no. there won't be driverless cars that prevent \"human error\" unless they are used as driverless \"cruse controls\". Or an artificial intelligence that everyone can afford to have in their car. Oh and one more thing computers malfunction! there will probably be a lawsuit if that causes a fatality. :P\n\nJust imagine it you are in your perfect driverless car going like, 60 mph. drinking your coffee. It starts to rain and a wire gets exposed to it because of, you know wear and tear. Theres a corner coming up and the car slowly eases the throttle. THEN zap the wire shorts out and the front wheels get locked up. you reach for the driving wheel! wait there is none. RRRRAA SKID BANG THUD!!! (Screams)6 seconds later you are at the bottom of the cliff DEAD. Well at least you avoided a small \"fender bender\" like 2 years back.XDÔªø", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "DatBoi correa"}

{"cid": "UghT28JNgfu0kHgCoAEC.8O88PcuVrvk8OZsftH46v1", "text": "That's something really annoying here in the US. Hell, I love pickup trucks and SUVs, actually my daily driver is a 1998 Chevrolet K2500HD Extended Cab Long Bed with the L65 turbo-diesel, but since I live out in the countryside, at the end of a dirt road that will get your vehicle bogged down in heavy rain, and not to mention I don't haul asses around but my need to carry/tow heavy/large loads is constant, I consider myself different from those posers. You know, I would even appreciate them even more if they are either used for work, or off-roading. I feel disgusted looking at the \"higher-end\" pickup trucks/SUVs and their price tags. If I want a luxury car, I would save up (you only need your determination) and buy a goddamn Bentley Mulsanne Speed, which is my dream luxury ride. Much more class, luxurious, beautiful, purposeful, quality, and quieter than any high-end trim pickup trucks/SUVs, not to mention diesel-grade torque at low engine speed and sports car performance.\nThe fact that the EPA or the goverment doesn't ban using SUVs/pickup trucks like normal cars is ridiculous. I mean, come on, most SUVs and 1/2-ton pickup trucks are gasoline-powered, and they drink lots of gas and emit lots of harmful emission compared to a sedan due to their weight and engine size, and yet they put more emission control stuff like EGR and DPF to our diesel engines, which are mainly used on commercial/industrial vehicles, which are work vehicles. I understand the purpose of emission control and I support it, but they should begin at the right place. And that's one more reason I love older pickup trucks/SUVs: no electronic driver aids (ABS, ESP, traction control, etc.) and manual transmissions are standard, not to mention the use of solid axle front and rear (both 4x2 and 4x4, though this is generally before 1990s). They are a more accurate reflection of their purposes, far different from their modern successors.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Vinh Loc Quach"}

By the way, hybrids in general are a semi-measure as far as \"nature protection\" goes, for the simple reason of being much heavier than a \"normal\" car of roughly equivalent power output. The latest Prius I 've heard of has an average combined output of 86Nm and 65Ps (pay attention, I'm mentioning its AVERAGE values) for a weight of more than 1200Kg (I don't remember the exact number though), which means very weak acceleration rates, therefore a lot of trouble in trying to keep fuel consumption down. A more powerful car, let's say for example a Caterham CSR260 (average output 197Nm and 135Ps for a three-figure weight) is far easier to drive economically without being a hurdle to other drivers.

Proof for this is that the Tesla killed a man in a situation in which no driver on Earth paying attention would've crashed. And then Tesla comes and says \"autopilot is already better than human drivers\", linking to an overall crash statistic while being unable to actually prevent a crash, being one of the safest cars on the road for reasons that have nothing to do with autopilot, counting on human intervention to save the car should something happen(and if something happens, they'll probably say the human was in control, even if they took it at the final moment), and only driving on the highway, where, as we all know, accidents don't tend to happen very often. A.K.A. Misleading PR bullshit from Tesla there.\n\nAlso the Google self driving car would've caused A LOT of accidents, but was saved by the intervention of the human drivers, and then they post their data proudly saying their car made only 1-2 accidents and trying to mislead people and make them think they're not responsible. Look it up.\n\nI partially agree on long drives, but not actually driving can make you more prone to falling asleep, and not being able to intervene in the event the car needs you, which will most likely happen on a long road.Ôªø", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "And"}

Its hard to take a channel (Car Throttle) that claims to be in the car scene seriously when you don't even understand this basic modification. Back in the day people use to bend the fender wells out to keep the tires from rubbing. Stretching is just another way to avoid bending the sheet metal and or cutting it to install fender skirts on a set of wider/larger rims. Although, I have seen people use various combinations of bending the fender wells, adding fender skirts and or stretching the tires in order to drive without the tire rubbing.

You must be a defensive driver where ever you go, never trust the person next to you to drive safely. Like a gun, never rely on a manual safety, you just don't know when it might fail you someday. Could be next Thursday, could be 8 months, could be 8 years, or it might never happen. Its all a guessing game. If I had sensors on my car, great, but I'd never take them too seriously. Driving defensively and being aware of who's around you does this job better and keeps you alive.¬†Ôªø", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Dustin DaHusky"}

Even IF every new car in the future is capable of driving itself, not everyone will want to use it. And many people will still have older cars. For instance, I drive a 31 year old pickup that still runs on a carburetor. It's a smooth, quiet, comfortable cruiser of a pickup that I use more than the other vehicles, especially for long distance. \n\nIf I WANT a pickup with 4-wheel drive, tuned EFI, high-energy ignition, heavy-load wheels, and able to rip stumps out of the ground... then I take the other pickup. I'm in no hurry whatsoever to get rid of my NICE truck. It was parked in a shed for 20 years and still looks like new. And it's tuned so well I can start it by just reaching in the window and turning the key. \n\nAnd I frankly don't give a damn that brand-new vehicles have all sorts of new features and doodads added to them, more and more every year it seems. If and when I ever decide that these long lists of added crap are actually useful, instead of just a rainbow wig to grab everyone else's attention, I'll get one of those vehicles then. Though I'm certainly not going to go buy a new car just because it has new audio inputs, or now you can play video games on a display screen, or now there's a heating element under your butt inside the seat. The vehicles I have are already quite nice, and are very useful at comfortably driving across town. What more do I need?Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "KOakaKO"}

I already know what I like, and your opinion means less to me than a grain of sand. \n\nAnd I especially have no use for the cars you like either, children, because some of us use our vehicles in places where stoplights don't exist, and likely never will. \n\nFor instance, I don't need or want your little shitbox battery-powered toy cars, because when I drive 600 miles on the weekend (far, far away from petty and useless city children) I consider it pretty pointless and stupid to spend 16 hours waiting for it charge it's batteries a couple of times before I can get back home.Ôªø", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "KOakaKO"}

Im personally getting my liscence sometime this year and am currently trying to either get a manual import for cheap like a 240sx or a classic car (the one it looks like I might be getting is a 1973 cutlass with an automatic transmition). I have loved cars ever since I was a kid and even got to ride in some of my favourites that my dad fixed up for his boss at work, my favourite was a 1966 chevelle ss with a 350. I currently do not care for driving the vehicles that I currently have or I have to use (a 2011 dodge grand caravan) but once I get my own I plan to work on it and will most likely enjoy driving. The sad thing is that I can see this hapeneing too, the government usually will try to enforce laws that will prevent death, but I personally think that it would be ridiculous to ban the driving of vehicles without computer guidance. It really is sad too, I would love to take my drivers test in my dad's 1990 chevy silverado but the view is \"obstructed\" by a hair thin crack in the wondshield so I cannot use that, and if that can deem a car unfit for the road then I would hate to see what would happen to their standards when self driving cars become a thing (even though nobody really cares about the more minor problems a car may have). But basically I would hate the government if they ever made that law a thing and I would most likely move to another place that allowed me to drive, even though it would probably be pretty easy to out run an automated police car by going offroad.Ôªø", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Chevy Johnson"}

That is why there is so much stuff banned in formula 1 as far as computer aids.  Theoretically, you could give autonomous cars ability to communicate with traffic lights to know when they will change, have cars slow down, or speed up if they are in that zone where we normally decide whether to give it gas and get through a yellow, or mash the brakes.  The cars could know ahead of time when the light will change and adjust accordingly for a slight increase in speed or a more gradual stop.  So the reasoning behind why an autonomous car could be legal while driving one handed talking on a cell phone isn't is because computers are better.  If you need anymore convincing, think of it like this.  A computer can run calculations thousands upon thousands of times and second and make decisions based on that for the best outcome, but it will never get distracted by its mum talking on the phone with it about how the neighbors dog shit in her yard.  But people get distracted, its very easy for a person to lose focus and stop making decisions about driving and make decisions about numerous other things; radio volume or station, climate controls, what the asshole in the other lane is doing.  When that happens, we make mistakes and it is a very easy thing for a person to do because our decision making speed is far slower then a computer.  Computers won't be better then us at everything, but driving is organized enough to the point where self-driving cars will do it better then us, and in a world where everyone had a self-driving vehicle, accidents would be almost non-existent with cars, lights, everything communicating together, only freak occurrences, like a natural disaster would likely lead to them, and that is what would give job security to steering wheels.  Steering wheels would never be gone entirely because of such freak events that we may still have to override the car for, but those are few and far between.Ôªø", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "KlockworXMusic"}

It is an unfortunate inevitability for us car guys, as much as it pains me to say.  Already Mercedes and Audi are offering semi-autonomous cars for 2017, and autopilot features will be available for low priced cars by 2020. It will still take about 10-15 years for every car on the road to have some sort of autonomous capability. Most cars will probably still be somewhat driveable ( IE you can switch the autopilot off) until 2030-2040. Depends on how quickly people take to the technology. However, this puts into question the future of driving yourself.If it isn't outright banned at some point in the future, it will be unaffordable to the common man, as the insurance for driving your car manually will be too expensive. manually driven cars will rise in value, pricing them out of the reach of middle class America. Like horse racing, our hobby is destined to become a thing for the rich, and relegated to racetracks and private road courses. I would HOPE we can still drive forever, i would love to keep driving and working on my classic cars as long as I live because I LOVE driving.

communicating within a few blocks of anything around it though to have any chance at beating a human. ¬†Everything thinks computers are so fast and smart and can do anything we tell them too, but they are very limited in some regards. ¬†Humans are far better at a lot of things, but if we narrow that down to general areas, there are 3 things we can kick the living shit out of computers at; unstructured problem solving, acquisition and processing of new information, and most importantly, non-routine physical tasks, which includes driving. ¬†\n\nUnstructured problem solving is solving problems when rules are not clearly laid out, there are exceptions or rules are non-existent. ¬†In driving, this can be modeled with something as simple as 2 people come to a 4 way stop and stop at the same time. ¬†We normally know that the person to the right goes first then. ¬†But this is a rough rule, in a computers world, we can be talking thousandth of a second, they would need to communicate to have that accuracy, otherwise based on sensors like ultrasonic or infrared range finders to figure if they or the other car stopped first would be inaccurate. ¬†The inaccuracy would mean that both cars could think they got there first and start driving. ¬†They would need to communicate so that at least the implement the rule \"The person to the right goes first\".\n\nNext is acquisition and processing of new information. ¬†Humans do this incredibly well. ¬†Computers, not so much surprisingly to many. ¬†When we look around we see people, and it doesn't matter what they are wearing, or if they are in costume, we know when its a person. ¬†We understand what is a shadow, whats not, we have actually not the best depth perception (we judge things better side to side then forward or backwards) but we do it well enough that in fog or heavy snow fall that we can't see very far and slow down. ¬†Computers using camera recognition suck at this comparatively and would be at a disadvantage. ¬†Having vehicles communicate would mean they wouldn't necessarily need to see the other vehicles to know where they are, besides that you wouldn't have to store a massive database of things on every car, it could be online. not only that, when a car sees something new, it could be added to the data base so every car could use that data. ¬†I mean, a self-driving vehicle will at some point (and will likely have it happen with some frequency) come across something completely new to it.\n\nNow the big one, Non-Routine Physical Work. ¬†This usually consists of very low skilled work as far as humans are concerned, like cooking. ¬†When we cook, its not a hard task, irritating maybe because some of us are lazy, but difficult no. ¬†But its non-routine, and we don't really realize it probably. ¬†We make changes to temperature, stirring, flipping, cook times, all sorts of variables even for the same dish we have made before based on how it is cooking, whether we taste it or it starts to burn a bit, etc. ¬†For a computer, this high degree of variance completely hands it its robotic ass. ¬†It has to tell if something is burning, if its fully cooked, if the temperature is too high for something that is maybe cream based, variances in the temperature of the cooking element (most ovens and ranges vary by 30 degrees or more above and below what you set them too, we don't even think or realize this and cook just fine a computer watching the temperature fluctuate that much would be doing massive calculations to get the timing right). ¬†Driving is the same way, we take driving for granted as a very simple task, and for us it is. ¬†But the way a computer works it is very difficult. ¬†When we drive along, if we see kids playing with a soccer ball in the front yard, we know to watch for them, or if a soccer ball is kicked into the road we know what it is and what is likely to happen AFTER it (A child comes running out after it) and we stop. ¬†A computer sees a soccer ball, recognizes it as an obstacle, slows or tries to avoid it, but it will likely not think ahead that a child might come running out. ¬†Yes, you could program it so whenever it sees a ball on the road surface that it stops incase a child jumps out too, but someone has to program that, and then you get into all sorts of what if this happens that need to be programmed into. ¬†And that is really what it comes down to, we learn and make decisions quickly for non-routine things, think ahead, a computer can make far faster decisions, but for routine things that happen over and over again without having to learn new things or think ahead of what will happen next, which is why in production robots are great, robotic arms fitted to weld cars on assembly lines are great, they do the same weld in the same spot the same way each time, computers are great for that. ¬†Things where there are infinite possibility of things that could and at some point will happen, and having to decide on that takes massive processing power. ¬†And again, communicating cars would help this, a car in front recognizes a ball rolling toward the street as it passes by and warns the vehicles behind it to slow down and be alert. ¬†So again, vehicles would work orders of magnitude greater being able to communicate, if they can't they will likely be no better and probably worse then us at driving, or might match us at slow speeds (We could take major highways to drive from LA to NY, but the self driving car only drives better then me on slower roads so we are only going to take roads with speed limits of 40mph or less so I don't have to drive).Ôªø", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "KlockworXMusic"}

So no one is going to look into a BMW self driving car, because its a BMW its probably to expensive for me anyway, and it would be forgotten but Tesla is a new company that doesn't have any preconceived notions about it. Its only known for one thing. Even if its expensive (which it is) that doesn't matter because most people won't immediately make that connection as they would with a luxury brand, so they look into it, and generate buzz about it. Also you have to consider that with the Tesla its a very unique car. A self driving BMW? thats cool, a self driving Tesla thats all electric and has the equivalent of 500HP?

Celebrities driving these around, saying \"its the way of the future!\" was actually a pretty funny spectacle. Lastly, the nail in coffin for the people i knew - research at the time showed that the hybrid craze was actually doing a lot worse for the environment, as was more costly to maintain... too many arguments based on things that didn't consider the life cycle of the old batteries.... and there we go. for all those who didn't know xD At least they seem to be getting better...
