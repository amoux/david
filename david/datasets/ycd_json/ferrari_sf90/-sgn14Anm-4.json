This probably undercuts the need of a slim area underneath the sodepods which is used to channel the flow inside the lateral structure. That large structure also prevents the ouwash to come too early into the sides of the car.\n3-pushing hard to let the outwashed air come into the coke bottle area more violently and orderly.

Are you referring to that time when Ferrari were bitching about the tyres and then Vettel tested both sets and he admitted he was wrong? Oil burning was Ferrari. You forgot how they delayed their new engine so they could keep burning oil. You also forgot about their flexible wings and when Vettel crashed into stroll to avoid getting caught with his illegal car after the race. Or when they turned a blind eye when he cussed out Charlie on the radio and so on. The FIA are fairly impartial as far as I'm concerned but if they show any bias it's probably towards Ferrari.

Those special tyres were only for a few races, but the average driver asked to have them in all races and that's what he got. Regarding oil burning, it was adrian newey that first point that Mercedes are burnig oil back in 2015. At the time, Allison had Ferrari in tye toilet. \n\n\nAnd for the token rule, the most shameful rule in the history of F1 designed to stop others from catching up. Illegal suspension that FIA was fully aware of, and they banned it as soon as Ferrari wanted to use it. illegal mirror that FIA didn't allow Ferrari to use, but let Mercrdes run it. Same goes with the illegal wheels that FIA is yet to clear it. I expect it to be banned because Ferrari are using it.\n\n\nOn top of all, FIA leaking Ferrari's tech secret to a point that in the heavily policed and censored F1 Arrivabene warned FIA against leaking their tech info. The entire 2014-2017 when everyone was sufferings from tyres, FIA didn't give a shit and produced tyres to help the average low-IQ circle alone around race tracks. The scam is so huge that Mercedes can get away with illegal tyre test that gave them massive advantage over others. Mercedes keep hiring Ferrari rejects just to get inside info because they trust their home-grown engineers are not competent enough to make an ERS as good as Ferrari. In ract, Ferrari's ERS/Battery was cleared in 2014, it became a problem when the average low-IQ driver couldn't circle alone around the tracks and his team lost massive advantage after the shameful token rule was lifted.\n\nIn fact, low-IQ man is so below average that he got his average ass comprehensively handed to him by another average driver like Rosberg. \n\n\nMercedes is never inspected by FIA, they don't monitor Mercedes car to the level they do Ferrari or other teams. My friend, good thing is that the history is recorded and we know what you Brits have done. Calling someone a 'French midget' can only come from a delusional Brit fan. There has never been a bigger scam in a competition in history. #2014-2018SCAM\n\n\nIf there was any glory in cheating, manipulation and immoral activities, you'd be the champion of it and history tells us so.", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Remi R"}
