In fact, i barely heard of them before last weekend. So, far this tutorial is extremely beginner friendly and i really appreciate that. However, I do have two questions at this time. 1. after the Hello World tutorial you began the drawing shapes tutorial on a blank screen. Did you just delete the Hello world world tutorial info, or did you start a new project? \nI just deleted it as I wasn't sure.\n2. Before you run/play the Drawing shapes  viseo you say to save it, but i didn't see you save it. how do you do that? Did u just mean through file, save as(like all other computer documents are saved..or i s there a special way in this program)?\n3. I forgot i had another question lol. Is there python keyboard shortcuts to things like double parenthesis, etc. the things that you use often or are you just super fast at it because you do it so often?﻿", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "OFF THE RECORD Fashions"}

Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.\n\r\nPython features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n\r\nPython interpreters are available for many operating systems.

I think I have a framework to solve world hunger... if you took  how many people are on the planet, avg height, avg weight... etc and the foods that produce the greatest amount of usable energy the space needed/available per calorie or calorie per square inch along with many other factors to create an algorithm that gives you a list of the say top 100 foods that could accomplish this goal. Then if everyone was on board you could customize optimal diet plans per person per country using available resources, customs, foods again a variety of other factors you in essence lay out the plans to stop world hunger honestly I think the savings in waste an distribution would largely pay for the implementation process.... mic drop lol this is a very narrow example I admit an have many more ideas but by plugging in the right information and programming to support it you could very well do this in my lifetime﻿", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Larissa Kells"}

In German it's called vokal but I don't know if it's the same in englisch ;)) \nSo if your char is a vokal then you have to check if you original char ist uppercase or lowercase and this is checked with the function .isupper :\n\"A\".isupper() -> True\n\"a\".isupper() -> False\nSo if the Vokal is uppercase you append a uppercase G to your final string (translation) else you append a lowercase G. \n\nAnd if the observed character is not a Vokal, then you just append the character to your translation! \n\nIn the end you return your translation so you can work with it afterwards -> in this case you're printing it out! \n\nI hope I could help you and if you're having some additional questions feel free to ask again ;)﻿", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Xi Wang"}

Repeated squaring (and multiplication by the base) is better, e.g. x^18 = ((((x^2)^2)^2)*x)^2. For large exponents (e.g. when x is a floating-point number or you are doing modular exponentiation), this can make a huge difference.

I think it's sad that comment, as it means that coding is somehow associated with losers because they can't get a job, and have nowhere else to go. It has far more worth, and need, than that. I'm here doing it, because I want to understand it. When I do a story on why more girls should code, then maybe I should know what I'm talking about - what the limitations and benefits are for each generation, gender, and class/socioeconomic background. The problem with Buzzfeed is they got a bit excited about their lists, and there is a limit to how interesting that is. I know loads of journalists who refused to work there for that reason alone, as they like to follow and investigate a good story - they hunger for the truth. Journalists should absolutely code, and many already do. All kids should do math too, and read literature.

{"cid": "UgzgqaVsaNhPAdSDZUp4AaABAg", "text": "There is actually a bug at the word guess game at around 2:30:00. Even if the guess limit is 3, player will be given four chances, and the fourth guess will always be wrong even if the player inputs the right word. This is because if the last but one guess is wrong, guess count will be equal to guess limit after guess_count += 1 is executed. After this it will go to the loop condition and find that the condition is met, hence the player will again get a prompt to input a new word. However, since this time guess_count == guess_limit, out_of_guesses will be set as true and the program will end no matter what the input is. To fix his, add \"if guess_count == guess_limit: out_of_guesses = True\" after the \"guess_count +=1\" line.﻿", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Bai Junwei"}

Ultimately this means that Python is a very slow language to use compared to compiled languages such as C#, C++ and C.\n\nPython is great for in-house development, but it's not something you are likely to create a full application with to distribute. The exception to this is perhaps web-based applications which run on a server. so the overheads are less noticed. If you're planning on selling a game, making it in Python is pretty useless since anyone who runs it will need to run it through a Python interpreter.\n\nThere are \"compiled\" Python programs out there, but these are a bit of a red herring. What you're actually doing is slapping your code onto a distributed interpreter. It's like giving people both Python and your program at the same time. It's still interpreted at runtime, so the speed difference is minimal.﻿", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Crystan"}

Sure, we could declare a variable before the function and then use it inside the function, but it's easier to use parameters, the things that go inside the ().\nIf we wanted to throw in a variable that changes when we call the function, we would do it as follows:\ndef restaurant_greeting(meal_of_the_day):\n    print(\"Hello! Nice to see you today.\")\n    print(\"Today's special is \" + meal_of_the_day + \".\")\n    print(\"Enjoy your meal!\")\n\nSee where we have meal_of_the_day in the function? That's what will change depending on how we call the function, which is done like this:\nrestaurant_greeting(\"spaghetti and meatballs\")\nAnd it would show like this:\nHello! Nice to see you today.\r\nToday's special is spaghetti and meatballs.\r\r\nEnjoy your meal!\n\nIf the meal changes tomorrow, we can change it when we call the function. It allows for our variables to be, well, variable. Whatever we put in the parentheses when calling the function is called an argument to the function, and whatever is in the parentheses when we establish the function is called a parameter.\n\nWe can use multiple variables:\ndef restaurant_greeting(entree_of_the_day, dessert_of_the_day):\r\n    print(\"Hello! Nice to see you today.\")\r\n    print(\"Today's special entree is \" + entree_of_the_day + \", and our daily dessert is \" + dessert_of_the_day + \".\")\r\n    print(\"Enjoy your meal!\")\nThen we call the function with the variables in the same order we established them in:\nrestaurant_greeting(\"spaghetti and meatballs\", \"New York cheesecake\")\nAnd it would show like this:\r\nHello! Nice to see you today.\r\nToday's special entree is spaghetti and meatballs, and our daily dessert is New York cheesecake.\r\r\nEnjoy your meal!\n\nWe can set default arguments if not given an argument:\ndef restaurant_greeting(entree_of_the_day=\"not available\", dessert_of_the_day=\"not available\"):\r\n    print(\"Hello! Nice to see you today.\")\r\n    print(\"Today's special entree is \" + entree_of_the_day + \", and our daily dessert is \" +  dessert_of_the_day + \".\")\r\n    print(\"Enjoy your meal!\")\r\nIn the above example, we used \"not available\" to show that when the function was called, there were no arguments given, meaning there is no special entree or daily dessert.\n\nIf one of your parameters gets a default argument, all of them do. You can't have a default argument for the entree and not the dessert:\ndef restaurant_greeting(entree_of_the_day=\"not available\", dessert_of_the_day):\r\n    print(\"Hello! Nice to see you today.\")\r\n    print(\"Today's special entree is \" + entree_of_the_day + \", and our daily dessert is \" + )\r\n    print(\"Enjoy your meal!\")\r\nCalling this function with no arguments spits out this error:\nSyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument\nThis means you only have one default argument but two parameters.\n\nPlease, can I have some moderately versed python coders check my work?﻿", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Jacob Short"}
