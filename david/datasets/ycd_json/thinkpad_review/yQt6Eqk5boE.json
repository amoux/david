What is really the point of a good webcam.\nThe new touchpads with click anywhere and no physical buttons are complete crap for dragging. To distinguish between moving the mouse and dragging you have to push harder. The real bad boys play fps games on a touchpad, which is very tiring on these new touchpads. Also drawing or panning in graphics or CAD design is terrible. Left hand on wasd, left thumb on the physical button, and moving the cursor with your right hand works great. What's wrong with physical buttons? Nothing! They just work, period. And that's exactly what people need.\nA click anywhere touchpad is cool, and that is great for marketing, but that's it. Don't forget that a lot of CAD software uses the right or middle mouse button for panning and orbiting, because the left-click is already used for selecting and drawing. How could you do this without physical buttons? Panning around by putting 3 fingers on the touchpad? You'd have to turn off some stupid gestures first and secondly it's awkward as hell even if dragging with 3 fingers was supported by the driver.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "sasja de vries."}

The keyboard is the best that I have ever used on a laptop, and the screen is nice and bright, with a finish that is halfway between matte and glossy. I find myself using the nipple far more than I thought I would, and I find the stylus super-useful for drawing diagrams. I will both agree and disagree with you about fingerprint reader placement though. I think it depends on the type of reader. If it is a swipe-reader (like the one on my yoga), I would prefer it to be to the side of the trackpad (I like it where it is on the yoga, below the arrow keys), but if it is a tap-reader, it needs to be on or alongside the power button, as you say. Personally, because my thinkpad yoga has a swipe-reader, I have the palm of my hand enrolled as my index finger never seems to be reliable (probably because my fingers see a lot more wear than the palm of my hand).\n\nAs for pricing - find someone selling them brand new on ebay like I did (though YMMV - some sellers are better than others)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ByteOfBlender"}

A third concept beeing a cooling system based on passive heatsinks placed on the back of the laptop, in where a self pumping liquid could be used for heat transfer.\n\nDeveloping a universal external PCIe port, that allows the usage of much cheaper external docks for Graphics and other devices. And together with that, co developing compact laptops with powerful CPUs which unlock a higher TDP when docked to a cooling station; one that could simply use a cold plate contacting the underside of the laptop.\n\nI have millions of ideas.

{"cid": "Ugy-QgcVmzeInB67n-Z4AaABAg", "text": "Same marketing BS I'm used to seeing from modern Lenovo. Ethernet requires an adapter, the high resolution monitor is glossy, the audio controls are hidden behind Fn key combos and the lock keys have absolutely zero visual indication of being enabled, the touchpad lacks buttons, etc. They even have flipping soldered RAM on a ThinkPad now. It's like they're aiming so hard for the \"prosumer\" market that they have forgotten what the actual professionals want. This is nothing more than an attempt to milk the brand.\n\nSome of you will probably say \"you're being too harsh on Lenovo, they're just adapting to the market\". Again, marketing BS. I didn't commit to the ThinkPad series because they followed the trends, I did it because ThinkPads didn't follow the trends. It used to have those features consumers didn't want because it was in the way of their idea of what a laptop should look like.\n\nFor instance, the VGA port. Universally hated among gamers because it can't handle high resolutions with sharp horizontal pixels. But guess what, it always works. Always. I don't care if it's not optimal when I need to get an image from my computer to the projector wall right this second. It's hard for a projector to mess up analog RGB signals, even if one of them is missing I can still get most of the actual content out there as long as the green pin carries a sync pulse. Try that with HDMI, see how far it gets you in an environment where even the simplest of tasks can and will be done incorrectly. Oh and good luck protecting your laptop from an unshielded HDMI cable (no ground connection to equalize the charges before the differential pairs make contact), they are genuinely pure evil.\n\nNeither is it helping that reviewers are not giving Lenovo competent enough feedback to divert them from mistakes like these. You need to put the computers in an appropriate environment, even something like a comparison with a 10 year old ThinkPad would instantly reveal half of these faults. But don't take my word for it; listen to someone like Louis Rossmann and you'll get it.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Djhg2000"}

The (thick) Lenovo on the other hand has a keyboard that is a PLEASURE to use. Sure... the Macbook runs rings around the older machine and is a fraction of the thickness but there are still compromises from going TOO thin. I also find the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the Macbook to be more of a hindrance than a help most of the time and a few more mm to permit a USB-A connection really wouldn't hurt anyone.

Technology is advancing and having it \"thin\" and \"powerful\" is important for many of us. It's 2018. It's time to get with the times, man.\n\nThis is complete bullshit and utter crap.\n- First of all, there's a thing called physics that says \"you can't put a big thing in a small thing\", which in normal words means, you can't put a big battery in a tiny laptop. Thicker laptop with a 20+ hours battery life or thin laptop with a 3-5 hours battery life? I'd much rather have the battery life and be able to use my fucking laptop.\n- Second, that same \"physic\" thing says you can't put ports if the device is too thin.\nIf it can't have a full size ethernet and a VGA port, it's too thin. If you need to ask why VGA, you never used a laptop in a real business environment.\n- Third, guess what else physics have to say? Cooling needs space. You just can't have efficient cooling when everything is crammed tight. Do I need to explain why heat is bad for your device or is that basic enough?\n\nThin and powerful is nice in theory. Unfortunately, it's physically impossible.\nAnything that is thin and claims to be powerful is compromising everything else it can.\nCan't replace/upgrade anything, or lack of ports, or tiny battery life, or cooling issue, you name it.\n\nYou want something thin? It's okay, as long as you accept that it won't be powerful. And that's mostly okay, you don't need something powerful for web browsing or average office use.\n\nThere's \"going with the time\", and \"not being a fucking idiot\".", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Plasmaboo"}

The old core2duo smashed, destroyed the i7 in performance! Why? Because the core2duo t9900 is a dualcore cpu with 6mb of cache and 3.06ghz. The i7 that claims to be \"up to 3.1ghz\" actually runs at 1.8ghz and is also dualcore. A freaking dualcore i7!!! \nThis \"turbo\" that goes up to 3.1ghz, mostly never activates, you need to be on performance mode, connected to the outlet, cold as ice, with battery full, have turned on the laptop, hadnt any load before and even so, it will work on those lame \"duty cicles\" so it turns the turbo on for 2s (3.1ghz for 2 seconds) then turn of for 4s (1.8ghz for 4s) then turn on, and make this sometimes and the stick with 1.8 or maybe in some really good designed motherboards just continue with that cicle. So if you pick a game that require a old dualcore 2.2ghz processor or a dualcore 2.4ghz processor (wich old i3s, i5s, core2duos nail it, as the i5 2450m that is better basically than any i7 ulv (with u in the name) from the third to the 6gen! \n\nSo... No! These ultrabooks and thin devices are good for browsing the web, consuming media, but when you have to do anything, like any job, any non potato compatible program, game, even an old dell 1545 is better, than, for example the asus zenbook pro or a inspiron 15r 5537 or a xps 13...  \n\n\"But what about razer blade?

{"cid": "UgwHNUzCULh9UnMv4V54AaABAg", "text": "Here's my problem with lenovo, I don't care how \"premium feeling\" or \"long lasting\" the high end carbon series can be because realistically, very few businesses are going to buy super expensive laptops for their employees who are probably only running a few basic apps, checking their email, or browsing the web. If a business is going to provide an employee with a laptop, at most it may be a sub $800 thinkpad, and let me tell you, lenovos lower-end laptops are absolute garbage. Sure the keyboard and trackpad may not have changed much, but build quality is pretty bad and internal component and reliability wise, they are terrible. It gets worse, I expect most businesses to get the sub $400 or $500 thinkpad, and those things are horrific. I haven't even gotten to their IdeaPad lineup, there it's just embarrassing in build quality and longevity. Why am I saying this? Me and my family used to have done business with lenovo for years and we could see the quality of their laptops rapidly decrease over time. I wish tech youtubers like you would do \"home or work laptop roundups\" with a mediocre budget, and then compare some laptops. I know my family will not be buying a $2300 laptop for basic work.\nOh, and WHY ARE YOU COMPARING THIS TO THE DELL XPS LINEUP!!! You do realize that the Dell Latitude and Precision lineups are Dell's business lines right? Of course the missing features (SIM, Docking, ex) and the smaller price on the XPS are present, BECAUSE THE XPS IS NOT A BUSINESS LAPTOP.
