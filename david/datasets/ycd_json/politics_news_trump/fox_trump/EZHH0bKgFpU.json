It’s about power, and they are willing to do anything it takes to gain it. The thing is, it won’t last.

President Trump and his administration has done more for United States Citizens, in just two years, than any president in history. The rest of her statement with regard to President Trump, is all based on Cohen's word with no real hard evidence; including the reason given for the checks. The word of a convicted Liar. And she did violate House rules by implication, that a fellow member committed a racist act. And Mr. Meadows was only being fair to Mrs. Tlaib when he stated that he felt that she didn't intend do it. Even though it was clear that it was intentional, seeing how she was reading from her own notes. And when she read the statement back to the committee the second time it was not the same as when she read it the first time. The first time it was: \"- it is insensitive that someone would actually use a prop. A black woman in this chamber. In this committee, is alone racist in itself.\" The second time she omitted portions, rendering her statement somewhat confusing, and not as directional: \"-it is insensitive that someone would even say racist, they say it is racist in itself, to use a black woman as a prop, to prove it otherwise.\" And only when the chair queried her as to her intention, did she apologize. If this kind of accumulative behavior, from any member of government, is  allowed to continue, unchecked, it will become the norm, which can only lead to the abatement of the United States Constitution.

In The United States Supreme Court there are friezes depicting the 18 greatest lawgivers of the world. \n\nThe second frieze to the right features a person holding a copy of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. It is intended to recognize Prophet Muhammad as one of the greatest lawgivers in the world, along with Moses, Solomon, Confucius, and Hammurabi, among others.\n\nHere is what the Supreme Court’s website says about this frieze:\n\nMuhammad (c. 570 - 632) The Prophet of Islam. He is depicted holding the Qur’an. The Qur’an provides the primary source of Islamic Law. Prophet Muhammad’s teachings explain and implement Qur’anic principles. The figure above is a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor, Adolph Weinman, to honor Muhammad, and it bears no resemblance to Muhammad. Muslims generally have a strong aversion to sculptured or pictured representations of their Prophet.﻿", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "Craigs List"}

I also wouldn't plaster a picture of Jesus on a church wall. First of all, that Gesu Cristo representation doesn't align with scripture.

How can people then want to vote after 4 years the same corrupt carreer politicians in again to screw them for many years over again !? just mind boggling to me.If you guys dont want Trump we would love to have him as our president , finally someone who gets stuff done and who is for the people , not bought and paid working for Lobbyist groups.

Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.\n \nThe fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.\n \nFar from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome﻿", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "Vlasta Molak"}

She was STILL crying the last time about \"RACIST TRUMP SEPARATING CHILDREN AT THE BORDER!!!!\"... -_- They are absolute trash hypocrites. The first photos put out by FAKE NEWS of \"BORDER KIDS IN CAGES!!!\" were being called \"TRUMP'S RACIST SEPARATION OF KIDS AT THE BORDER AND THROWN IN CAGES!!!!\" YET those turned out to be photos from kids in cages during OBAMA'S TERMS!!! xD  Democrat regressives PUBLICLY supported \"the wall/fence\", taking measures to \"ERADICATE\" ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION!!!! when Obama Bin Laden was in office. Schumer signed onto providing nearly $50 billion dollars for \"border security\", nearly $10 billion of that went to the \"border wall/fence\" which was erected during Obama's terms. YET Democrat regressives only wanted to give President Trump ~$1.x billion for essentially the SAME type of wall/fence that was erected during Obama's terms, although the core of the columns was supposed to be made stronger.\n\n\nWhen Obama took office, Schumer's own words:\n“People who enter the US without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the US legally,”.\r\n“We must create a system that converts the current flow of low-skilled illegal immigrants into the United States into a more manageable and controlled flow of legal immigrants who can be absorbed by our economy,”.\r\n“Let me elaborate. The first of these seven principals is that illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple,”.\r\n“Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration,”.\r\n“When we use phrases like ‘undocumented workers’ we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration,”.\r\n“Above all else, the American people want their government to be serious about protecting the public, enforcing the rule of law, and creating a rational system of legal immigration,”.\n\n\nBUT somehow now, Democrat regressives seem to be unconcerned about \"illegal immigration\" and \"protecting the public, enforcing the rule of law...\" when Democrat regressives themselves have created \"sanctuary\" cities/states where they try to \"hide\" illegal aliens, including violent criminal illegal aliens from ICE. Democrat regressives have called for ICE to be abolished all of a sudden. Even when one of their own (a Democrat progressive) is murdered by an illegal alien, what did they have to say about it?! Well nothing really, Liz Warren said something tho, she said \"I'M SORRY FOR HER [MOLLIE] AND HER FAMILY BUT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM!\". So yes that young Uni student that shared their ideals meant nothing, her whole life taken from her BUT Democrat regressives like Warren want to focus on helping all of these illegal aliens ALLEGEDLY coming to the U.S. for \"asylum!!! because its so dangerous where we live and we need a job!!!\", as if Americans don't...

A Muslim who runs for secular government office is either not a good Moslem or is using Taqiyya, sacred deception, to advance Islam. By swearing an oath on the Qur'an, a book that declares the US Constitution is not the highest law of the land, it is an act of sedition.\n  You need to research more on the Qur'an, Hadiths, Sira, and Sharia so you will see the truth that Islam is a religion of war and deception against ALL Kafir (non-believers of islam).  It has one goal: make Sharia the law of the land worldwide.  Islam wants EVERYONE to kneel to allah & mohammad by invitation (Da'wah) or by the sword (once Sharia is the law of the land).﻿", "time": "10 hours ago (edited)", "author": "John Herlihy"}
