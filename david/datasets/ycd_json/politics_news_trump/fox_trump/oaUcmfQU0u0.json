They are also the party that cares about people who live in other countries, yet hate America and hate their own people.  They also, bizarrely, have turned on the working class.  Obama started the hatred of working class people, and of white people.  I am poor, and I, and every single one of my friends (all poor like me), were left worse off after Obama's presidency, yet he was supposed to be a man for the worker.  He was an elitist, a pawn for the Muslims and the EU.  He was going to sell us out with the TPP, and all the stuff he did with surveillance and war. . . he poured money into intersectional programs on campuses--he hated this country.  He was the one who started the \"being patriotic is racist,\" crap. He is arguably the worst president in history.﻿", "time": "19 hours ago", "author": "luna singer"}

What I would say is that all thinking people KNOW that 99% of our wonderful politicians are FILTHY, immoral, greedy, self-serving, dishonest, and utterly unconcerned about the citizens they are supposed to represent. So, knowing that, we were looking for the candidate most likely to at least TRY to clean up some of this mess. We knew that one of the primary necessities for that is to put a STOP to the millions of invaders swarming across our southern border--a goal which should not need an ounce of explanation, much less justification--because we have all known for decades that this is the way Communists (aka Dems) have been holding on to political power (votes) while they continue tearing the USA to pieces. The one thing we did NOT want was another career politician, nor a 'newcomer' like Obama, whom nobody knows or has any idea of their real character & intentions. We have known Donald Trump publicly for such a long time, we already knew about his most obvious flaws--so no thanks, Commies, we got it--therefore we felt there was a chance that if he were a monster we'd have gotten a whiff of it. In any case, every emotional outburst from the Left is PHONY TO THE MAX, they are incapable of feeling anything except hatred, seething resentment (at not ALREADY being in full control of the whole g.d. world), and perverted desires & tendencies. Since the entire media is 100% on board with all this, the truth is NEVER reported by them, and leftists are able to say and do things that they should be imprisoned or shot for, and all we get is crickets. A nation founded on a Constitution like ours should NEVER, not in a million years, EVER allow someone into office who can easily  be found to be unworthy, especially those whose entire identity is rooted in beliefs & 'values' completely in opposition to that Constitution. Yet, we have SEVERAL Muslims (that we know about) in political office right now, plus countless KNOWN Communists, and 'Socialists' (emerging Communists) are the DARLINGS of the Left & media. Those Dems who love to perceive themselves as 'the good guys' are not only dangerously deluded, they are helping to bring this country down just so they can feel good about themselves--for 'reasons' that do not stand up to the tiniest scrutiny.﻿", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "Dolphin Dream"}

It was presumed that somebody could have accessed her emails already, and we learned in congressional filings just last year that, in fact, there's evidence to show a carbon copy of each one of her private server emails had been obtained by a foreign entity.\n\nDonald Jr. met with a Russian lawyer who was a client of Fusion GPS, the same company hired to write the Trump Dossier. The Trump Tower meeting was a brilliant scheme by Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS to give his Russian client what she wanted (the opportunity to speak to someone who had the ear of the potential next president) and give Hillary Clinton what she wanted: Evidence of Trump \"colluding with the Russians.\" Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton and those protecting her, that meeting was largely unproductive, and the exchange of the alleged information would not have been a crime in the first place.\n\nAnd lastly, \"Russian owned WikiLeaks\" is the most silly, uninformed, and ignorant point of your whole comment.
