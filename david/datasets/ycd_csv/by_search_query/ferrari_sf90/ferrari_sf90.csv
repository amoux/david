Es geht bei Tests nicht nur um die Reifen, obwohl das schwarze Gold nat√ºrlich extrem wichtig ist. Ferrari hatte zb. in der Vergangenheit eine ganz-ganz enge Kooperation mit Bridgestone. Da wurden die Reifen sozusagen ma√ügeschneidert. Andere Teams f√ºhlten sich sogar benachteiligt. (heute nat√ºrlich ""nahezu"" unm√∂glich) Aber wer wei√ü, was da f√ºr Daten hin und her geschoben werden. Spionage und Skandale gab's doch schon immer in der F1. (egal in welchem Bereich) Und inoffizielle Tests w√§ren nat√ºrlich illegal, wenn auch nicht ausgeschlossen. Man kann und muss ja so gut wie alles in der Praxis ausprobieren und da geh√∂rt die K√ºhlung, der Motor, Handling, Aerodynamik, Balance und unz√§hlige andere Dinge auch dazu. Nat√ºrlich wird Pirelli keine Reifen dazu liefern, aber es gibt viele Hersteller wo man sicherlich ohne gro√üe Schwierigkeiten √§hnliche Rennreifen beziehen kann. Die kommen nat√ºrlich nicht ansatzweise an die original Pneus heran, aber f√ºr bestimmte Arbeiten wird man die vermutlich auch nutzen k√∂nnen. Und es wird wahrscheinlich auch kleine Hersteller geben die √§hnliches produzieren. Schau, wir d√ºrfen nicht in unseren kleinen Alltags Dimensionen denken. Die Teams wirken zwar unterschiedlich aufgestellt, aber die haben ein Schweine Geld. Und so mancher Besitzer, oder auch Teilhaber ist Milliard√§r. Aber nicht Pesos, oder Lire, sondern Dollar, bzw. ‚Ç¨uro Milliard√§r. Ein Beispiel w√§re Lance Stroll und sein Daddy Dagobert Duck. Wenn der die M√∂glichkeit hat seinen Sohn in ein aktuelles F1 Auto zu setzen, um seine Nichtvorhandenen Fahrf√§higkeiten zu verbessern, dann w√ºrde er sie unter Garantie nutzen. Mit dem notwendigen Kleingeld wird es einem halt leicht gemacht. Und das gilt wahrscheinlich auch bei Dingen, die normalerweise nicht erlaubt sind, so wie eben inoffizielle Tests.

Motor kann ich auf dem Pr√ºfstand testen und f√ºr Aerodynamik und Setup arbeiten haben die Teams Simulatoren. Und um sich eben nicht nur auf eine Software zu verlassen, gehe ich raus, um unter realen Bedingungen zu testen. Ein Fahrer kann dir nach 100 Metern sagen, ob du ihm ein Soft oder Medium Reifen gegeben hast. Wenn du jetzt bei Bridgestone eine shopping Tour startest, f√ºhlt sich das Auto von der Balance und vom Handling gleich ganz anders an. Hier machen die hohen Reise- und Transportkosten f√ºr so einen verf√§lschten Test keinen Sinn! Da k√∂nnen sie lieber weiter im Simulator ihre Runden drehen! Nat√ºrlich kann ein Team, und darum ging es ja von Anfang an, irgendwo geheim absetzten und fahren, aber der Aufwand und die eingeschr√§nkten und zum Teil verf√§lschten Daten machen ein solches Unterfangen Sinnlos. Wenn es nur um das fahren an sich geht, d√ºrfen Teams z.B. mit alten Jahreswagen der Vorjahre soviel fahren, wie sie wollen.

1110,TKDI for life,UgwDnp5SITsB_aKeE894AaABAg,I think they did 3 things mainly: 1-reproducing an ouwash effect with neutral/negative wing to control airflow out of tyre squirt/turbulence. 2-the middle of the front part raises air from the wing to the sodepods while the central vortexes are heavily outwashed by the barge boards. This probably undercuts the need of a slim area underneath the sodepods which is used to channel the flow inside the lateral structure. That large structure also prevents the ouwash to come too early into the sides of the car. 3-pushing hard to let the outwashed air come into the coke bottle area more violently and orderly. Similar to red bull they pushed the tightness to an unbelievable level and all that air that comes back into the car should hit hard the diffuser with a lot of pressure. Refines the concept of last year!

Those special tyres were only for a few races, but the average driver asked to have them in all races and that's what he got. Regarding oil burning, it was adrian newey that first point that Mercedes are burnig oil back in 2015. At the time, Allison had Ferrari in tye toilet. And for the token rule, the most shameful rule in the history of F1 designed to stop others from catching up. Illegal suspension that FIA was fully aware of, and they banned it as soon as Ferrari wanted to use it. illegal mirror that FIA didn't allow Ferrari to use, but let Mercrdes run it. Same goes with the illegal wheels that FIA is yet to clear it. I expect it to be banned because Ferrari are using it. On top of all, FIA leaking Ferrari's tech secret to a point that in the heavily policed and censored F1 Arrivabene warned FIA against leaking their tech info. The entire 2014-2017 when everyone was sufferings from tyres, FIA didn't give a shit and produced tyres to help the average low-IQ circle alone around race tracks. The scam is so huge that Mercedes can get away with illegal tyre test that gave them massive advantage over others. Mercedes keep hiring Ferrari rejects just to get inside info because they trust their home-grown engineers are not competent enough to make an ERS as good as Ferrari. In ract, Ferrari's ERS/Battery was cleared in 2014, it became a problem when the average low-IQ driver couldn't circle alone around the tracks and his team lost massive advantage after the shameful token rule was lifted. In fact, low-IQ man is so below average that he got his average ass comprehensively handed to him by another average driver like Rosberg. Mercedes is never inspected by FIA, they don't monitor Mercedes car to the level they do Ferrari or other teams.

So you don't get skewed results where someone who has only driven top tier cars comes out on top. Fangio was the best, Proxy, Senna,Alonso and Sterling Moss came in top 5.

Ferrari did have a ""second wind"" (sic), but only in qualifying (indicating a one off overheating). What they were doing with the double batteries still is a mystery, but even though the cars were completely legal, the FIA took it from them anyway. The politicising of it by Toto and Hamilton (""tricks"" in every interview) was childish, however it worked for them by embarrassing the FIA into action. Benz were the first to burn oil, a complete cheat bypassing the very strict fuel flow regulations (FIndia and HAAS both banned in Canada for exceeding the fuel flow), that they weren't stopped after a couple of teams complained, forced other teams to do it as well. Benz should have had their known race results with the known cheat taken away from them. And it was a hands down cheat, not clever, not innovative, just a dirty cheat. And how many races did the blown wheel bullshit go on for ... I would 100% agree there have been periods of time in F1 where teams have been favoured, Ferrari and Renault come immediately to mind, it is now Benz who are clearly being favoured, it's just a fact, and on a far bigger scale than most realise, and it's driving privateers like Williams, out",3 months ago,ferrari_sf90,DNROTNOg558,218,1224,4.6192660550458715,0,5,,,,,0.010732323232323234,0.4597222222222222,positive

Will Vettel beat Hamilton? How will Leclerc do as a rookie in a new top team? Will be out-qualify the veteran? Will he be able to challenge Vettel a bit? How will Hamilton perform this season. Is he still hungry? I bet he is. Will Mercedes still be able to deliver? I bet they will. And Bottas? How will his beard fare against Hamilton? What about Verstappen? Will Honda deliver? Will the Renault badmouthing come back and bite him in the ass? What about Gasly? Will he be able to compete with Verstappen? What about Kimi in an Afla? What about all the new drivers? What about Kubica? What about Williams? Yikes? What about Renault and Ricciardo? What about Ricciardo vs. Hulkenberg? What about Grosjean? Will he be able to keep calm this season?

The Ferrari might very well be the best car this year but if you qualify 4th you're in the mix with Verstappen, Hamilton etc...and might not get any places back. These people might own you even bringing more pressure. + every race you get this. Good car, underperforming...teammate better in qualifying therefore the race, there might be some crashes. Now you have to 'keep it clean' and go faster. At sauber people don't even see you were 0.3 slower in Q than optimal. who cares....still 4tenths faster than your average teammate. At Ferrari all the above things bring more pressure. In short i think it's a tough year for charles leclerc and vettel isnt that bothered. I actually don't think vettel is that sensitive to pressure. His style always been agressive, bordering stupid sometimes. But if you're close to the wdc you lose it at those moments.

I mean Ferrari have always been on top or near the top in testing! But as usual (or since 2014), Mercedes always bags the titles with races to spare! Most of us have been following the sport for a very long time yet some of us keep falling for the usual ""traps"" that testing results tell us. Lots of ""experts"" even come up with terms like ""tire-corrected, ""fuel-corrected""! Really??? Well, sure anyone can spot the tire used, that we can factor in easily. But, even with the C5 tire bolted on and the car does 2 or 3 laps sets a purple laptime and heads back to the pits, how do we know if the car had 3 laps worth of fuel? Was the engine mode aggressive? Was the battery discharge aggressive? Was the driver 100% pushing? Most know Mercedes sandbags alot! I do mean they probably are laughing at all these experts right now!
